So, you would think most investors would be embracing equities.\nBut while stocks represent a larger share of household financial assets than they did five years ago, the share of U.S. adults who own stocks remains stuck at multi-year lows.\nAt the beginning of September, the Federal Reserve (Fed) published its 2013 edition of the Survey of Consumer Finances. Even as the S&P 500 was closing in on 1,600 last year, well above its March 2009 lows, the report revealed that the share of U.S. households holding stocks actually declined to 48.8% in 2013 from a high of 53.2% in 2007, as the chart below shows.\nFed Survey of Consumer Finances\nSimilarly, Gallup surveys also show a decline in investor stock holdings. According to these polls, during the decade before the financial crisis, roughly 60% of U.S. adults held stocks in their financial portfolios. But since the bull market kicked in five years ago, that ownership share has averaged around 55% - among the lowest ownership percentages since the survey began in 1998.\nThis shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Factors that explain the reticence to embrace stocks include:\nTwo stock market routs in a decade have altered investors' return and volatility assumptions for the asset class, as well as their preference for risky assets. This is especially true among 30- to 50-year-old investors who haven't had the benefit of experiencing more stable market conditions during their investing lifetimes.\nThe Fed's bloated balance sheet and unusually accommodative monetary policy have created a sense among some investors that the subdued expansion may be somewhat artificial.\nHigh government debt levels as a share of U.S. annual economic output, combined with concerns over long-term entitlements and U.S. political dysfunction, have led investors to focus on potential cracks in the economy's foundation.\nGeopolitical risk and worries about the economic outlook overseas have convinced otherwise optimistic investors to take a more guarded stance.\nStubbornly high levels of structural unemployment and wide gaps in incomes limit the universe of potential savers who can own stocks.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-investors-fear-stocks-2014-9"}
