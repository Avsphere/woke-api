They are especially popular with schools and businesses, probably because they average only about $338, according to a report from ABI Research.\nLenovo announced its first entries into the market, the N20 and N20p, on Tuesday. Both feature 11.6-inch displays, 16 GB of internal storage and 100 GB of Google Drive space for $279 and $329, respectively.
