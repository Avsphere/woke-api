A \"summer pain trade\" is lined up, he said.\nBAML's wealth-management division manages $2.35 trillion of their assets.\n\"Private clients still believe in higher growth and a 'good' rise in rates; we believe both views will be challenged in autumn by higher wage growth & Asian economic slowdown,\" Hartnett said in a note on Thursday.\nHartnett previously wrote that this market environment reminded him of 1998, when a credit crisis in Asia forced investors who had big positions in the region to raise cash by selling en masse.\nThe so-called thundering herd has piled into other positions Hartnett is watching closely. Here are a few:\nThey're allocated 61% to stocks, just below the record share of 62.5% recorded in March 2015. But cash levels are near a record low of 10%.\nThey're confident that the global economy still has room to grow. In turn, 43% of their assets in BAML's custody have flowed into Europe, Australasia, and Far East stock funds, versus 9% to US funds.\nTheir allocation in stocks has \"shifted down in quality.\" The one-year beta of their top 20 holdings, dominated by financial, energy, and tech stocks, is at a record high of 1.10. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stocks in question are more volatile than the S&P 500.\nThey've moved \"up in quality\" in rates. BAML's private clients have collectively put 2.3% of their assets into Treasury bills, a 10-year high.\nAdded to these trends is the fact that the firm's Bull & Bear Indicator has veered into \"extreme bearish\" territory, at 2.3 on a scale of zero to 10. It's normally a contrarian indicator, but BAML's quant and equity strategists say there are longer-term reasons for caution on stocks.\nAlso, several bear-market signposts that BAML is watching have been triggered — 14 out of 19, to be exact.\nThe quant and equity strategists ticked off the most recent one this week, after they observed that low-quality stocks — companies with the highest debt and weakest profitability — are outperforming high-quality ones. Also, active managers' exposure to low-quality stocks relative to the broader S&P 500 is near a record level.\nThere's a big signpost that is yet to be triggered: a yield-curve inversion, when the 10-year note's yield rises above the two-year's. Also, BAML's equity strategists still maintain a year-end target of 3,000, implying the market would rise about 7% from current levels.\nBut if Hartnett's observations are correct, it may be time to brace for some pain this summer.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-headed-for-challenging-summer-bank-of-america-says-2018-7"}
