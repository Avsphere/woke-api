They also would help to identify children who have been abused or victims of human trafficking and assist in prosecuting perpetrators, the Department of Justice said in a statement.\nTens of thousands of children have been crossing the nation’s southern border without a parent or adult, swamping select Border Patrol processing stations on the U.S.-Mexico border. Their numbers have forced the administration to open at least two emergency shelters and the president declared the situation a “humanitarian crisis.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/president-obama-wants-provide-border-children-legal-help-n124721"}
