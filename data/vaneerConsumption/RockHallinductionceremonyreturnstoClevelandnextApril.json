The event instead has been held in New York. The hall said last year that it would have the ceremony in Cleveland every two years starting in 2018.\nThe Rock Hall announced the date of that ceremony on Wednesday. It says a series of events leading up to the induction will include a community celebration with free admission to the facility.\nThis year's ceremony was held April 7 in Brooklyn. The inductees were Pearl Jam, Tupac Shakur, Joan Baez, Electric Light Orchestra, Journey and Yes.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4447670/Rock-Hall-induction-ceremony-returns-Cleveland-April.html"}
