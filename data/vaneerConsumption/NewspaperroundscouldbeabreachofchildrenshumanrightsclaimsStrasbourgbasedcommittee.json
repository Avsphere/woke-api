The Strasbourg-based council has also tried to enforce rulings of the European Court of Human Rights on prisoner votes and ‘life means life’ jail terms.\nTory MP Philip Hollobone condemned the report. He said: ‘This is yet more barmy interference from unelected bureaucrats in Strasbourg.’\nThe 15-man committee, which answers to the Council of Europe, also criticised British laws on smacking, immigration, gypsy rights and maternity pay (image posed by models)\nThe eurocrats say immigration rules are unfair because they breach the ‘social rights’ of migrant workers and their families.\nThey say it is wrong that relatives can be expelled from the country after the deportation of their sponsor even if there is no proof ‘they are a threat to national security, or offend against public interest or morals’.\nThey also attack language rules which force new arrivals to learn English, saying they are ‘likely to hinder family reunion’.\nLast week David Cameron announced new rules requiring migrants to learn English or face losing their right to stay in the country.\nThe report says minimum income levels designed to stop spouses and children from overseas becoming a burden on the state are too high. The minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds – less than £4 per hour – is ‘not fair’ and too low.\nMaternity pay is ‘inadequate’ and all smacking of children should be banned, they say. Currently the law allows parents to smack their children as long as it is ‘reasonable chastisement’ and they are not badly hurt.\nIt said: ‘The committee has noted that there is now a wide consensus at both the European and international level among human rights bodies that the corporal punishment of children should be expressly and comprehensively prohibited in law.’\nThey criticise the age of criminal responsibility for being too low at ten in England and Wales and eight in Scotland. They say at that age children cannot differentiate between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3420164/Now-eurocrats-call-ban-paper-rounds-holiday-jobs.html"}
