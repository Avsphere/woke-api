The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nMASSIVE SPOILER ALERT! The burning question left in the wake of the latest episode of \"Game of Thrones\" is not whether the Night's Watch will survive the Wildlings' attack, but whether it's possible for a human to crush an adversary's cranium with his or her bare hands.\nSaying anything more about the grisly ending of the \"Mountain vs. Red Viper\" trial by combat, which sealed the fate of a major character (or did it?!), would go way over the spoiler line.\nLet's just say that this biomechanical conundrum has come up several times before in a cinematic context. The same question was raised when Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan character dispatched a foe in \"Star Trek Into Darkness,\" or when Rutger Hauer's replicant character offed his creator in \"Blade Runner.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/game-thrones-question-whats-it-take-crush-skull-n121436"}
