I think the states can take a look at this issue. Many of them have tried to tighten their voter rolls, tried to purge people who are dead,” McConnell said.\nTrump says he lost the popular vote by three to five million votes because of illegal immigrants in a meeting with congressional leaders at the White House, the Hill reported.\nOn Jan. 25, Trump called for a “major investigation” into the alleged voter fraud that would crack down on people registered in multiple states and deceased citizens still on voter rolls.\nHe reportedly considered signing an executive order on the subject, but “the administration has not taken any public action on the issue in roughly the past 10 days.”\nDespite McConnell’s reluctance to investigate the issue at the federal level, Trump is still standing by his claim that illegal immigrants cost him the popular vote.\n“Many people have come out and said I am right,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/02/05/mcconnell-no-federal-money-investigating-voter-fraud/"}
