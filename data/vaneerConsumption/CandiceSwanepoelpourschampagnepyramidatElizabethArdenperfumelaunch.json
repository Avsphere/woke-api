Itâ€™s not just about posing for shoots. People know your name and your personality.'\nHigh pressure indeed for the professional lingerie wearer, who is worth an impressive $19 million. She is the eight highest paid model in the world according to Forbes and last year pulled in an estimated $5 million.\nSheer delight: The gentlemen at the event found it difficult to concentrate on the product being hawked by the blonde beauty","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3422282/Candice-Swanepoel-steady-hand-pours-champagne-pyramid-sheer-dress-perfume-launch.html"}
