The NSA has previously been accused of spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and on Brazilian and Mexican leaders.\nThe BBC reports that none of the leaks is considered earth-shattering. In one Jacques Chirac pushes for the nomination of Terje Roed-Larsen as UN under-secretary-general. Nicolas Sarkozy says he wants to help Pernod Ricard in a row with the US over rum. Three days after taking office, Francois Hollande calls secret meetings to discuss the Greek crisis.\nDespite the tame nature of the revelations, US Ambassador Jane Hartley has been called to account to by French officials.\nMs Hartley is expected to visit the foreign ministry in Paris on Wednesday afternoon. A statement from the French presidency (in French) said the US must respect a promise not to spy on French leaders.\nThe French statement came after an emergency meeting of security chiefs in Paris. Previous diplomatic cables published on the WikiLeaks website dating from the 1970s revealed that US diplomats at the time were closely monitoring two future French presidents, Chirac and his predecessor, François Mitterrand.\nReacting to outrage from France on Wednesday morning, the White House insisted it was no longer targeting Hollande’s communications and would not do so in the future.\n“We are not targeting and will not target the communications of President Hollande,” National Security Council spokesman Ned Price told reporters late on Tuesday, calling the US partnership with France “indispensable” but without addressing what might have been done in the past.\nWikiLeaks said French readers could “expect more timely and important revelations in the near future”.\nAdditional reporting via AFP","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/06/24/french-anger-at-claims-us-spied-on-its-last-three-presidents/"}
