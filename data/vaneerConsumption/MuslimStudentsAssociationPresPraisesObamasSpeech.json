That if we, as an American community unite against that sort of thing, I think it will go a long way.”\nRustom, who says she grew up in America and is “as American as any other student that’s here,” said it is disappointing for Muslim students to have their religion continually tied to terrorism.\nMuslim students on the UW-Madison campus are condemning the actions of ISIS, says Rustom, according to Obama’s statement to the Muslim community in America.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/12/07/muslim-students-association-president-praises-obamas-terrorism-speech/"}
