This (last) match has probably proved that more than most.”\nEven before England began their campaign, Morgan sensed they were a united force.\n“I think we’ve gelled really well,” he added. “We had plenty of time in St Kitts to really get to know each other - we did a lot of socialising within the group, that doesn’t always necessarily happen within all teams.”\nMorgan gave particular mention to 31-year-old Plunkett, who finished the series with 10 wickets at an average of just 9.9.\nLiam Plunkett\n“I think Liam in particular has never let us down. We’ve backed him up with selection for quite a while now, and he continues to impress us.”\nSteven Finn also took his unexpected opportunity to help lead the attack after David Willey missed the tour with a shoulder injury and Jake Ball pulled up in the second warm-up fixture.\n“Finny is probably a different case – he’s growing in confidence and stature, which are great signs for the summer,” added Morgan.\n“He probably came here thinking he wasn’t going to play a great deal … but he’s bowled really well.”\nHales’ hundred figured in a second-wicket stand of 192 with fellow centurion Joe Root as England piled up 328 all out at the Kensington Oval - cementing the record-breaking opener’s claim to partner Jason Roy this summer.\nAlex Hales\n“The partnership between him and Jason has obviously grown over the last two years,” said Morgan.\n“We’ve invested a lot of games in him - but before this game, he has rewarded us with runs.\n“Jason is an extremely explosive player, and Halesy realises that - so he plays his part in strong partnerships between them.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4301266/Eoin-Morgan-pleased-England-progress-ahead-Champions-Trophy.html"}
