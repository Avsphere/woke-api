There will be at least two entries: one on the northeast side and one on the south-facing side of the area.”\nREAD: Scammers are targeting DeKalb residents with this fake fine trick\nREAD: 13 events to find a job this month in DeKalb\nREAD: Gusto! is opening new location in DeKalb\nSome of the funding will be used for the installation of a 1,000 foot fence to close nearly five acres in the 20-acre park that will be designated for pet lovers and their animals. The rest of the park will be available for others.\nThe city said a number of other park improvements are also under consideration, with dog-friendly amenities including a dog-washing station with two bays for simultaneous washing of dogs; more “doggy and me” water fountains; additional pet stations; and more leash stations.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter\nIn other news:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/brookhaven-getting-world-class-dog-park/fv8eMP444ywr0EDGqmaBiP/"}
