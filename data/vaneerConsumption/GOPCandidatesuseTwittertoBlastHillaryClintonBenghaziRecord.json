Mike Huckabee, who has been highly critical of Clinton’s whereabouts the night of the attack in Benghazi — September 11, 2012 — where four Americans were killed, is tuning into Clinton’s testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi even while on the campaign trail between events.\nGOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina posted on Twitter a video of her speaking about the “Clinton Way” of doing business.\nThis is the ‘Clinton Way.’ She cannot be president. https://t.co/oxPOe7pztw — Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) October 22, 2015\n“Hillary Clinton must not be President of the United States, but not because she is a woman. Hillary Clinton cannot be President of the United States because she is not trustworthy,” Fiorina states.\nWe are learning once again what the Clinton way is. The Clinton way, “do as I say not as I do,” the Clinton way, “lets rake in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors,” “lets promise transparency, which we never intend to keep.” Now, of course they’re scrambling to re-file their tax returns, and account for her decisions as Secretary of State. And I tell you what, when the general election rolls around we better have a nominee that can throw those punches all day long.\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump posted on Twitter his opinion of Hillary Clinton’s record the day before her testimony in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi – the same day Vice President Joe Biden decided not to enter the presidential race to be the Democrat nominee.\nI think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2015\nOn the day of Clinton’s testimony Trump’s Twitter account retweeted:\n“@toddinwichita @realDonaldTrump Hillary is doing a HORRIBLE job at #BenghaziHearings reading from the script. #pathetic . She is no leader” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2015\nGOP presidential candidate former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush weighed in on Twitter about Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State on Thursday:\nBenghazi security failures were a stunning example of an incompetent foreign policy. @HillaryClinton’s role as SOS deserves scrutiny today. — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 22, 2015\nFellow GOP candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also took to Twitter to comment on Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi testimony in a series of three tweets:\nOn @HillaryClinton watch the U.S. consulate in Benghazi became a death trap. #BenghaziCommittee — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 22, 2015\nI agree with @HillaryClinton they can’t operate from bunkers, but they shouldn’t be required to operate in death traps. #BenghaziCommittee — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 22, 2015","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/22/gop-candidates-use-twitter-blast-hillary-clinton-benghazi-record/"}
