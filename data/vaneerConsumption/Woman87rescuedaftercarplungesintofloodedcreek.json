Then other firefighters arrived — apparently somebody had called 911 — and deployed a 35-foot ladder to help get the woman up the steep bank, he said.\nThe accident and rescue happened at 8:30 a.m. at Toonigh Creek on Holly Springs Parkway near the Home Depot, Cherokee County Battalion Chief Ricky Collett said.\nCollett said that the rescue “was truly a Christmas miracle.”","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/woman-rescued-after-car-plunges-into-flooded-creek/6OgFVCBBAZ4APe3zeTwF5J/"}
