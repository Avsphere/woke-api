Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley trails both rivals in the race.\nAccepting the endorsement Sunday in New Hampshire, Clinton sought to energize her Democratic base with a passionate pledge to always protect reproductive rights.\n'I will always defend Planned Parenthood and I will say consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported and protected, not undermined, misrepresented and demonized,' Clinton said. 'As your president, I will always have your back.'\nPartnership: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addresses an audience during an event on Sunady in Hooksett, N.H., during which Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in the presidential race\nCheering fans: Women in the audience hold placards and cheer in an event on Sunday during which Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was endorsed by Planned Parenthood\nClinton supporter: Valerie Marchesi, of Merrick, N.Y., dresses in a costume representing oral contraceptive pills before the start of the event on Sunday honoring Hillary Clinton\nClinton painted a dark picture of what women's health care would look like under a Republican president, singling out two of the top Republican contenders by name.\n'Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and their powerful friends may be trying to drag us back to the Stone Age, but we've got our sights set on the future,' Clinton said.\nClinton said Republicans would 'accelerate the assault on access to safe and legal abortion,' according to CNN.\nAnd she offered a nod to the competitive state of her own primary in the first voting states.\n'I need your help, starting here in the New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucus,' she said.\n'We can win this election.'\nPlanned Parenthood is a large provider of abortion and reproductive health services and has become a lightning rod in the 2016 campaign.\nMost Republican presidential candidates object to continued federal financing of the organization and a measure has passed the Republican-led House to stop the flow of money.\nThe right to choose: Accepting the endorsement Sunday in New Hampshire, Clinton sought to energize her Democratic base with a passionate pledge to always protect reproductive rights\nMoving forward: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, left, stands with Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood's president, during the event on Sunday\nClinton was introduced on Sunday by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards who said she believes Clinton is the type of candidate who will represent women's rights.\nShe is the 'leader I trust in the White House to make sure women and families move forward.'\nRichards said in an interview before the event that while Sanders is a 'very solid vote' for their organization, she 'could never remember a time where there is a stronger candidate for president [than Hillary Clinton] on the issues that are fundamental to Planned Parenthood,' according to CNN.\nRichards said Planned Parenthood is making an early endorsement so that it can begin reminding voters about the Republican candidates' 'extreme' positions on abortion rights and women's health. The group plans to spend at least $20 million in the 2016 campaign.\n'I don't know that it has been particularly clear in the Republican primary just exactly how extreme these candidates are,' Richards said.\nOpponents: 'Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and their powerful friends may be trying to drag us back to the Stone Age, but we've got our sights set on the future,' Clinton said\nPlanned Parenthood's candidate: Richards said in an interview before the event that while Sanders is a 'very solid vote' for their organization, she 'could never remember a time where there is a stronger candidate for president [than Hillary Clinton] on the issues that are fundamental to Planned Parenthood'\nAlthough Planned Parenthood doesn't plan to campaign negatively against Sanders and O'Malley, Richards highlighted Clinton's long record of supporting women's health care, from her time at the Children's Defense Fund to tenure as first lady and a U.S. Senator from New York.\n'We don't need just a friend, a solid vote, a supporting statement â€” we need a fighter,' Richards said.\nMany Republicans stepped up their criticism of Planned Parenthood after anti-abortion-rights activists released underground video that showed an official from the group talking about the price of fetal parts. The video did not establish that the group was illegally profiting from the sale of fetal parts as some alleged.\n'A lot of the Republicans are kind of fact averse,' Clinton said, referencing the GOP reaction to the videos. 'They do seem to live in an evidence-free zone.'\nSelfies: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton uses a mobile device while taking a selfie with people in the audience following the Planned Parenthood event on Sunday\nReeling in voters: 'We need a Democratic nominee who will be able to beat the Republicans and get the job done for Americans, 'Clinton said. She is pictured here posing up with fans at the packed event\nClinton warned the crowd that electing a Republican president would eliminate Democrats' fire wall between a repeal of the president's health care overhaul law, GOP efforts to de-fund Planned Parenthood and the appointment of 'right wing' justices to the Supreme Court.\n'We need a Democratic nominee who will be able to beat the Republicans and get the job done for Americans, 'Clinton said.\n'The next president would easily appoint more than one justice to the Supreme Court,' she added.\n'That fight is not over either. Access to affordable birth control is still hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court,' Clinton said.\n'If a Republican wins this election and gets the chance to stack the Supreme Court with right-wing justices, together they will accelerate the move to take America in the wrong direction on so many issues that you and I have fought for,' she said. 'I shudder to think what Republicans would do if given the chance.'\nThe event was not only attended by supporters. Some protestors of Planned Parenthood stood outside the venue with signs saying, 'Planned Parenthood sells baby parts,' and 'women do not need Planned Parenthood.'\nBig smiles: Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is seen on a monitor as she works the rope line after receiving an endorsement from Planned Parenthood Action Fund at Southern New Hampshire University","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3392991/Planned-Parenthood-backing-Clinton-primary-race.html"}
