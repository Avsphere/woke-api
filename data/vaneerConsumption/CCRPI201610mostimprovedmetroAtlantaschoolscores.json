Schools are scored on a 0 to 100 point scale, with a possibility of 10 additional points.\nAny score below 60 is considered failing.\nThe AJC has created the The Ultimate Atlanta School Guide that lets you look at and compare critical data for every school in Georgia.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/ccrpi-2016-most-improved-metro-atlanta-school-scores/BIho4iUnXcvHDVJ9Xw6hXN/"}
