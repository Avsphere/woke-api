In the lead-up to last year's Victoria's Secret show, she revealed that she sometimes worked out twice a day.\nBut what exactly does a workout for Kendall entail? Here, in a piece for Healthista, her Los Angeles-based personal trainer, Gunnar Peterson, explains all.\nKendall Jenner is in tip top shape – her washboard abs and lengthy toned legs being almost as famous as the classic Kardashian derriere (pictured attending Harper's Bazaar 150th anniversary event in New York City last week)\nWhen Gunnar answered the phone it was 5.30am in LA. He was doing his morning cycle on a bike at his gym in Beverley Hills.\nWhen I told him I was impressed with the early start he shrugged it off saying 'it's what you've got to do'.\nGunnar is one of the most sought-after trainers in the US and can boast Jennifer Lopez, Angelina Jolie and the Kardashians as his clients – although he won't.\nStop trying to be Kendall Jenner 2.0. Be you – the best you is always better than a knock off of anyone else Gunnar Peterson\nWhen I asked him who he'd trained he laughed, 'I'll never throw that s**t out, you can Google that s**t.'\nThis was typical of his hilariously upfront manner – it quickly became clear he has a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to health and fitness when he jokingly invited me to LA to attempt Jenner's workout.\nHe said: 'Kendall is in here busting her ass, I challenge you to do her workout. I'll put you through it, you come over.'\nBut he wasn't always the fitness guru that he is today, explaining that when he was young he was overweight. He said: 'I was always a fat kid.\n'My mum even had me in weight watchers when I was ten years old.'\nIn the lead-up to last year's Victoria's Secret show, she revealed that she sometimes worked out twice a day (Kendall's incredible physique captured on an Instagram post in January)\nBut what exactly does a workout for Kendall entail? Here, her personal trainer, Gunnar Peterson, explains all (pictured left at the world premiere of Zoolander 2 in New York in February, and right on day one of Winter Bumbleland, California earlier this month)\nDespite this, he'd always had an interest in working out and he really got into his fitness when he went to university.\nSoon after, people at the gym were asking him to coach them and today he has worked an impressive 28 years in the industry.\nHOW SHOULD WE PLAN OUR WORKOUTS?\nWrite it out the night before, take ten minutes. Put it on the notes app on your phone. Or go old school and write it on a piece of paper.\nHOW DID KENDALL TRAIN? Gunnar Peterson revealed how before last year's Victoria's Secret show, she was in his Beverley Hills gym five days a week. But she wasn't doing much strength training, it was more a combination of movement, strength and high-intensity intervals. His aim was to make her feel happy with the way that she looks and is still able to move at the end of the workout. If he saw her struggling with a certain weight towards the end of her rep range, he would reduce it. He told Healthista: 'You can't cripple a runway model. I can't destroy her legs with some kind of crazy routine. 'So she could be in here and do a set of squats, a set of pull ups, drop down into a plank series a set of hypo extensions. 'It's all about throwing a curve ball at the body – the body has to adapt because when it adapts it changes.' Gunnar firmly believes that Kendall enjoys the workouts, which is known to be key in a successful exercise regime. He added: 'She's here regularly, she works her ass off. Kendall is a natural athlete. 'It's a pleasure to work with her. When she comes in it's like working with one of my pro-athletes.'\nMy friend Brad and I send stuff back and forth to each other every night, Instagram video is great for that. It's the same reason I pull my clothes out at night for the following day.\nI get up at 3.45 in the morning, I don't want to stand there, eyes glazed over, staring at my closet. I don't want to have to make those decisions, I want to be able to execute.\nWHAT CARDIO:WEIGHTS RATIO DO YOU SUGGEST?\nListen to your body, see what feels better. And if it feels better but you're not seeing results then change it up, go against the grain.\nI would recommend a combination of multi-joint strengths move a couple of high-intensity interval movements.\nSo a squat press – that's a strength move that is going to pump your heart rate up.\nAnd then I would do some kind of a sixty-second sprint on either a bike a rower or a treadmill – whatever you have available.\nWHAT IS THE BEST GO-TO TYPE OF EXERCISE?\nI really don't think everybody should be doing the same thing. It's going to come down to your goals, needs, ability, injury history, sports history and available time to commit.\nBut if you're looking to change the way your body looks you should spend less time on single joint finishing isolating movements when it comes to strength training and you should invest more in multi-joint movements that involve all three plains of motion and movements that give you a metabolic return above and beyond just the time spent in the gym.\nGunnar Peterson, her Los Angeles-based personal trainer, said: 'Stop trying to be Kendall Jenner 2.0. Be you – the best you is always better than a knock off of anyone else'\nGunnar is one of the most sought-after trainers in the US and can boast Jennifer Lopez, Angelina Jolie and the Kardashians as his clients (pictured going through one of his own regimes at his Beverley Hills gym)\nHe wasn't always the fitness guru that he is today, explaining that when he was young he was overweight (pictured doing an abs routine at his gym)\nSO STRENGTH TRAINING IS IMPORTANT TO YOU?\nYes, and it should be really important for you too.\nIS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GET A BODY LIKE KENDALL? Gunnar said: 'I cautioned a woman about this 27 years ago in the gym and I can still remember the conversation. 'She looked all downtrodden and later it completely changed her approach to exercise. 'Stop trying to be Kendall Jenner 2.0. Be you – the best you is always better than a knock off of anyone else. 'If you're 5'2\", 148Ibs and you have curves – that's not Kendall Jenner's body. 'Aspire to be a very healthy, sexy, in-shape 5'2\" and don't get obsessed with the scale. 'You get a girl like Kendall who says \"I just want some rocking curves, I want a big ass and big boobs. I just want to look curvier\". 'Don't hitch your wagon to something that is just not there. 'If you use it to inspire you it's fine but if you're aspiring to it that's a long road and that's just fraught with disappointment – don't do it to yourself.'\nIf you don't have time for cardio and strength then I would recommend you do a strength programme with very limited downtime. So you go movement to movement to movement and in between, you add intervals.\nHigh-intensity intervals that would go anywhere from 30 to 120 seconds – that's how you're going to get the most return.\nWomen are often worried about getting big but relax – you're not going to get big, you don't produce enough testosterone to get big.\nAnd you're certainly not going to lift heavy enough on a regular basis to get big.\nGetting fat, on the other hand, that's a whole different story. I can give you three recommendations for that and you could knock them all out today.\nWHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO STAY MOTIVATED?\nLook at the lifestyle you want. If you want to go to Palma, Ibiza, Majorca this summer and you want to go out on a beach, you know what that looks like. You know what your friends are going to wear – if you're unhappy, there's your motivation.\nFor me, it's about being in the game every day and it's about my kids.\nDo I want to be the guy sitting on the sideline with an oxygen tank watching my kids play football or do I want to be the guy who plays in the backyard with my kids?\nGunnar said: 'Kendall is a natural athlete. It's a pleasure to work with her. When she comes in it's like working with one of my pro-athletes' (pictured on the runway at Victoria's Secret show at Grand Palais, Paris, on November 30 last year)\nWHAT DO MOST OF US GET WRONG?\nI think sometimes people throw in the towel too quickly. You didn't get in the current shape you're not happy with overnight.\nI've heard people say 'I've been good for three weeks' and I'm like 'well you've been bad for 36 years'.\nI'm not going to say it's going to take you 36 years to get it back but damn, pay in a little bit.\nThe other thing is you see that fitness ADHD where people jump around. One week it's yoga, the next week it's pilates then they're doing strength.\nIf you're just doing it because you're chasing the result then its fairly short lived. Get involved in the journey, get involved in the process and best yourself. Then when you get to the goal its almost like it's a side effect.\nDO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE CHEAT MEAL?\nIt's funny, I cheat every day but I only cheat a little. It's like a crime – the cheat meal.\nI jaywalk every day and I don't commit murder on Sunday. There are the people who have a cheat and they think they can have an unlimited quantity of it.\nHave a piece of pizza, have two pieces of pizza but a whole pizza? It's just over-cheating.\nI always go to chocolate. Milk chocolate, not even dark chocolate. I can't stand dark chocolate.\nI lived in London as a kid. When I walked home from the little school there I stopped and got a Cadbury Dairy Milk bar every day as a fat kid.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4447066/Want-look-hot-Kendall-Jenner.html"}
