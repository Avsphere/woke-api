The anti-Israel group calls for boycotting merchandise imported from all of Israel and not just those manufactured in the settlements.\nSamuels added: “We urge you to invoke your municipal integrity to publicly condemn BDS and take measures for the rapid eviction of these hooligans from Villa Ichon.”\nSpokeswoman for Bremen’s cultural department, Alexandra Albrecht, told the Post that the city councilor for culture, Carmen Emigholz, “called at an institutional meeting a year ago for those present to not allow events in their buildings that agitate against Israel.”\nEven though, according to Albrecht, Emigholz opposes the boycott of Israel, she was criticized for not doing more to prevent using public facilities for anti-Israel activity.\n“I find it incomprehensible that Bremen’s culture minister [Emigholz], who can play a positive role in preventing the use of public buildings for BDS, is refraining from taking action. It should now be quite clear to everyone, particularly Germany, that BDS is another form of anti-Semitism,” Efraim Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Center’s chief Nazi-hunter, told the Post.\nSamuels, from the Wiesenthal Center, wrote: “Mr. Mayor, if you are proud to see BDS as a ‘cultural and social’ phenomenon, the image of Bremen is sadly tarnished.”\nIn addition to the Villa Ichon, other cultural centers in Bremen, including the Überseemuseum natural history and ethnographic museum, the municipal library, and the Weserterrassen community center provided space to BDS advocates.\nKlaus Hübotter, the head of Villa Ichon’s management organization, told the Post, “The Peace Forum is not an anti-Semitic organization. We don’t tolerate anti-Semitic organizations in our Villa Ichon.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/06/05/simon-wiesenthal-center-german-bds-hooligans-in-cahoots-with-city-officials-carrying-out-nazi-like-israel-boycotts/"}
