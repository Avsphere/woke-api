Statements of financial interest don’t give specific amounts of compensation but rather whether compensation is at least a specific amount.\nA phone call to the judge’s chambers in Fayetteville was not returned Tuesday.\nMartin’s order came in the midst of Goodson’s re-election campaign for a seat on the high court. In that race, both she and another opponent, Court of Appeals Judge Kenneth Hixson, have been the target of hundreds of thousands of dollars in TV ads paid for by out-of-state groups.\nGoodson on Monday also filed a lawsuit aimed at halting some attack ads in the Little Rock area, and a judge was scheduled to hold a hearing in that case Friday morning. Goodson filed a third lawsuit Tuesday to halt the ads in the Fort Smith area.\nA third candidate in the race, Department of Human Services attorney David Sterling, has denied any affiliation with the ads.\nRead Wednesday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/15/judge-who-blocked-ads-against-arkansas-high-court-/?page=1"}
