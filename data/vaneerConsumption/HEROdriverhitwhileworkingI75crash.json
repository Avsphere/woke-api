Seslar was putting out flares to block the roadway after an earlier wreck when he was hit by a 1998 Ford pickup truck.\nThe pickup driver, Richard K. Hutto, 38, of Fitzgerald, apparently struck a guard rail first, then over-corrected and hit Seslar, a GSP spokesperson said in an email.\nHutto, who was not injured, was charged with reckless driving, failure to maintain lane, driving too fast for conditions, driving on a suspended license, failure to exercise due care and to obey the state’s “move over” law that requires drivers to move over a lane when approaching an emergency vehicle.\nChannel 2 Action News reported that Seslar was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in stable condition.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/hero-driver-hit-while-working-crash/qGM9OoT2bJRHTT8r6COLJK/"}
