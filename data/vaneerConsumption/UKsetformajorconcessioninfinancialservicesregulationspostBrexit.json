It is tightly linked to membership of the single market, so will not apply to the UK once Britain leaves the EU, given the government's desire to also leave the single market.\nWhile Hammond favoured this model, it was roundly rejected by the EU side of negotiations, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier saying in a speech on Tuesday that this plan did not provide adequate \"safeguards.\"\n\"The UK needs to understand that the EU cannot accept such mutual market access without all the safeguards that underpin it,\" Barnier told an audience at the European American Chamber of Commerce in New York.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-set-for-major-concession-in-financial-services-regulations-post-brexit-2018-7"}
