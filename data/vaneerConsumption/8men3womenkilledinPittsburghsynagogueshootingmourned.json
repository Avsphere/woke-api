All had come to the Tree of Life temple in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning to pray and find peace in each other's company, only to be targeted by an alleged killer with a twisted anti-Semitic motive.\nA day after the rampage at the synagogue in the normally tranquil neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, loved ones and friends of the 11 people gunned down were left mourning and outraged by the explosion of deadly hate that entered their beloved place of worship.\n\"The fact that this attack took place during a worship service makes it even more heinous,\" Scott Brady, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said at a news conference in Pittsburgh on Sunday morning. \"A place of worship is a sacred place. It's a place of peace and a place of grace. It's a place where a community comes together. And this, of course, is our first freedom as a people.\"\nAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\nThe names of those killed in the Saturday morning massacre, allegedly carried out by Robert Gregory Bower, 46, of Pittsburgh, were released Sunday by the Allegheny County medical examiner.\nThe oldest victim was 97-year-old Rose Mallinger, who lived in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood and was a faithful member of the Tree of Life temple.\nBernice Simon, 84, and her husband, Sylvan, 86, were married at the Tree of Life synagogue in December 1956, and died together there on Saturday.\n\"They held hands and they always smiled and he would open the door for her, all those things that you want from another person,\" a neighbor of the couple, Heather Abraham, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. \"They were really generous and nice to everybody. It’s just horrific.\"\nBrothers Cecil and David Rosenthal were at the synagogue together and were gunned down, officials said. Cecil was 59 years old, while his brother was 54.\nThe Rosenthal brothers were inseparable and attended services at the synagogue every Saturday, said Chris Schopf, vice president of ACHIEVA, a Pittsburgh residential and employment program for people with disabilities that the siblings received assistance from.\n\"They loved life. They loved their community. They spent a lot of time at the Tree of Life, never missing a Saturday,\" Schopf said in a statement. \"They were as much a part of the ACHIEVA family as they were their beloved neighborhood of Squirrel Hill. Our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy to the Rosenthal family, and to all those affected by the tragedy at Tree of Life.\"\nFreddy Rabner, a member of the Tree of Life, said Cecil Rosenthal \"didn't have a mean bone in his body.\"\n\"He was a jovial guy. He greeted everyone who walked into the synagogue with a handshake,\" Rabner said. \"He's one of the guys if I'm driving home from work, I'd toot my horn and he'd give us a wave. He's a good-hearted individual who was the victim of senseless violence.\"\nScott Levin, a longtime member of the synagogue, said the Rosenthal brothers had been attending services there since they were little boys.\nHe said the brothers were slain in a temple they considered \"their safe spot.\"\n\"They lived for the temple,\" Levin said. \"They were always there and never missed a service. They were loved by everyone. It was like a home to them.\"\nVictim Joyce Fienberg, 75, was originally from Toronto, Canada, where she grew up a member of the Holy Blossom Temple, Rabbi Yael Splankey posted on Facebook Sunday.\n\"She was married here.

Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh.\nAP\nDaniel Stein, 71, and Melvin Wax, 88, both of Squirrel Hill, were also shot to death.\nLaw Claus, former Allegheny County deputy district attorney, said Rabinowitz was his family's physician.\n\"Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz was more than just a physician for me and my family; for over three decades he was truly a trusted confidant and healer who could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor,\" Claus told ABC affiliate station WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh. \"He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best.\"\nThe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center tweeted that Rabinowitz was affiliated with its Shadyside Hospital.\n\"Jerry was above all one of the kindest physicians and human beings in our community,\" UPMC tweeted.\nTami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, released a statement mourning the loss of Rabinowitz.\n\"Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith,\" Minnier said in her statement. \"His loss is devastating, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and fellow UPMC colleagues who loved him.\"\n\"The UPMC family, in particular UPMC Shadyside, cannot even begin to express the sadness and grief we feel over the loss of Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz.
