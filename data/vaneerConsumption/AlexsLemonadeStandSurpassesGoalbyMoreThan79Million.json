The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nLittle Alexandra Scott hoped a cure to childhood cancer was as easy as lemons, sugar and water â€” or in other words, lemonade. While bravely battling neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer, Scott set up a lemonade stand that benefited her children's hospital. Her goal was to raise $1 million for research, and she met that goal just two months before she lost her battle with cancer.\nAlex's Lemonade Stand Foundation was started in 2005, in memory of Scott. The organization has now raised more than $80 million.\nAlexandra Scott's legacy lives on with children like Katie Kress. Kress was diagnosed with Lymphoma last year and is going to set up her own lemonade stand.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/alexs-lemonade-stand-surpasses-goal-more-79-million-n125736"}
