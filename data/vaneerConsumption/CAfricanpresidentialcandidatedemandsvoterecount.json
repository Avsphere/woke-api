Around 230,000 votes went \"uncounted and thus were not attributed to candidates,\" the statement said.\nLast week, a score of presidential candidates denounced alleged fraud in the election and called for a halt to the process, but 18 of them went on jointly to back Touadera, an outsider they called \"the only real political alternative.\"\n\"Manipulation and the confiscation of the people's expression of sovereignty have in the past always been the main factors in instability and regression,\" said the MLPC, which won general elections in 1993, three years after the introduction of a multi-party system.\nCAR has been riven by coups, rebellions, army mutinies and prolonged strikes. The latest unrest, the worst violence since independence from France in 1960, has set mainly Muslim rebels against vigilantes from the Christian majority, with civilians as the prime targets.\nFrance, the African Union and the European Union have deployed troops amid fears that the conflict might escalate into a genocide. A transitional regime was formed in 2014 to pave the way for elections.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393910/C-African-presidential-candidate-demands-vote-recount.html"}
