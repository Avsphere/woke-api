The photographs were taken at Excelsior Tunnel in Callington, Cornwall, by a man who grew up in the area. Here his friend travels down the passageway to explore\nWhile civilians and Cornish residents carried on as normal, beneath the ground weapon experts were trialing potentially dangerous explosives.\nAccording to newspaper cuttings between 1959 and 1960, some 75 explosions were carried out.\nBut CornwallLive reported local people didn't seem phased - or aware - of what was happening.\nWeapons were fired in 6ft diameter voids at depths of 100 to 300 feet though no nuclear material was reported to be involved.\nWhy the Cornish site was chosen has never been disclosed but a writer suggested it was selected due to its depth and the fact it had been abandoned for some time.\nPreviously secret files released from the National Archives showed scientists had conducted \"extensive geological investigations\" on mines across Cornwall and Devon.\nInto darkness: The photographer's companion makes his way further into the historic tunnel\nThe document read: 'They were therefore very familiar with these mines and had many of the facilities on tap for reworking them.'\nThe Cornwall site was one of a few chosen places selected by Britain and America to trial weapons during the long war.\nAt Greenside Mine 3,000lb charges were detonated while massive explosions were set off in a salt mine near Louisiana in the United States.\nAnd it was the rumours about the mine's military past which first ignited photographer Nat W's interest, as he heard stories growing up in Callington.\nThis led the 46 year old to daringly visit the site this year - accompanied with a friend and his camera.\nInside the mines, he took a series of shots showing the hidden tunnels which were once used by miners and then the military.\nOne image shows the nondescript entrance, built into the side of the ground, which is largely hidden from view.\nHidden: To passersby, the entrance to the Cornish passage would be easy to walk past as it is covered in foliage and gives no clues away about its military heritage\nHistoric: The tunnel was first dug out in around 1880 to connect to a nearby mine shaft to gain access to tin but this was abandoned half way in\nBut while they were exploring, he admitted he became panicked when he remembered the days of heavy rain - and that no one knew they were there.\nHe said: 'As we progressed into the fascinating tunnel it dawned on us that no-one knew where we were and that the torrential rain from the days before meant a very real chance of a tunnel collapse.'\nBut he said the trip was worthwhile as he finally discovered firsthand a place he had heard about for decades.\nThe photographer said: 'I went to school in Callington which is a town at the bottom of Kit Hill, at school we would run cross country up Kit Hill and there had been persistent rumours that there were tunnels under the it.\n'Despite there being rumours I never met a single person who could actually identify where they were or who had been in them, or even seen them.\n'The rumours that were going around when I was at school made no mention of a military connection.\n'So when as part of my research into urbex locations I heard that not only were there indeed tunnels under Kit Hill but that they were part of a military research project determining how to measure the payload of nuclear weapons I was fascinated.\nThe tunnel was first dug out in around 1880 to connect to a nearby mine shaft to gain access to tin but this was abandoned half way in.\nDuring the Cold War, the tunnel was chosen to become the first site to experiment with the detection of underground explosions under the name, Operation Orpheus to coincide with the United States' Operation Cowboy.\nRumour has it: There is no evidence that nuclear weapons were detonated there but in 1959, the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment exploded small charges into the granite of the tunnel at 100 feet and 300 feet\nAbandoned: The tunnel has been vacated since the tests ended in 1960 and moved to Cumbria\nDecayed: A rusted gate (pictured left) and parts of the general structure (pictured right) have become rusted and aged over time but this didn't stop the photographer and his friend from exploring\nSurprised: The photographer said people are usually surprised to learn that explosive tests were conducted in the village where he went to school\nThere is no evidence that nuclear weapons were detonated there but in 1959, the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment exploded small charges into the granite of the tunnel at 100-feet and 300-feet.\nThe tunnel has been abandoned ever since the tests ended in 1960 and moved to Cumbria.\nThe photographer said: 'My interest in photography centres around contrasts - decay and dirt versus new and renewal, the line between the aesthetic and the intellectual and conceptual, beauty in the mundane.\n'I'm interested in capturing a moment in time via photography.\n'I think that urbex is a particularly interesting area of photography because you clearly record a very transient moment.\n'Either something that will soon be gone, or something that is already decaying, I enjoy making a beautiful photograph from something that is dirty, decaying and mundane.\n'People are universally surprised that these tests were conducted in the village in which I went to school and that no-one really knows about it.'\nDuring the Cold War the Cornish tunnel, which in parts has now collapsed (above), was selected to become the first site to experiment with the detection of underground explosions under the name, Operation Orpheus to coincide with the United States' Operation Cowboy","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4300866/Pictures-reveal-Cornish-tunnel-used-Cold-War.html"}
