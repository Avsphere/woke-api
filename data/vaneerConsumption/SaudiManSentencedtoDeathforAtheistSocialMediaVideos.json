But once you talk in public & criticize God or religion, then you shall be punished,” said one post, according to The Independent.\n“I wish there could be live streaming when you cut his head off,” said another.\nIn March, Breitbart News reported that more citizens of Saudi Arabia had joined ISIS than any other country.\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
