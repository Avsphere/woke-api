The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nOn Sept. 16, 2007, private security guards working for the firm Blackwater Worldwide were escorting diplomats with the U.S. State Department through Baghdad, Iraq, when they got into a firefight that left 14 Iraqis dead and 18 others injured.\nThe circumstances surrounding that incident have been investigated and disputed for nearly seven years, and they will now finally get their day in court — barring any further delays.\nSign up for breaking news alerts from NBC News\nJury selection will begin Wednesday in the trial of four former Blackwater guards, who are charged with crimes ranging from murder to manslaughter to weapons violations.\nThe key question is whether the shootings were an act of defense or an unprovoked attack.\n\"The core disputed issue in this prosecution is self-defense — whether the defendants believed that deadly force was necessary to defend themselves and their teammates from an insurgent attack, and whether that belief was objectively reasonable,\" lawyers for the guards said in court filings.\nThey argued that it's not fair to do \"hindsight analysis in a courtroom seven years and thousands of miles removed from the event.\"\nWhy Is the Blackwater Trial Important?\nThis episode damaged America's reputation in the region and has been repeatedly held up by critics of the George W. Bush administration as an example of why it can be problematic to task private companies with military assignments — although the idea is nothing new.\n\"There have been mercenaries involved in wars for thousands of years.\"\n\"This is really a post-Cold War phenomenon. With the draw-down of the U.S. military, that's when we really started to privatize the military in earnest,\" said Joe Young, a professor of justice, law and criminology at American University in Washington, D.C., and an expert on international extremism who has worked with the Defense Department.\n\"You have all these American, South African, British and Australian special forces who were looking for employment — you start to see groups like DynCorp (a similar firm), Blackwater and other private military who are going all over the world,\" said Young.\nHe noted that beyond the murky legal status of private military operations, they can actually lower the morale of enlisted soldiers, who are often performing the same services for far less pay than the contractors.\nAnd Young added, \"One interesting thing — I've been to several Blackwater services demonstrations — one of the things they'll remind you of: There have been mercenaries involved in wars for thousands of years.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/blackwater-trial-what-you-need-know-n126776"}
