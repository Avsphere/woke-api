I haven’t been back since.”\nRivers of Blood: Boy Killed After Gangs Brawl With Machetes in Enoch Powell’s Old Constituency of Wolverhampton https://t.co/731jB5Okad — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 3, 2018\n“You never knew who was going to start on you, and pull a needle or a knife or a hammer or anything on you,” he said, revealing police have “lost control” of Dale End, with drug dealers operating in the open and homeless people injecting heroin and leaving needles “everywhere in the car park”.\nAccording to the unnamed worker, who was employed as a loss prevention officer to protect the area’s shopping precincts, “all hell breaks out” each weekday afternoon as schoolchildren descend on Birmingham city centre — where locals say they cause “carnage” with mass brawls and “chaos” to local business, robbing shopkeepers and passers-by, while he warned that at night, it “has got to the stage now where it’s not safe to walk down Dale End or Albert Street”.\n“It’s unbelievable, it sounds really bad, it’s worse than that. I see all these different videos of attacks in Alum Rock and Handsworth and gangs on Broad Street — that ain’t nothing. This is happening every single day in Dale End,” he told the Mail.\n“Dale End High Street it’s like a war zone. It is absolutely like a war zone.\nMayor: Our diversity is an asset for the West Midlands https://t.co/LUGArrCA6o — Andy Street (@andy4wm) May 24, 2018","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/06/26/stabbings-shootings-multicultural-midlands/"}
