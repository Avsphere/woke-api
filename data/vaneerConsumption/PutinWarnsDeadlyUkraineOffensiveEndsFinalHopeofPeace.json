The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nMOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine had extinguished the \"final hope\" of a U.S.-backed peace deal after its forces launched an offensive on pro-Russia separatists Friday.\nThe Ukrainian military began its raid on the occupied city of Slovyansk at dawn in what was its most committed attempt to dislodge separatists occupying government buildings across its Russian-speaking, industrial east.\nTwo Ukrainian helicopters were shot down killing at least two people, both sides said. The separatists claimed their forces shot down a third helicopter and said one of their own fighters had also been killed, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency.\nPutin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the offensive “punitive” and said it effectively destroyed the “final hope” of a peace accord reached in Geneva last month between the U.S., Russia, Europe and Ukraine, Interfax said.\nThe clashes came as the German leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel, was in Washington for talks with President Barack Obama on the possibility of slapping further sanctions on Moscow for its actions on its former Soviet neighbor.\nTwo MI-24 helicopters were shot down and one more MI-8 helicopter was damaged by gunfire, according to a Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement.\nFour people were arrested on suspicion of shooting down the helicopters near the city, Ukraine's defense ministry said. Interfax Ukraine also reported that a helicopter pilot had been captured from one of the down aircraft and \"as far as we are informed, he is undergoing surgery in a medical institution,\" the news agency said, quoting Ukraine Defense Minister Yuriy Povkh.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/putin-warns-deadly-ukraine-offensive-ends-final-hope-peace-n95401"}
