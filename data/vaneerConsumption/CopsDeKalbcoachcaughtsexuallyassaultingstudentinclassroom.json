But under Georgia law, that doesn’t matter.\nEfforts to locate Lake for comment weren’t immediately successful Friday.\nThe school district said in a statement last week it was investigating.\n“The matter is also under review by the district and we will respond appropriately,” the statement said. “The health and safety of our students and staff are always our top priorities, and we will continue to ensure that those priorities are met.”\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cops-dekalb-coach-caught-sexually-assaulting-student-classroom/62Eruxjo2gqOTG4rDhJgEN/"}
