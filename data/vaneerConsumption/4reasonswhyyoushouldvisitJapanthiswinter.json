January is a popular time to visit for high amounts of snow, and the month is sometimes playfully referred to as \"Japanuary.\"\nTree Skiing\nShutterstock\nAdventurous skiers looking to get more than just a typical run can take advantage of several resorts that offer tree and night skiing.\nTree skiing is popular in Niseko, where routes like Strawberry Fields wind skiers through shimmering birch trees, while the Kamui Ski Links in Hokkaido provide winter enthusiasts the chance to ski through both trees and bamboo.\nAt Rusutsu, in Hokkaido, which is famous for its deep powder, several runs for tree skiing are spread out making for fewer people and varied terrain.\nOne of the most remarkable natural displays to witness in the country though during your ski getaway are the famed ice trees in the Zao Onsen ski resort, trees that begin to take on stunningly unusual shapes thanks to heavy coatings of ice and snow.\nThe resort even has a winter night cruising vehicle to take guests to the trees at night, when they become illuminated in colorful lights to offer a magnificent display.\nNight Skiing\nFlickr/LucTonnerre\nMany of Niseko's lifts remain open for night skiing and come lit up with extensive lighting for those who want to head to some of the more advanced areas, while extensive floodlit night skiing also abounds in Ishiuchi Maruyama.\nIn Furano, travelers can enjoy night skiing until late March before making their way over to the Kan Kan Murasnow village, located in an illuminated forest, where you'll find an ice cafe and snow sculptures to enjoy.\nThose who night ski on the Kitanomine side of the resort will also find stunning panoramic views of Furano glistening in night lights.\nOff the Slopes\nShutterstock\nWhen it's time to take a break from the slopes, there's plenty of breathtaking winter displays and rare natural phenomenon to explore.\nGet up-close with nature at the Jigokudani Yaen-Koen, where you can see Japanese snow monkeys bathing in hot springs. The monkeys have became famous for their fondness of the hot temperatures and the time they spend bathing in it, making for an adorable sight.\nTry an onsen, a Japanese hot spring, for a great end to a day in the snow. The Nozawa-onsen hot spring village sits at the foot of the Kenashi-yama Mountain, on top of which is the Nozawa-onsen ski resort.\nFans of ice hotels should check out the Shikaribetsu Ko Kotan from January 28 through March 20.
