I'm going to f*****g kill you. You better stay there, I'm going to rip your throat out.'\nMs Irving added: 'She [the defendant] races towards Miss Galley. She pointed her finger into her face, making contact with her face.\n'Miss Galley pushed her hand away. The defendant then grabbed Ms Galley by the throat, pulling her head downwards.\n'Both of the defendant's hands are clasped around her throat. Miss Galley says her breathing is restricted. The defendant then begins to hit the left side of her body off Miss Galley's car.\n'Miss Galley was struggling for breath and putting her arms out to get the defendant to release her.'\nNorth Tyneside Magistrates' Court, pictured, heard Mason threatened to 'rip Miss Galley's throat out' and pulled out her hair and 'banged her against a car'\nThe court heard it was a female resident on the street who eventually came to the victim's rescue and pulled Mason away.\nMs Galley, a healthcare assistant at North Tyneside District Hospital, suffered loss of clumps of hair, bruising around her neck, strained neck muscles and soft tissue damage to her ribs.\nIn a statement read to the court, she said she had suffered from anxiety in the past, which had been improving up until the attack.\nShe said: 'This assault has caused my anxiety to worsen. It is having a continuing impact on my day-to-day life.'\nJack Lovell, defending, said Mason, who has no previous convictions and works as an administrator, had been having issues with people parking in front of her driveway.\nHe said: 'On one occasion, she was late for work because of it.\n'She's shown genuine remorse and is devastated to be 52 years old and come before a court for this.'\nMason was given a 12-month community order and will have to do 100 hours of unpaid work.\nShe was also ordered to pay Â£300 compensation, costs and a victim surcharge.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319674/Road-rage-woman-tried-choke-motorist-outside-home.html"}
