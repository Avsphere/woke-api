But UK Athletics has recognised the widespread loss of confidence in athletics because of a corruption scandal that suggests drugs cheats have been protected by world athletics chiefs at the IAAF – with the corruption allegedly going to the very top with former IAAF president Lamine Diack now among those under investigation by the French authorities for extorting money from athletes to conceal positive tests.\nUnveiled on Monday, UKA’s ‘manifesto for clean athletics’ includes ‘a call to the IAAF to investigate the implications of drawing a line under all pre-existing sport records – for example, by adjusting event rules – and commencing a new set of records based on performances in the new Clean Athletics era’.\nPaula Radcliffe, pictured in London in 2003, could see her women's marathon record wiped out\nJonathan Edwards' triple jump record from 1995 (pictured) could also be wiped out of the history books\nColin Jackson's 60m hurdles record from March 1994 could also be erased if UK Athletics do wipe out results\nGB'S CURRENT RECORD HOLDERS Jonathan Edwards has held the world record in triple jump since 1995. Edwards, now 49, broke the world record twice at the 1995 World Championships. His record still stands at 18.29 metres. Colin Jackson held the world record for 110m hurdles for 10 years before he was eventually gazumped. However the 48-year-old does hold the current indoor world record for 60m hurdles with a time of 7.30 seconds from his March 1994 race in Germany. Paula Radcliffe, 42, is the current women's world record holder in the marathon. Her time of 2 hours, 15 minutes and 25 seconds, which she set during the 2003 London Marathon, ensured her name remains in the record books.\nUKA would also like to see the introduction of a public register of all drugs tests, make national federations pay compensation for athletes cheated out of medals and prize money and hit the most flagrant breaches of doping regulations with lifetime bans.\nThe governing body of British Athletics also plans to announce fresh recommendations from their review into the Nike Oregon Project following allegations of unethical practices by Alberto Salazar, the American coach of double Olympic champion Mo Farah.\nUKA had said they would wait until the conclusion of the United States Anti-Doping Agency’s investigation into the Salazar-run Oregon project, having initially said in September that their own independent investigation had ‘found no reason to be concerned’ despite around 20 witnesses linked to the NOP having given evidence to USADA investigators.\nIt will be interesting to see if that position has changed. In the initial statement issued on Monday morning UKA said: ‘We are also publishing the recommendations from our review into Oregon last summer. We had said we would wait until the USADA Report before publishing but the need for transparency overrides our previously stated position.’\nThe UKA manifesto is certainly ambitious, and could yet spark internal conflict as well as a wider debate given the call to transfer power from national doping agencies like UK Anti-Doping to the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nThe manifesto makes 14 recommendations in all, with UKA stating a desire to explore ‘how to best legally implement a rule that will result in athletes who commit a serious anti-doping violation receiving a lifetime ban from representing Great Britain’.\nThe 14 recommendations are:\n· WADA should maintain a public global register of all drugs tests so that the times and places of tests undertaken by all athletes are open to scrutiny.\n· If the above is not introduced swiftly by WADA, UK Sport should mandate all lottery-funded athletes in Great Britain to have their tests available on a public register maintained by UKAD. Non lottery-funded athletes in the UK should be invited to join the register.\n· A call to WADA and UKAD to investigate the implications of publishing a register of missed tests. Also to review the efficacy of the current ‘three strikes’ system with a view to lengthening the measurement period to 18 months or two years\n· The pool of athletes subject to testing, both in the UK and worldwide, should be deepened. Also, there should be an increase in out-of-competition testing for all athletes.\nEx-IAAF chief Lamine Diack is under investigation by the French authorities for extorting money from athletes\nUK Athletics want to move into a 'clean era' after allegations of unethical practices by Alberto Salazar (centre)\n· WADA should review and strengthen the process around the granting of Therapeutic Use Exemptions to athletes.\n· The IAAF should insist that all athletes competing in world championships have a valid blood/biological passport and have been subject to a predetermined number of in-competition and out-of-competition tests in the 12 months preceding the competition. This should be in place for at least the top 10 leading athletics nations by the 2017 World Championships. Once established this blood/biological passport should become an athlete prerequisite for all major international competitions.\n· The IAAF should make it the responsibility of member federations to reimburse any lost prize monies to affected athletes resulting from a ban and annulment of results. If a member federation does not honour this responsibility, it can be suspended from participating in major championships.\n· A call to the IAAF to investigate the implications of drawing a line under all pre-existing sport records – for example, by adjusting event rules – and commencing a new set of records based on performances in the new Clean Athletics era.\n· A call to all companies who engage in sports sponsorship not to support any athlete found guilty of a serious doping offence as a matter of principle in support of Clean Athletics. In addition we call for the IAAF to ring-fence a percentage of each of its commercial sponsorships to be used toward the funding and support of Clean Athletics.\nUKA have urged sporting organisations such as Nike to end sponsorship with athletes found guilty of doping\n· Governments should commit to ensuring that their national anti-doping agencies are truly independent, ideally by handing over their management directly to WADA.\n· Bans should be extended to a minimum of eight years for serious doping offences to ensure that cheating athletes miss two Olympic or Paralympic cycles. Lifetime bans should also be applied in appropriate cases.\n· The supply or procurement of performance enhancing drugs should be criminalised and those in positions of authority who are found to be involved in such practices should be banned for life from any involvement in sport.\n· Anti-doping agencies should be renamed Clean Sport, or their equivalent in local language – for example Clean Sport UK – to emphasise the ultimate purpose of their activities.\n· Finally, UK Athletics commits to exploring how to best legally implement a rule that will result in athletes who commit a serious anti-doping violation receiving a lifetime ban from representing Great Britain.\nUKA chairman Ed Warner said: ‘The integrity of athletics was challenged as never before in 2015. Clean athletes and sports fans the world over have been let down. Trust in the sport is at its lowest point for decades.\nUK Athletics chairman Ed Warner has called on athletics to 'face up to the scale of the problem'\n‘UKA believes the time has come for radical reform if we are to help restore trust in the sport. Athletics needs to act very differently if we are to move on from the crisis facing the sport. We are publishing today a \"Manifesto for Clean Athletics\". We cannot will the ends - a clean sport that people can trust - if we are not prepared to be bold and put in place the means to get there.\n‘Greater transparency, tougher sanctions, longer bans - and even resetting the clock on world records for a new era - we should be open to do whatever it takes to restore credibility in the sport.\n'And at the heart must be a proper and appropriate funding regime for the anti-doping authorities to help confront the new challenges they face. Clean athletes the world over deserve nothing less.\n‘This Manifesto is obviously just one contribution to the debate. There will doubtless be many others. What matters now is that athletics faces up to the scale of the problem facing the sport and is brave enough to take the tough and radical steps to ensure its long term health - however difficult they may be.\n‘We are also publishing the recommendations from our review into Oregon last summer. We had said we would wait until the USADA Report before publishing but the need for transparency overrides our previously stated position.’","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-3393253/UK-Athletics-proposes-wiping-results-usher-clean-athletics-era-Paula-Radcliffe-Colin-Jackson-Jonathan-Edwards-lose-world-records.html"}
