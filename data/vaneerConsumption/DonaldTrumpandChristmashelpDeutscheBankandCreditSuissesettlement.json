The Swiss bank will also pay $2.8 billion in consumer relief over five years from the settlement, it said in a statement.\nRegulators often clear their decks before the Christmas break but this year is particularly special for the DoJ, which is anticipating a radical change in administration from President Barack Obama to Donald Trump, who has filled his cabinet with Wall Street heavyweights and billionaires.\nDeutsche Bank is trying to restructure $300 million of Donald Trump's debt, according to Bloomberg, which would have raised concerns of a conflict of interest if any deal would have been struck under his administration.\nEither way, drawing a line under the misdeeds of the past has cheered investors.\n\"Deutsche bank shares +3.7% suggests relief at a good result and the affair being closed. Credit Suisse shares flat implies an acceptable deal,\"Mike van Dulken, an analyst at Accendo Markets, said in an emailed statement on Friday. \"However there is no panic.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-and-christmas-help-deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-settlement-2016-12"}
