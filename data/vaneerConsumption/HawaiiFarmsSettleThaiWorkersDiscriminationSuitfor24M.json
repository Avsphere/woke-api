Global Horizons and Maui Pineapple Co., the last farm that hasn't settled, are scheduled to go to trial in November, said Anna Park, EEOC Los Angeles regional attorney, who traveled to Honolulu to announce the settlement details.\nAll of the $3.6 million in settlement funds will go directly to the workers, Park said, in a distribution process that involves determining who worked on the various farms, for how long and the severity of the abuse workers suffered.\nLikhit Yoo-on and Khamjuan Namwichai told reporters through a translator Tuesday about how they were recruited in Thailand to do agricultural work in the United States with promises of earning enough money to support their families.\nTheir passports were taken away. Yoo-on said he had to sleep on the floor and was forced to harvest bananas even when sick. Namwichai said he lived in a bug-infested house where 26 workers shared one bathroom.\nThe contractor sought impoverished Thai nationals, who they stereotyped to be docile and compliant, Park said, and charged them fees ranging from $9,500 to $26,000.\nMordechai Orian, president and chief strategic officer of now-defunct Global Horizons, said by phone Tuesday that he doesn't believe any of the allegations.\n\"We're filing motions and everything to dismiss the case,\" he said. \"It's a baseless case.\"\nAttorneys for the farms couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n-The Associated Press","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/hawaii-farms-settle-thai-workers-discrimination-suit-2-4m-n121846"}
