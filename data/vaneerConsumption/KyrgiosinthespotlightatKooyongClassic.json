It will be imposed if he gets in trouble on court again, something he managed to avoid in Perth.\nThe powerful Kyrgios, who won all four of his singles rubbers at the Hopman Cup and helped team-mate Daria Gavrilova to the first Aussie victory in the event for 16 years, will take to the court on Wednesday when he faces Belgian David Goffin.\n\"My game can always get better. There’s always things I need to improve on. You can never be too ready, I feel, for a Grand Slam,\" world number 30 Kyrgios said as he prepared for the business end of the Australian tennis summer.\n\"I’m nervous, I’m excited. I don’t really know how much or how little to do. I’m just going to get out there and practise a bit more.\n\"I feel like I play my best tennis on big stages. If I’m serving well and playing the right game style, I think I’ve got a good chance.\"\nTuesday's opening programme will feature half of the field on court with the remainder to play Wednesday. As in the past, winners progress while losers complete relegation play.\nOn Tuesday, Frenchman Gilles Simon brings a 2-2 record into an opening match with Spain's Feliciano Lopez as the pair meet for the first time since 2014.\nAustralian Open wildcard Omar Jasika faces South Korea's Hyeon Chung and Nicolas Almagro and Paul Henri Mathieu hold another Spain-French clash.\nThe Wednesday line-up includes former Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis taking on Spanish youngster Pablo Carenno Busta, while German teen Alex Zverev plays Britain's Kyle Edmund in addition to the showcase Kyrgios match.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393431/Kyrgios-spotlight-Kooyong-Classic.html"}
