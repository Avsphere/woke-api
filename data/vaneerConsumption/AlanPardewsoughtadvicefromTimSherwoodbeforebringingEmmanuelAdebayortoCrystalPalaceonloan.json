He didn’t need to come here. The financial deal for him to be here or stay at home is probably the same so he’s putting himself up and that fills me with confidence.\nThe Togo striker joined Crystal Palace on Tuesday after spending five months as a free agent\n‘I’ve had messages from Tim via somebody else but I probably will speak to Tim as I go along. I need to work with Ade for a little bit and then I’d call Tim just to finalise my opinion, that is was right.’\nSpurs are paying around £30,000 of his wages until the summer, with Palace making up the remaining £70,000 but Pardew admits he has further incentivised Adebayor’s contract with add-ons if the striker can prove his fitness and get himself out on the pitch.\nThe former West Ham and Newcastle boss also says it has been a case of ‘third time lucky’ in pursuit of a forward he still rates as one of the best in the business.\n‘We’ve incentivised his contract to be a success here. I see in him a desire to get his career back on track and I think I can help him,’ Pardew admitted.\nAdebayor was released from Spurs after falling out of favour under Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane\n‘So I’m hoping that’s a win-win situation for him and for us. You cannot underestimate quality he has. I’ve tried to sign him twice before.\n‘Once when I was at West Ham – I came that close – and once at Newcastle. We talked long and hard about it. So he’s a player that’s been on my radar for a while and I’m very pleased to have him. ‘I think he’s a character that needs to be loved and with the group, staff and fans we have I think he’s going to get that.\n'We've got one of the best players, in my opinion, that could possibly be got in this window. This is a player that’s played for Arsenal, Monaco, Real Madrid, and Manchester City. This is a very very good player and if I can get him anywhere near his best then that’ll be more than good enough for us.'\nPardew insists he has sufficiently researched Adebayor's character and is confident he can perform at Palace\nSome Palace fans see Adebayor as a risk given his previous fitness problems and off-field issues but Pardew dismissed any concerns.\nHe added: ‘The only risk is if he doesn’t play well. I can’t see any other risk. I look at players and I think we discard players quite quickly and sometimes too early. Harry Redknapp was very good at regenerating senior players who were supposedly at the end of their careers.\n‘Teddy Sheringham was playing in my [West Ham] Premier League team at 38 and sometimes you cannot get the kind of quality that Ade can bring. We’re very fortunate to have him, I make no bones about that. I think our fans should be very optimistic, because I am, and let’s see where the ride takes us.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3421185/Alan-Pardew-sought-advice-Tim-Sherwood-bringing-Emmanuel-Adebayor-Crystal-Palace-loan.html"}
