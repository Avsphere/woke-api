You're not alone.\nEveryone from world-famous businesswoman, Arianna Huffington, to Gwyneth Paltrow, is obsessed with shut-eye - but still, many of us feel that we're not getting enough.\nHere, in advance of World Sleep Day this Friday, FEMAIL spoke to leading Australian sleep expert and co-founder of The Good Night Co, Shea Morrison, who revealed her top sleep tips.\nFrom ditching your PJs to making sure you have sex before you nod off and even doing acupressure on yourself, some of them might surprise you.\nFEMAIL spoke to leading Australian sleep expert and founder of The Good Night Co, Shea Morrison (pictured right), who revealed her top sleep tips\nFrom ditching your PJs to making sure you have sex before you nod off, some of the sleep tips might surprise you (stock image)\nMs Morrison told Daily Mail Australia that the most important thing when it comes to a good night's sleep is priming yourself to go to bed.\n'Don't drink caffeine after 2pm if you know it takes you a while to process it,' she said.\n'You should also get ready for bed an hour early by getting rid of your devices, making a calming, relaxing herbal tea and running a magnesium-filled bath.'\nMs Morrison said it pays to avoid caffeine after 2pm (stock image) - she also said it's a good idea to ban devices an hour before bedtime and have a magnesium bath\nWHAT TO EAT TO HELP YOU SLEEP * Cherries * Bananas * Walnuts * Milk *Herbal tea\nBut Ms Morrison's tips don't only encompass what you might expect.\nThe expert also recommends that you have sex before you go to sleep as it 'can reduce the amount of time it takes to fall asleep and improve overall sleep quality'.\nAnother unusual - but useful - tactic is to ditch your pajamas.\n'Researchers have found that when our bodies can't reach the optimal core temperature for sleep, it causes insomnia and disrupts sleep,' she said.\n'Wearing pajamas can keep the body from reaching this optimal temperature and lead to overheating during the night.'\nAn unusual way to help yourself sleep is to do acupuncture on yourself (stock image) - this can, apparently, help to put you into a zen state so you can get to sleep\n'Researchers have found that when our bodies can't reach the optimal core temperature for sleep, it causes insomnia and disrupts sleep,' Ms Morrison said - you should sleep naked\nFinally, Ms Morrison is a fan of doing acupressure on yourself before bedtime.\n'According to Joy Martina, PhD, and Roy Martina, MD, authors of \"Sleep Your Fat Away\", if you tap lightly on the area above the centre of your lip and beneath the bridge of your nose and breathe deeply for several seconds you'll put yourself into a zen state that can help you sleep.'\nFailing that, try putting your legs up on the wall.\n'The legs-up-on-the-wall pose, known as Viparita Karani, helps to calm your nervous system and quieten your mind so it's easier to fall asleep,' she said.\nNamaste.\nTo find out more about The Good Night Co, click here.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4318852/Expert-reveals-tips-getting-good-night-s-sleep.html"}
