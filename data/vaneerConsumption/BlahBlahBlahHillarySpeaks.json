They have no paperwork, no documentation,\" he said. \"This may be the great Trojan Horse of all time.\" Then he said: \"Every person here who is of a Muslim background\" should be tested to determine whether he or she believes in Shariah, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scriptures.\nIf they do, he said, they should be deported — even if they're U.S. citizens. Gingrich added that anyone who simply visits any website \"favoring ISIS or al Qaeda or other terrorist groups\" should be guilty of a felony, \"and they should go to jail.\" Strong stuff indeed but close to the sentiments with which many millions of Americans agree at this moment in time. Yes, a religious test is a violation of the Constitution but let's give Newt a pass. Eighty-four people, ten of them children, had just been mowed down by an agent of ISIS, that JayVee team Obama so likes to belittle, that seventh-century gang of thugs that believes paradise awaits when and if they slaughter a sufficient number of innocent infidels. The more, the better. Then Hillary weighed in with her usual blather. She did connect the words \"radical jihadism,\" a slip of the tongue if there ever were one. She did not mention Islam! She began every sentence with \"Well....\" Of course. Beyond that she did the Obama thing -- long pauses between words and phrases, being careful that she did not offend anyone on any side of any ideological spectrum. The woman is a coward of the first order. \"We need an \"intelligence surge!\" What the hell is that? It is meaningless from the woman whose husband, with Jamie Gorelick, saw to it that under his administration no agency could share information with another; the FBI could not share with the CIA. That produced the lack of \"intelligence\" that brought 9/11 upon us. Because the weapon of choice in Nice was not a gun, she could not fall back on her usual gun control meme. So she babbled: blah, blah, blah. No other person can talk for so long and say absolutely nothing. The woman is without a soul, wholly without character. Like Obama, she denies that Islam has anything to do with the gruesome attacks that have taken place in Paris, Brussels, Bangladesh, San Bernardino, Orlando, Istanbul, Iraq, or Nice. She knows better of course but does not want to offend anyone whose vote or money she seeks. She promises to import more refugees from Syria in her first hundred days, along with amnesty for all who are already here illegally. If she reads the reports of violence plaguing Germany, Sweden, Norway, France, Italy, etc., she is ignoring the obvious: many of these people are violent, inassimilable criminals and she means to foist them upon Americans throughout the country who do not have armed security guards or live in gated communities and whom she intends to deprive of their Second Amendment rights. \"We have to stand with France, with NATO,\" she says. We have done nothing of the kind under Obama's leadership from behind. Instead, the Middle East has been handed over to the seventh century barbarians who are murdering their way across the Middle East and now Europe and the US. Obama has encouraged those nations to embrace those millions of refugees among whom the terrorists are hiding, seething with anger, ripe for recruitment by ISIS. These facts aside, Hillary wants more diplomacy, more talk. She is the enemy of peace and national security. She does not want to take out ISIS in Raqqa! No troops. She is wrong about the Turks \"helping\" as well. She has not a clue, nor does she care, about stopping terrorism. She is in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood via Huma Abedin. Hillary cares only about money and power. This woman must never again get close to the White House. She is a short-sighted politician, the opposite of what we need. She will get many of us, if not all of us, killed.","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/07/blah_blah_blahhillary_speaks.html"}
