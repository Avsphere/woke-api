The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nARLINGTON, Texas - When it comes to cow-milking contests, Cleveland Indians catcher George Kottaras is udderly dominant.\nKottaras beat Rangers reliever Robbie Ross on Saturday for the second straight year as the Texas team recognized the state's dairy farmers before the game. The event was held in foul territory down the left-field line, and Ross got off to a good start. But then his cow kicked over the bucket and his early lead trickled away.\nRoss was crying over the spilt milk.\n\"I cannot believe that happened,\" he said. \"I was cruising, too.\"\nKottaras had never milked a cow before last year, when he came through Arlington while with the Kansas City Royals. He said he hadn't done any milking since last year's win.\n\"It wasn't the way I wanted, but I'll take it,\" he said after his latest victory.\nThe Indians went on to dominate on the field, too, defeating the Rangers 8-3.\nâ€” The Associated Press","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/baseball-stars-face-cow-milking-contest-n125571"}
