Revenues jumped 19 percent to 5.5 billion.\nCredit Suisse cited a surge in its wealth management business that took in 12 billion francs in net new assets, a 24-percent increase from the previous year.\nChairman Urs Rohner said Credit Suisse opted for the share issue instead of a partial initial public offering of its Swiss operations, saying it was expected to underpin growth and help complete ongoing restructuring.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4446510/Credit-Suisse-raise-4B-share-issue-1Q-reaps-profit.html"}
