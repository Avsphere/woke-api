This club will always hold a special place for me. 2/3 — Aitor Karanka (@Karanka) March 16, 2017\nI wish everyone connected with Middlesbrough Football Club the very best for the future. Up The Boro! 3/3 — Aitor Karanka (@Karanka) March 16, 2017\nIt was his latest incendiary remark – he has criticised both the fans and the club’s January recruitment drive in recent months – and with Gibson having funded both Downing’s return and Bamford’s permanent capture at great expense, did not go down particularly well.\nKaranka’s comments were also symptomatic of a greater malaise with his stubborn refusal to accept that his Plan A was no longer working as well as the lack of a workable Plan B contributing to a run of 10 league games without a win and only three goals scored.\nThe club looked to be heading in only one direction and after having to wait eight years to return to the top flight after relegation in 2009, Gibson decided that enough was enough.\nAitor Karanka\nKaranka’s exit was announced in a brief statement which read: “Middlesbrough Football Club can today confirm the departure of head coach Aitor Karanka. Following discussions, both parties have agreed that it is in the best interests of the club to make this change.\n“The club would like to thank Aitor for all his hard work over the past three and a half years and for the success we’ve had during that time. We wish him all the best for the future.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4319708/Middlesbrough-confirm-Aitor-Karanka-exit-following-poor-run-results.html"}
