I know some would argue that it's all thanks to loads of makeup (which is partially true), but I've seen the 33 year old walk the red carpet before, and it was very clear: Girl had some really, really good skin as the base of all that foundation. It makes sense, though. She's besties with her dermatologist, has a full-time, devoted glamsquad and incredibly good genes (minus all that Botox, Kris Jenner is one hot lady). So when Kim Kardashian talks beauty, I'm all ears. Recently, momager Jenner uploaded this clip from Keeping Up with the Kardashians on her Instagram revealing favorite daughter Kim's quick and easy anti-aging secret.\nWhat's the big mystery? High. Ponytails. In the clip, Kim Kardashian walks in on Khloe, asking her if she looks like \"old Kim circa Super Bowl,\" referring to this Sketchers Shape-Ups commercial. Khloe answers, \"Yeah, and I love it.\" Kim then shares how she achieved beauty time-travel: \"Cause it's the ponytail. It snatches your face up.\" That's it, ladies. That's how Kim Kardashian keeps her face so flawless and tight. A supersleek, high ponytail. The only problem? \"It hurts a little bit,\" she tells Khloe. Beauty is pain!\nTo further prove how firm and flawless Kim Kardashian's skin looks when she wears a high pony, I present you with nine photos of her utilizing her trusty beauty hack.\n1.
