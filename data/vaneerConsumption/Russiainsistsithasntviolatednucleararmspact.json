Paul Selva, vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, has accused Russia of deploying a land-based cruise missile in violation of \"the spirit and intent\" of the treaty. He said that Moscow's intention is to threaten U.S. facilities in Europe and the NATO alliance.\nZakharova criticized what she described as \"unfounded rhetoric\" by the U.S. She added that Russia also has seen some U.S. actions as violations of the pact, and called for a constructive review of mutual complaints.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4301272/Russia-insists-violated-nuclear-arms-pact.html"}
