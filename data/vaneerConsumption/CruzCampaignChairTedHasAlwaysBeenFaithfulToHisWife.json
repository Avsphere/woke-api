Ted Cruz (R-TX) of having extramarital affairs with five different women, Cruz campaign chairman Chad Sweet declared that Cruz “has been faithful to his wife.”\nPartial transcript as follows:\nTAPPER: I want to ask you about this horrific tabloid trash, this “National Enquirer” story which the Trump campaign has been pushing out there. One uncomfortable point that critics point out, critics of Mr. Cruz, is that while Senator Cruz has called the story garbage, he’s never unequivocally denied being unfaithful to his wife, Heidi. He was asked directly by a “Daily Mail” reporter “Have you ever been unfaithful?” and he wouldn’t answer or didn’t answer the question. Obviously this is a disgusting topic and an intrusion on his privacy, but the Trump campaign is making hay out of it. I can say I’ve never been unfaithful to my wife, period. Can Senator Cruz say that too?\nSWEET: He can say that. Let me tell you, I’m a personal friend of the senator’s. My wife, Julie, and I have known Heidi and Ted for years. They’re godparents to my daughters. He’s an incredibly devoted and faithful husband and father. I want to be absolutely crystal clear about this. He made it clear that the accusations are garbage and lies, absolutely false, and he wants me to convey this unequivocally as well, that he has been faithful to his wife. There’s no doubt about that. If there’s any confusion about that, let me settle that right here right now.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/30/cruz-campaign-chair-cruz-always-faithful-wife/"}
