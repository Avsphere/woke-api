The inflation rate now stands at 1.8 percent.\nHoward Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, says the bank \"will remain pretty tolerant on the inflation overshoot given the prolonged, highly uncertain outlook that the U.K. economy is likely to face as the government negotiates the exit from the EU.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319964/Bank-England-keeps-rates-low-amid-Brexit-uncertainty.html"}
