A pair of bioethicists made the shocking prediction in a new paper in which they propose new human rights laws to prepare for advances in brain technology (stock image)\nWHAT RISKS WILL TECHNOLOGY BRING? The authors explain that as 'neurotechnology' improves and becomes commonplace, there is a risk that the technology could be hacked. This could allow a third-party to 'eavesdrop' on someone's mind. In the future, a brain-computer interface used to control consumer technology could put the user at risk of physical and psychological damage caused by a third-party attack on the technology. There are also ethical and legal concerns over the protection of data generated by these devices that need to be considered. International human rights laws make no specific mention to neuroscience, although advances in biomedicine have become intertwined with laws, such as those concerning human genetic data.\nThe researchers made the shocking predictions in a new paper in which they propose new human rights laws to prepare for advances in brain technology.\nNew laws are needed to protect humans from having their 'freedom of the mind' taken from them, the researchers said.\nThey warned that the advance of 'neurotechnology' could one day breach our privacy of thought.\nThe authors of the study suggest four new human rights laws could emerge in the near future to protect against exploitation.\nThe four laws are: The right to cognitive liberty, the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity and the right to psychological continuity.\nMarcello Ienca, lead author and PhD student at the Institute for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Basel, said: 'The mind is considered to be the last refuge of personal freedom and self-determination, but advances in neural engineering, brain imaging and neurotechnology put the freedom of the mind at risk.\n'Our proposed laws would give people the right to refuse coercive and invasive neurotechnology, protect the privacy of data collected by neurotechnology, and protect the physical and psychological aspects of the mind from damage by the misuse of neurotechnology.'\nAdvances in neurotechnology, such as sophisticated brain imaging and the development of brain-computer interfaces, have led to these technologies moving away from a clinical setting and into the consumer domain.\nWhile these advances may be beneficial for individuals and society, there is a risk that the technology could be misused.\nThis could create unprecedented threats to our personal freedom, the researchers said.\nNew laws are needed to protect humans from having their 'freedom of the mind' taken from them, the researchers said. They warned that the advance of technology to predict speech and behaviour patterns could one day breach our 'privacy of thought' (stock image)\nProfessor Roberto Andorno, co-author of the research, explained: 'Brain imaging technology has already reached a point where there is discussion over its legitimacy in criminal court, for example as a tool for assessing criminal responsibility or even the risk of re-offending.\n'Consumer companies are using brain imaging for \"neuromarketing\", to understand consumer behaviour and elicit desired responses from customers.\n'There are also tools such as \"brain decoders\" which can turn brain imaging data into images, text or sound.\n'All of these could pose a threat to personal freedom which we sought to address with the development of four new human rights laws.'\nThe authors explain that as 'neurotechnology' improves and becomes commonplace, there is a risk that the technology could be hacked.\nThis could allow a third-party to 'eavesdrop' on someone's mind.\nIn the future, a brain-computer interface used to control consumer technology could put the user at risk of physical and psychological damage caused by a third-party attack on the technology.\nThere are also ethical and legal concerns over the protection of data generated by these devices that need to be considered.\n'We suggest that in response to emerging neurotechnology possibilities, the right to mental integrity should not exclusively guarantee protection from mental illness or traumatic injury but also from unauthorised intrusions into a person’s mental wellbeing performed through the use of neurotechnology, especially if such intrusions result in physical or mental harm to the neurotechnology user,' the ethicists wrote.\n'The right to mental privacy is a neuro-specific privacy right which protects private or sensitive information in a person’s mind from unauthorised collection, storage, use, or even deletion in digital form or otherwise.'\nInternational human rights laws make no specific mention to neuroscience, although advances in biomedicine have become intertwined with laws, such as those concerning human genetic data.\nAs with the 'genetic revolution', the authors state that the ongoing neurorevolution will force a rehash of human rights laws and even the creation of new ones.\nMr Ienca added: 'Science-fiction can teach us a lot about the potential threat of technology.\n'Neurotechnology featured in famous stories has in some cases already become a reality, while others are inching ever closer, or exist as military and commercial prototypes.\n'We need to be prepared to deal with the impact these technologies will have on our personal freedom.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4447778/Computers-future-delete-steal-thoughts.html"}
