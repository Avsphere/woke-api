'Normally when we go there, it is for a shoplifter, but not anything like this.'\nPolice are now trying to track down the owner of the cooler by looking through CCTV footage but staff are not sure at which location the cooler was donated.\nGoodwill say that is it common to receive strange donations such as forgotten money left in the pockets of clothes, but not 60 ounces of marijuana.\n'This is a reminder to check your purse, pockets, or cooler to make sure you're donating the items you mean to,' Katherine Boury, a spokesperson for Goodwill said to CNN.\nThe bags contained 60 ounces of weed. Police are now looking through CCTV footage to see who it was that dropped off the cooler along with the stash of hash\nMs. Boury said that she has encountered even stranger donations during her time with the charity.\n'In 2013, three human skulls were found,' she said. 'Two had been used for medical research, and one Native American skull was more than 100 years old.\n'We worked with authorities to track down the origin of the Native American skull for proper burial.'\nAs for the marijuana, Goodwill say that all of it will be burned in the coming weeks.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4320048/5-bags-pot-inside-cooler-donated-Goodwill.html"}
