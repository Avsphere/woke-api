This year, with hundreds of millions of dollars rolling into initiative campaigns over housing and health care, California has hit a new record.\nThe $111 million campaign against Proposition 8 on kidney dialysis clinics amounts to the most money poured into a single side of a ballot measure in the United States—at least since electronic record-keeping began in 2002, and possibly ever.\nHere are three industries spending huge sums to influence your vote:\nLandlords and real estate agents outraising rent-control advocates 3-to-1\nLandlords are largely bankrolling the campaign against Proposition 10, which would allow local governments to expand rent control.\n“They don’t want to see their property values decline, it’s that simple,” said Steve Maviglio, spokesman for the No on Prop. 10 campaign, which has raised $74.7 million.\nProp. 10 would repeal a 1995 state law that forbids cities from applying rent control to single-family houses, or any type of home built after 1995, and allows landlords to raise apartment rent any time a tenant moves out. Instead the ballot measure would give cities the option to expand rent control to cover more homes—making it harder for landlords to turn a profit.\n“It’s about their future, their bottom line. That’s why they’re spending so much,” said Charly Norton, spokeswoman for the Yes on prop. 10 campaign, which has raised $25.9 million, mostly from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\nSupporters say Prop. 10 is necessary because homelessness is on the rise and a growing share of Californians spend more than half their income on rent. Opponents say it will worsen the state’s housing shortage by discouraging developers from building more homes.\nDonors against Prop. 10 include corporate property owners like Blackstone, Essex and Equity Residential, as well as many individual landlords. The biggest donor is the California Association of Realtors, which has given $8 million to the campaign.\nThe Realtors association also has poured $13.2 million into the campaign for Proposition 5, making it the sole funder of that push to change California’s property tax law.\nCalifornians now generally pay much higher property taxes if they buy a new home after selling a house they’ve owned for many years. That’s because property taxes are based on the sales price of a house, not how much it’s worth as it appreciates over time.\nThis initiative would allow three categories of homeowners—those over 55, disabled or who lost their homes in natural disasters—would keep the property tax levels of the home they sold if they buy a new home.\nReal estate agents say it would encourage older Californians to sell their homes, making more houses available in our tight market. (Experts disagree.) Of course, it also would boost their commissions.\n“It will give a huge windfall to the real estate industry,” said Mike Roth, spokesman for the campaign against Prop. 5, which has raised about $3.2 million, largely from public employee unions that could see cuts if the government loses tax revenue.\nSteve White, president of the California Association of Realtors, insisted it’s about “meeting a need. The unaffordability of housing in California…is largely dictated by lack of availability,” he said. “We have tens of thousands of homes that could be waiting for all those tens of thousands of younger families.”\nDialysis clinics outraising labor opponents 5-to-1\nThe most expensive fight on the California ballot this year is over Proposition 8, which would limit profits for dialysis companies. The businesses are fighting back, pouring $111 million into the campaign against Prop. 8—most of it from two dialysis companies, DaVita and Fresenius.\n“Prop. 8 was designed to have a negative impact on dialysis clinics in California, and that’s why the groups that are opposed are fighting it so heavily,” said Kathy Fairbanks, spokeswoman for the No Prop. 8 campaign.\nShe said the measure wouldn’t allow dialysis clinics to be reimbursed by insurance companies for many routine business expenses. Ultimately, that would cause companies to close clinics, Fairbanks said, giving patients fewer places to seek treatment.\nWorkers at dialysis clinics are not unionized. A labor group that represents other health care workers has had its sights on organizing dialysis workers, and put Prop. 8 on the ballot as part of a much larger feud within the industry.\n“This record amount of (campaign) spending speaks to the priorities of the dialysis corporations which is to protect their profits,” said Sean Wherley, spokesman Service Employees International Union – United Healthcare Workers, the sponsor of Prop. 8.\nThe Prop. 8 campaign has raised $20.3 million, most of it from SEIU United Healthcare Workers. The union argues that dialysis clinic companies are netting huge profits while allowing shoddy health and safety conditions at some clinics. Limiting the companies’ profits to 15 percent, as Prop. 8 calls for, would encourage the clinics to put more money into improving patient care, the union argues.\nAmbulance companies outraising labor opponents more than 600-to-1\nColorado-based company American Medical Response put Proposition 11 on the ballot and contributed most of the $29.9 million raised to support it. The measure would allow private ambulance companies to require workers to remain on-call during breaks, so they can respond to an emergency even if it comes while they’re eating lunch. That’s already the common practice, but this measure comes in response to a court ruling that security guards cannot be required to stay on-call while they’re on breaks. Ambulance companies don’t want to be held to the same standard.\n“If applied to the ambulance industry, it would have a significant public safety risk,” said Marie Brichetto, spokeswoman for the Yes on Prop. 11 campaign.\nOpponents, the emergency responders who work on ambulances, aren’t raising much money—the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees union contributed just $47,000 to oppose Prop. 11.\n“This is a classic ‘big corporation against its own employees,’” said Jason Brollini, president of the United EMS Workers union that is affiliated with AFSCME.\nHe contends the ambulance companies’ real motive with Prop. 11 is to eliminate any liability they could face from employees who sue over not getting the extra pay they’re supposed to receive when their breaks are interrupted by an emergency call.","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/trump_california/29148/"}
er in the country, with 73 million people enrolled, mostly low-income or disabled. In California, 13.5 million people are on Medi-Cal, or roughly one in three Californians. The program grew by 3.6 million people when it was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.\nA study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the proposals to reorganize Medicaid funding would decrease funding by one-third to one-half within a decade.\nSuch federal cuts would trigger a cascade of effects, said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles).\n“If the Trump administration decides to remove and take away access to quality healthcare that could possibly drive a budget deficit—and if you drive a budget deficit that means cuts would have to be made,” he said at a health care rally in Los Angeles after the November election. “If cuts have to be made that means other people could be hurt.”\nBut others aren’t ready to concede that outcome and say there are likely alternatives the state can employ to keep as many people covered as possible.\n“The reality is if Congress has enough votes to change the Medicaid program into a block grant program, California will struggle to maintain its commitment to the 13.5 million people currently covered,” said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. “I suspect the governor and Legislature will give higher priority to cutting covered services rather than cutting the number of beneficiaries.”\nSen. Lara said he hopes the state resists choosing one group over another—adding that he plans to suggest cutting coverage, as the state has done during lean times, or increasing eligibility thresholds in his fight to keep health care for the neediest across all groups, including undocumented children.\nAs for 9-year-old Edwin, he says going to the doctor more often is good for him because of his hearing challenges and ear tubes.\n“My friends talk to me and I’m like ‘what, what,’ because I can’t hear them that good,” he said. “Same with my mom, she tells me something and I don’t really hear her and I don’t do the stuff she tells me because I can’t hear. So it’s better, I can hear her and I’m not getting in more trouble.”\nIf kids like Edwin lose Medi-Cal overage, their health care will depend largely on where they live.\nIn Los Angeles, the county offers a basic low-cost program to everyone regardless of immigration status and emergency Medi-Cal is expected to still be available. Private insurer Kaiser Permanente also offers a community benefit program for kids without legal status who live near their facilities.\n“It’s going to be a challenge for us and the patients,” said Chona de Leon, interim chief operating officer at Eisner Health in downtown Los Angeles, where Edwin has received care since he was a baby.\nClinics like Eisner would lose the increased funding that has come from previously uninsured patients getting access through the Affordable Care Act. de Leon says they would continue to serve uninsured patients as always, although they would have to work hard to find outside funding and donations.\nBut in 11 California counties, including Orange and San Diego, there are no programs for undocumented families to find care for their children outside of charitable clinics and hospital emergency rooms.","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/californias-undocumented-kidswhy-they-could-be-first-to-lose-medical-care-under-trump/"}
