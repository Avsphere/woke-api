She said: 'Thirteen years. I don't know how to take that. Does my Dad deserve more?'\nSpeaking about her father's death, she added: ' I was thinking, what was going through your mind?\n'Why couldn't you have just easily stepped out? Go for a walk or something? You didn't have to hurt him.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319800/Pregnant-children-s-author-28-killed-roommate-money.html"}
