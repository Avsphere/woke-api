After a liveable pod has been printed, it would then be slotted into the building's frame using mobile cranes and mechanical arms - also permanent fixtures of the building. The pods contained in the building would feature basic amenities and be available for both residential and commercial use.\nAfter a liveable pod has been printed, it would then be slotted into the building's frame using mobile cranes and mechanical arms - also permanent fixtures of the building.\nThe conceptual designs for the building, dubbed 'Pod Vending Machine,' were created by Haseef Rafiei, an architecture student at the University of Manchester.\nHaving visited Japan a few years back, Mr Rafiei, 25, became inspired by how automated systems could make such a difference to living culture.\nHe said: 'The term \"vending machine\" is used as a metaphor to represent a machine that dispenses necessities gradually according to demand.\n'It would be an interesting thought to have buildings that behave the same way.'\nThe pods contained in the building would feature basic amenities and be available for both residential and commercial use.\nThe pod skyscraper, which has been proposed for Tokyo, is a huge structure that would accommodate a giant 3D printer to create modular homes on-site\nAfter a liveable pod has been printed, it would then be slotted into the building's frame using mobile cranes and mechanical arms - also permanent fixtures of the building\nThe pods contained in the building would feature basic amenities and be available for both residential and commercial use\nAs well as being assembled within the building's ground, the pods would also be disassembled, if a resident leaves, stored and re-used, Mr Rafiei said.\nHaving such a system in place would allow the megastructure to constantly adapt to meet a city's housing demands.\nAs well as being assembled within the building's ground, the pods would also be disassembled, if a resident leaves, stored and re-used\nThe conceptual designs for the building, dubbed 'Pod Vending Machine,' were created by Haseef Rafiei, an architecture student at the University of Manchester\nMr Rafiei, who is from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said: 'The high-precision construction method of 3D printing would significantly reduce the amount of labour, time, costs and material waste.\n'There is also a growing population that are lacking adequate housing.\n'I think that the robotic construction of homes would be the sensible solution to address the growing demands of the housing market.'\nAs more pods are created and placed into the skyscraper, the entire building would become taller.
