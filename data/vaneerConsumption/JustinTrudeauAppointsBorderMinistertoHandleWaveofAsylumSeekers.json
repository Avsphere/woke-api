This week the opposition Conservatives and NDP demanded an emergency study of the government’s response,” Reuters reports. Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government has criticized Trudeau’s lack of leadership on Canada’s irregular immigration, accusing the embattled leader of encouraging “illegal border crossers to come into our country.”\nFord’s spokesman Simon Jefferies said in a statement that Trudeau’s failed border security policies “resulted in a housing crisis, and threats to the services that Ontario families depend on. This mess was 100 per cent the result of the federal government, and the federal government should foot 100 per cent of the bills,” the statement continued.\nThe move to appoint Blair follows Trudeau’s criticism of President Trump’s “zero-tolerance,” policy, causing child migrants to be separated from illegal border-crossing adults. Trudeau told the press he believes the separation of immigrant children from their families by U.S. border agents is “wrong.”\n\"What's going on in the United States is wrong.

Obviously, this is not the way we do things in Canada,” Trudeau said. Shortly after Trudeau’s remarks, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) was seemingly caught changing its headline on a report exploring Canada’s detention of migrants.\n👉CBC headline this morning: Canada also detains migrant children, sometimes for months at a time 👉Later Trudeau opens his mouth: This is not how we do things in Canada 👉What happens then?

Some minors were found left “idle, sleeping or lying on the couches for long periods during the day,” and some experienced “psychiatric and academic difficulties long after detention,” according to a McGill University study.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/07/18/justin-trudeau-border-minister-asylum-seekers/"}
