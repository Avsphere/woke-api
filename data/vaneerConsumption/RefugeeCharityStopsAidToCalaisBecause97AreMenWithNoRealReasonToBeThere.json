I think we need to find other places. These people come from certain countries, which are safe, everything is there, they can work, but I don’t know why they came here.\nThe British public has been enthusiastically giving to the “refugees” in Calais since the story first entered the media, including 700 planning to ride there on bikes in single weekend.\nHowever, tons good were being wasted and left in mud, and at the begging of September charities pleaded for people to stop sending goods as they were “overwhelmed,” asking for money and mobile phones instead.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/10/08/refugee-charity-stops-aid-to-calais-because-97-are-men-with-no-real-reason-to-be-there/"}
