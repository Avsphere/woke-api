Listen I love ‘The View,’ I have been a long time Whoopi fan. Joy Behar is one of the funniest people on TV, but come on? Double standard much? First people jump on Trump for his comments in Rolling Stone about Fiorina face. He followed up at the debate saying she was beautiful. Which by the way a lot of ladies didn’t like either. Why do we have to talk about her looks, because she’s a woman? All this yapping about appearance and then “The View” today, all I’m saying is we women can be the worst to one another. We say don’t talk about their looks. Look what happens. I know these ladies on “The View” get called out too. This is part of the job. I get it. Signed up for, but still we can do better than that.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/29/cnns-baldwin-angered-by-the-views-double-standard-on-fiorinas-looks/"}
