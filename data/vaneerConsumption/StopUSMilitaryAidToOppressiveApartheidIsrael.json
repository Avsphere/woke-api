I would go to Israel—and to Saudi Arabia—with all humility, because nobody has been a bigger violator of these rights and values than our own country,” she said.\nIn tweets, she accused Israel of “the pillage of Palestine” and posted that Israel’s “war crimes & human rights violations are off the charts.”\nCurrently polling at 5%, Stein needs to garner 15% support in election polls in order to qualify for the presidential debates.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/08/09/green-party-presidential-candidate-stop-u-s-military-aid-to-oppressive-apartheid-israel/"}
