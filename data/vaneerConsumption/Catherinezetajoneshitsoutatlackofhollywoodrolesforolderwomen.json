But when we say diversity, let's mean diversity for actors with ethnic differences, age differences, and sex differences.\n\"I don't think I'm going to change a demographic - all I want to do is to do good film that is accessible to people of all ages and races,\" the Oscar-winner stated.\nZeta-Jones also touched on the current Oscars race row sparked by the absence of nominations for black and minority ethnic (BAME) actors.\n\"Regarding the diversity issues that are sweeping Hollywood at the moment, I still find it sad that we're even discussing this at this time. But in the defence of the Academy Oscar voters, they can only vote on what they see,\" she said.\n\"Let's go back to the writers, to the filmmakers and more importantly the studios who finance movies, to get them to have projects where at least diversity has a chance.\"\nThe Swansea-born actress, who has been married to fellow Academy Award winner Michael Douglas since 2000, is busy promoting the big screen version of long-running BBC One sitcom Dad's Army.\nThe Second World War-set series ran from 1968-77 and featured Ian Lavender, who makes a cameo appearance in the new incarnation which stars Toby Jones and sees Zeta-Jones as journalist Rose Winters.\nDuring the webchat, she recalled Dad's Army as \"a childhood favourite\" and talked of \"great memories\" watching with her family.\n\"I am a huge fan of classic British TV and comedy. I feel honoured that the show that really launched me in the UK, The Darling Buds Of May, is now part of that group - with re-runs constantly on television, and a new generation of fans of the show.\"\nThe ITV favourite premiered in 1991 and centred around the Larkins, a large family headed by \"Pop\" Larkin, played by David Jason, and featuring Pam Ferris as \"Ma\" Larkin.\nSet in rural Kent in the 1950s, Zeta-Jones stood out as their alluring daughter Mariette.\nShe made the transition from television to mainstream Hollywood movies following her eye-catching appearance in 1998's The Mask of Zorro with Antonio Banderas.\nTwo years later, Zeta-Jones was acclaimed for her performance in Steven Soderbergh's Oscar-winning film Traffic and won her own Academy Award for her role as Velma Kelly in the 2002 film adaptation of musical Chicago.\n\"I think I am most proud of my work in Chicago and in Traffic. Firstly, because they are so very different and as an actor that's what I always strive to do each time,\" she said.\nNew York-based Zeta-Jones expanded on her love of musicals and her hopes of treading the boards again soon.\n\"I'm looking to go back to Broadway in the near future to do a straight play, something I have never done before. I am very excited about that prospect,\" she enthused.\nDespite the years away living and working in America, Zeta-Jones has not forgotten her roots.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3421125/Catherine-Zeta-Jones-hits-lack-Hollywood-roles-older-women.html"}
