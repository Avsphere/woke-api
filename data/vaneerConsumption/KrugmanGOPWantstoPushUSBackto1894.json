Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), economist and columnist for The New York Times, Paul Krugman, while discussing the U.S. Supreme Court’s “Hobby Lobby” decision, said the Republican Party’s “real goal is to push us back to 1894.”\n“The deep roots of what’s really going on in our political system are much bigger and much scarier,” Krugman said. “Not that long ago when Republicans were riding high, when conservatism was riding really high, Grover Norquist said ‘I don’t want to roll back the New Deal, I want to roll back the Progressive Movement.’ Their real goal is to push us back to 1894, not even to 1924. So these are the stakes. This is really serious stuff.”\nWarren agreed, saying “You talk about rolling back the progressive movement, your exactly right on what Norquist wants to do.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/09/05/krugman-gop-wants-to-push-us-back-to-1894/"}
