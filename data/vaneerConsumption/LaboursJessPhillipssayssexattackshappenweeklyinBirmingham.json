In Cologne (above), more than 800 women claimed they were sexually assaulted or robbed by mobs of young men\nClubs: Broad Street is a popular nightspot in Birmingham and home to numerous bars, restaurants and clubs\nMany are now calling for her to issue an apology to Birmingham and its people - with some even insisting she stand down.\nJohn Williams tweeted the MP directly, saying: 'Are you going to apologise to the men of Brum?\n'How can you liken the Cologne attacks on 820+ women to a Sat night on Broad St (sic)?'\nReaction: Birmingham-based engineer Simon Caswell tweeted: 'Shocking statement from Jess Phillips claiming the attacks in Cologne could be described on Broad St every week. Hurts as a Brummie'\nBlasted: Her remarks prompted a furious response on Twitter from viewers of the BBC One show last night\nImpact: Roy Swales commented that the MP's remarks could have a disastrous effect on local business\nThat view was echoed by Jayne Tuzzio, who tweeted: 'You have lost the plot. How dare you describe Birmingham that way?'\nSteve Lilley posted: 'So, hordes of men batter and rape women on Broad St, Birmingham, every weekend according to Labour's Jess Phillips. Flabbergasted.'\nTwitter user @Copo1966 describe the MP as 'a disgrace', demanding she 'resign now'.\nLeft wingers: Mrs Phillips, pictured with former Labour leader Ed Miliband in London last July, hit the headlines last year when she called in police after receiving a series of disgusting rape threats\nAnd Birmingham-based engineer Simon Caswell tweeted: 'Shocking statement from Jess Phillips claiming the attacks in Cologne could be described on Broad St every week.

A picture of a man touching a woman's bottom has a big cross through it.\nSince the attacks, Germany has seen sales of pepper spray and gas-powered pistols in spiking. Shopkeepers reported scores of concerned women purchasing weapons for self-defence.\nOn Monday an aid worker Alexandra Mezher, 22, was knifed to death at the child migrant centre where she worked in Molndal, Sweden.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422133/Cologne-style-sex-attacks-happen-weekly-Birmingham-Labour-MP-says-women-baited-heckled-weekend-city-centre.html"}
