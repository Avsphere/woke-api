The district already had been listed as “Accredited on Advisement,” one step beneath unconditional accreditation.\nAfter a December 2013 visit, the district’s accreditation was boosted to “Accredited Warned.” A visit in December 2014 moved it up to “Accredited on Advisement.”","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/superintendent-dekalb-schools-regains-full-accreditation-status/9OkyPZqKUHuf9DS4PsfDkP/"}
