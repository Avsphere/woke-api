Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan were expected to offer the measure Thursday as an amendment to a Senate energy bill.\nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chair Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is surrounded by reporters as the Senate moves to rewrite federal energy policies, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2016.
