Under the deal, the companies can't claim that used vehicles are safe unless recall repairs are made or recalls are disclosed. They also have to notify people who bought used cars with open recalls after July 1, 2013.\nGM says it changed its certified used car marketing last year to address FTC concerns.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421722/Feds-settle-used-car-safety-complaints-GM-2-dealers.html"}
