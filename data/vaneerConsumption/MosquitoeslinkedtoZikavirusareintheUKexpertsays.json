The news comes as airlines, hotels and cruise operators serving Latin America and the Caribbean facing growing concerns among travellers regarding the mosquito-borne virus.\nAmerican Airlines tweeted to one concerned traveler, whose wife is pregnant, that it is currently refunding tickets to cities in El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Guatemala. But some Twitter users lamented their ruined vacations and their inability to get a refund from tourism operators.\nZIKA VIRUS: WHAT IS IT AND HOW CAN IT BE PREVENTED? The Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito (inset), which is also known to carry yellow fever. The terrifying virus has now started to spread across the Americas How it spreads: Zika virus is spread to people via mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivtis. Infected patients are typically ill for a few days to a week. While the illness is generally mild, some experts in Brazil have suggested a possible link between the virus in pregnant women and subsequent birth defects. The CDC said recently it is aware of reports of increased numbers of babies born with microcephaly, or smaller than expected head size, in Brazil. The Ministry of Health in Brazil is concerned about a possible association between the Zika virus and increased numbers of babies born with microcephaly. How to prevent it: There is no vaccine to prevent, or medicine to treat Zika virus. Travellers can protect themselves by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites, such as using a mosquito net and wearing insect repellent. Pregnant women are being warned to avoid travelling to 22 countries were outbreaks have been reported. Source: CDC\nStu Privett, an HR systems specialist for the Royal College of Nursing in London, tweeted about cancelling a trip to Barbados with his wife, who is in her first trimester. Privett said he was unable to get a refund from Virgin Holidays.\n'They basically said it was our choice not to go on the holiday,' Privett told Reuters. 'Basically (it's) a case of 'we just lose all the money we've spent.' A Virgin Holidays spokesperson said the company would look into the claim. The National Travel Health Network and Centre also urges rethinks on trips to the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Colombia, Guadeloupe, Panama, Guyana, Suriname, Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, Martinique, French Guiana, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Barbados, Puerto Rico and Haiti.\nZika symptoms are similar to flu including fever, joint pain, rash, headache and muscle pain. However, many people show no signs.\nIt's only in the past few months there's been evidence to link infection in pregnancy and birth defects, microcephaly (a small head).","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3420180/Mosquitoes-linked-baby-defect-UK-Expert-says-flies-coming-Britain-container-ships-grooves-car-tyres.html"}
