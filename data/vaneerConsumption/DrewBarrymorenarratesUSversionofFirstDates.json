That is where the story unfolds. Even though you have an indication of whether it may work, the human heart is such that you never know what’s truly going on inside it.\n'We had one man called Derek who worked in the City but couldn’t take the rat race, so moved back to Chichester and used to sit at home and watch First Dates.\n'He found it hard to talk to anyone and couldn’t get a girlfriend, but he saw that we genuinely care about the people we feature, so he applied and we helped him find a date. It didn’t work out but it’s the first step, right?'\nHe also admitted to getting quite emotional through his work, saying: 'I get choked up a lot. I remember a lovely 82-year-old man called Terence who talked about how his wife died.\n'He had been in the RAF so was away a lot and he said, \"I never told her I loved her enough and I’ll always regret it.\" He welled up and I started welling up, too.\n'I’m married and when I’m in the edit, I text my partner things such as, \"By the way, I really love you and I’ll never cheat. OK, bye!\"'\nThe US version of First Dates is set to debut on NBC on April 7th.\nNot amused: Another woman is seen retreating to the restroom to declare she 'hates' her date\nVaried: Like the UK show, there appear to be as many disastrous dates as successful ones","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4319704/Drew-Barrymore-narrates-version-Dates.html"}
