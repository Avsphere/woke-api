John McCain (R-AZ) to play a round of golf, as he typically does Sunday (and as President Barack Obama did before him).\nThe Daily Mail reported, with original ALL CAPS: “Donald Trump returns to the golf course just 17 HOURS after the death of John McCain as he faces criticism for failing to properly honor GOP giant’s life and legacy.”\nAccording to the article, written by Megan Sheets, Trump was guilty of having merely posted a “meager tweet with his condolences” before returning to golf nearly a full day later.\nSheets reported:\nDonald Trump was spotted arriving at the golf course on Sunday morning, less than 17 hours after the death of Senator John McCain. The president has remained somewhat quiet about the Arizona Republican senator’s death, drawing criticism from both sides of the aisle after he posted a meager tweet with his condolences for the family that failed to acknowledge the impact McCain has had on American political life, and his record as one of the nation’s most celebrated war heroes. A group of both supporters and protesters gathered outside the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, as the president arrived, holding Make America Great Again signs as well as others that say ‘FAKE PRESIDENT’ and ‘RESIGN NOW’.\nMcCain had pointedly excluded Trump from attending his funeral, but apparently the president was expected to honor some sort of golf ban, out of respect.\nIn 2014, Obama golfed immediately after American journalist James Foley was beheaded by the terrorists of the so-called “Islamic State.”\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush infamously teed off — “Now watch this drive” — immediately after delivering a statement condemning terrorists.\nBut Trump, as Sheets reported, waited a mere 17 hours after expressing condolences to McCain’s family to enjoy a private golf game with his own.\nJoel B.
