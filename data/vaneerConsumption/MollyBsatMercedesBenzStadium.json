The certain kind he meant was the institutional kitchen: hotels that serve room service, chains that operate in office buildings, and other places not unlike Molly B’s, the anchor restaurant in Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta. It was an odd suggestion. Why would a club sandwich matter? Aren’t they the same everywhere?\nA club sandwich may seem boring, but the sandwich has a way of illustrating a kitchen’s priorities. Has the chef bothered to source good bread? Do the prep cooks care if their tomatoes are ripe? Is the bacon perfectly cooked and cut thick to impress or is it merely meeting the basic ingredient requirements of the sandwich? Was it hastily thrown together or stacked with care?\n<","url":"https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/dining/review-molly-offers-fried-chicken-with-view-mercedes-benz/FhhTx1cYWYJSc9PoS7EdvO/"}
