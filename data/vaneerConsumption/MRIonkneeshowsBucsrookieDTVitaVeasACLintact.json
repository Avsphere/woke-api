The first MRI in history to come back with positive news. He did not have the injury that they feared he might have had. We'll see how he is on Wednesday, but he was moving around pretty good when I saw him today and it was positive news.\"\nVea, selected 12th overall by the Buccaneers in the 2018 draft, didn't make his season debut until Week 4 against the Chicago Bears because of a strained calf muscle.\nHe has two tackles in four games (two starts) this season.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/mri-knee-shows-bucs-rookie-dt-vita-veas/story?id=58834285"}
