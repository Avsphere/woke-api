Thailand's royal palace released a vaguely worded health report late Sunday, Jan. 10, 2016 on the country's 88-year-old king, the world's longest reigning monarch who has been ailing for years, describing what appears to be a new bout of lung infection and occasional fever with rapid breathing. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit, File)\nThe king was given oxygen, intravenous antibiotics and other medication, the statement said, adding that \"currently, the king's fever has eased but his breathing is occasionally faster than normal, while his pulse and blood pressure are normal.\"\nThe statement did not make clear if the lung infection was gone.\nBhumibol, who took the throne in 1946, has faded from public life in recent years due to ill health.\nThe deeply revered king is a constitutional monarch with no formal political role but has been regarded as a stabilizing figure for Thailand, which has experienced political turmoil in recent years. Many regard him as a father figure and his Dec. 5 birthday is celebrated as Father's Day in Thailand.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3393409/Thailands-ailing-king-treated-lung-infection-fever.html"}
