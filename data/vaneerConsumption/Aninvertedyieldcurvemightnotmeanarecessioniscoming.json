Because historically a yield curve inversion is not a necessary precursor to a recession.\nTo begin with, the Fed did not begin making use of the Fed funds rate until 1954. The Fed itself didn't exist until 1914, and for the first 40 years of its existence only made use of the discount rate, which itself was not made uniform nationwide until 1935.\nAnd the Fed funds rate did *not* exceed the 10 year Treasury yield prior to either the 1957 or 1960 recessions. The first time that measure of the yield curve did invert was in 1965, which presaged a steep slowdown in 1966 which did not quite qualify as a recession:\nThe Bonddad Blog","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/recession-yield-curve-turning-negative-might-not-signal-downturn-2018-7"}
