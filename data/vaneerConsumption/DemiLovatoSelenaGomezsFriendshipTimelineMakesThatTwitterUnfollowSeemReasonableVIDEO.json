After revealing in a game of \"Shag, Marry, Kill\" involving Justin Bieber, Simon Cowell, and Joe Jonas that she would just kill all three of them (somebody should maybe give a Lovato a quick refresher on the rules next time) and pleading the titular fifth to a question about the worst thing she's seen a Disney star do, Cohen asked whether people were reading too much into Demi Lovato unfollowing Selena Gomez on Twitter earlier this year. After asking if she could plead the sixth (maybe just write out the rules of the game for Lovato next time?), she responded, \"I think it's just one of those things where people change and people grow apart.\"\nSure, that excuse totally works when your mom asks why you don't hang out with your middle school best friend anymore, I but doubt this will be last time Lovato (or Gomez for that matter) will be asked some variant of the question.\nEven if your interest in Lovato and Cohen is less than zero, I still highly recommend watching the video of the interview for the world’s cutest puppy, who inexplicably shows up just behind Lovato. I don’t even particularly want an explanation, just more puppy, please. Maybe even replace Cohen with the puppy (you can start him off with a guest hosting gig to make sure he’s properly house broken before giving Cohen the boot). Seriously, just watch it — I promise the puppy makes everything worth it.\nDemetria Lovato News on YouTube\nAnd for those of you still in denial about this particular BFF-breakup, here's a look back at their relationship and how The Great Twitter Unfollow of the 21st Century came to be.\nSOME TIME AROUND 1999 — LOVATO AND GOMEZ MEET ON THE SET OF BARNEY AND FRIENDS\nThe two have known each other since they were seven years old and met while filming Barney and Friends. If it makes you feel any better, you can watch this clip and try to live forever in the moments they spent splashing around in a kiddie pool.\nTheDemiLovatoFans on YouTube\nJANUARY 29, 2008 — THEY LAUNCHED THEIR VLOG\nLovato and Gomez put their friendship on full display with the vlog series they created together (appropriately titled \"Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato Vlog\"). Remember when people still said vlog? 2008 was truly a simpler time.\nJANUARY 2010 — THEY FIRST APPEAR TO BE ON THE OUTS\nIt appears Gomez and Lovato's friendship was first threatened by a tale of two Taylors. The Taylors Lautner and Swift apparently came between the two in 2010, when Gomez was dating Lautner and hanging out more with Swift.\nNOVEMBER 2011 — LOVATO CHECKED INTO REHAB\nLovato has been open about her struggles with eating disorders and self-harm and her subsequent rehab stint. She's also said it was a \"wake up\" call that taught her who her true friends were. Gomez has admitted that Lovato's time in rehab was difficult to handle.\nJason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nFEBRUARY 5, 2014 — LOVATO TWEETS HER SUPPORT OF GOMEZ’S REHAB STINT\nA few days after it was made public that Gomez also briefly attended rehab, Demi tweeted a message apparently in support of Gomez's decision that said, \"Weakness is living in denial. Only the strongest people ask for help.\"\nJULY 2014 — LOVATO UNFOLLOWS GOMEZ ON TWITTER\nAhhh yes, the unfollow heard 'round the world. She also apparently tweeted a photo collage that said \"bye bitch\" (among other sentiments), but it was later taken down.\nMost of us probably aren't friends with the same people we were when we were seven years old, so perhaps it's no surprise that Lovato isn't either.\nImages: Getty Images","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35957-demi-lovato-selena-gomezs-friendship-timeline-makes-that-twitter-unfollow-seem-reasonable-video"}
