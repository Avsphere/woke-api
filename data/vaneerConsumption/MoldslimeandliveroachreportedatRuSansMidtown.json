The restaurant was re-inspected Monday and received a 90.\nAccording to the inital report, a live roach was seen crawling on a wall near drinking cups; the pest control record showed the last date of service was in August.\nOfficials also reported seeing an \"employee slicing crab, and eating the same crab meat that was being prepared\" and \"bare-hand contact with ready to eat sushi at the sushi bar.\"\nAsked about the failed inspection, general manager Thai Nguyen said Tuesday that many of the violations were because staff was closing down the lunch buffet, saying the food was not going to be served.\n\"We were re-inspected and are back to 90,\" he said.\nNguyen said the score is not reflective of the restaurant, noting that it normally passes with A grades.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/mold-pink-slime-and-live-roach-reported-san-near-ansley-mall/jVMets2rLw2ZudLh9DlQLP/"}
