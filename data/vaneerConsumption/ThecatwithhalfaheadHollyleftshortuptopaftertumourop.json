Her fur was matted, she had an ear infection and scabs all over her face.\nBut she is now back on her feet - albeit a little bit lighter up top.\nGreg and his team are hopeful that they will now be able to find their fixed-up furry friend a loving new home.\nThe friendly moggie went under the knife earlier this month, surviving what vets described as a successful operation\nBut in doing so, it meant she lost the bulk of her skull - leaving her with just half of the head she had before\nGreg and his team are hopeful that they will now be able to find their fixed-up furry friend a loving new home\n'She is a lovely little cat, and I'm sure there is someone out there who would want to have her,' Greg said.\n'Despite what she has been through with the treatment of her cancer and her long term stay at the vets, she has a very sweet nature.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422901/The-cat-half-head-Stray-Holly-left-without-skull-vets-removed-tumour-ear.html"}
