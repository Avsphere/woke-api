And I think that’s become clear over the last few days.”\nHe was speaking in a joint interview with Breitbart News and this reporter’s Sunday night weekend talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio.”\nRegarding Shah’s advocacy of relocating the Jewish state to Israel, Choudary stated:\nAs far as Muslims are concerned, we want the whole of Palestine, which includes what Israel currently occupies, liberated. And I think that what Naz Shah said is not that far from what we would prefer, which is that those who came to occupy the Muslim land of Palestine should be returned from where they came. They are free to live in Russia and Poland and other places. But obviously do not occupy our land so that we are refugees in our own land.\nChoudary ignored the existence of historic Jewish communities that have lived in Israel continuously for hundreds of years. And he glossed over the history of Jewish refugees immigrating to Israel because they were forced to flee their homes throughout the Arab word after the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948.\nChoudary is a founder of the outlawed, pro-al-Qaida Al Muhajiroun organization in Britain. He is currently awaiting trial in the U.K. for allegedly encouraging support for the Islamic State.\nShah, meanwhile, was suspended from the UK Labour Party because of inflammatory Facebook comments she made about Israel before being elected to office. She is one of several Labour politicians currently embroiled in an anti-Semitism scandal.\nThe Jerusalem Post reported on her online posting:\nIn the Facebook post in question, revealed by the website Guido Fawkes, Shah published a graphic on Facebook that suggests the “relocation” plan accompanied by the text “solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict.” The graphic shows a map of the United States with an inlaid outline of Israel pictured in the middle of the North American country. “Problem solved and save u bank charges for £3 BILLION you transfer yearly!” Shah wrote in the caption to the post republished by the UK’s Independent. The post “highlights” a bullet-point list of reasons detailing the benefits of the hypothetical plan, which includes the text: “Palestinians will get their land and life back.” Shah admitted on Monday that she was responsible for the Facebook post. “This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views, and I apologize for any offense it has caused,” read a statement issued by the Labour member from Bradford West.\nAs Breitbart London reported on Saturday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that his party has commissioned an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism within its ranks.\nThis after Ken Livingstone, the former Labour mayor of London, was suspended over comments in which he asserted that Hitler was “supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.” Livingstone also claimed that anti-Semitism is not “exactly the same” as racism, a charge that Choudary supported in his interview with this reporter.\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
