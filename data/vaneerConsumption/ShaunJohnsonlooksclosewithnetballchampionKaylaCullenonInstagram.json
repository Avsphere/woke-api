Shaun Johnson and Kayla Cullen have sparked speculation of a romance after they shared two photos of themselves hanging out on Instagram\nIn the snap, the 25-year-old Warriors player and 23-year-old Silver Ferns star are in a pool together engaging in a hydrotherapy fitness session.\n'What it looks like when the students don't listen to their teacher,' joked Kayla.\nA fan then commented asking if the twosome are dating, to which Shaun responded: 'Narrrr we don't.'\nSeven weeks earlier Shaun posted a selfie of himself and Kayla smiling from a Red Bull-sponsored event that they were appearing at.\nSay cheese! The duo snapped a selfie together at the Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix in November, which they were contracted to appear alongside several other local sports stars\n'Day out with the flake and other legends judging the Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix,' wrote Shaun.\nA number of other local sports stars were at the event, including rally driver Hayden Paddon and professional drift driver ‘Mad’ Mike Whiddett.\nWhen asked about romance rumours, Kayla told The Daily Telegraph that they were just friends who liked spending time together like anybody else.\nDaily Mail Australia has reached out to the pair for comment.\nSimply stunning: The 23-year-old netball star is known for her beauty in addition to her skills as an athlete\nJust friends: Kayla insists that the pair are just friends, while Shaun told a fan on Insagram that they aren't dating\nMaking her laugh: Posing as a journalist, 25-year-old Shaun asked tennis champ Caroline Wozniacki, also 25, if she could follow him on social media platform Instagram\nLast Wednesday, Shaun decided to pose as a journalist at the ASB Classic in Auckland so he could ask Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki some cheeky questions.\n'On behalf of all male Kiwis in this country, and I hope your Dad doesn’t come after me after this one... can you follow me on Instagram?', the sportsman asked 25-year-old Caroline, who was previously engaged to Irish professional golfer Rory McIlroy.\nNo doubt taken by surprise when presented with such a question, blonde beauty Caroline initially giggled, before eventually responding with a simple 'yes'.\nObliging: No doubt taken by surprise when presented with such a question, blonde beauty Caroline initially giggled, before eventually responding with a simple 'yes'\nThen turning the tables and asking some cheeky questions herself, the tennis sensation asked Shaun: 'Are you following me?'.\nGiven the effort Shaun had gone to to speak to her, it was easy to assume he was a fan of her work, on the court.\nHe responded to her: 'Are you serious? I’ve followed you since...'\n'Well, as far as I know, you came to the players’ party to see Ana Ivanovic. I’m sure you follow Ana Ivanovic too,' Caroline then replied, not letting the rugby league star get the upper-hand so fast.\nShe was making reference to 28-year-old Serbian tennis player Ana, who was pictured with Caroline at the ASB Classic Newmarket Exhibition Match over the weekend.\nFollowing the exchange, Caroline even posed for a photo with Shaun.\nSharing the snap to his Instagram account, Shaun wrote to his over 193,000 followers: 'Chats with @carowozniacki last night. Was buzzing! @asbclassic can't wait to get out and watch this week Shouts to @workingstylenz for making me look the part (sic)'.\nFurthermore he wrote on his Twitter page: 'On the court she's amazing. But have to give her props for being a fun down to earth awesome chic off it. #TeamCaro (sic)'.\nDespite Caroline being a great sport during the pair's banter, it seems she hadn't quite followed through with her promise to follow Shaun on Instagram.\nNew connection: The handsome New Zealander was lucky enough to snap a photo with the Danish beauty\nHe's a fan: Shaun later took to Twitter to acknowledge the tennis star for being 'fun'and 'down to earth'\nBeing the centre of attention at a press conference on Friday, Shaun was asked by local media about his social media status with Caroline.\nBut he admitted Caroline still hadn't followed him, and asked the press to go back to her for an explanation.\n'So he’s stalking my Instagram now, that’s good to know!”, the Danish beauty joked when quizzed in a subsequent press conference, 'I don’t know, he should ask me himself.'\nCaroline was previously engaged to Irish golfer Rory McIllroy, before the pair split in 2014.\nSpeaking to FEMAIL in July last year, she said: 'I am single and happy to live my life. I'm not looking for anybody or anything, I'm just living my life.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3393387/Shaun-Johnson-looks-close-netball-champion-Kayla-Cullen-social-media-days-flirts-Danish-tennis-pro-Caroline-Wozniacki.html"}
