I’m disappointed in you, but I will be proud of when the day comes, because it’s coming where you will be at the podium announcing the name change. Because that will happen,” Kellerman stated.\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/08/04/espns-kellerman-disappointed-in-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-for-not-changing-team-name/"}
