Now the PRPW will lobby for research into any links between these early deaths and supplement use.\nThe organisation will look into creatine use (Steve Mitchell/Empics)\n“Sadly there have been four or five high-profile deaths in the Pacific Islands community, with Sione being the most recent,” said ex-Wasps and London Irish star Leo.\n“So we’re aiming to raise funding to commission a study into the health issues of creatine and supplement use.\n“Our genetic make-up is very different from the Anglo-Saxon make-up.\n“There was one small study carried out in New Zealand that said Pacific Islanders naturally have two times the natural creatine levels in their blood than white New Zealanders.\nEngland's Manu Tuilagi is a supporter of the organisation (Jonathan Brady/PA)\n“So when players are recommended to load up on creatine they may well not need it.\n“So these are the things we want to start delving into.\n“We just don’t think it’s good enough that we’ve had four or five players passing away all under their 40s and no one’s really looking into it.”\n:: For more information on commercial partnership opportunities with PRPW, visit www.pacificrugbywelfare.com.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4447168/Olympic-gold-winning-coach-Ben-Ryan-joins-board-Pacific-Rugby-Players-Welfare.html"}
