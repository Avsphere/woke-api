I'm healthy. I have no pain anywhere. I will just try to recover and see how I feel tomorrow. But my body feels good.\"\nKerber struggled with the intense heat early in her match, dropping the opening set without winning a game, but she battled on.\n\"It's good to have a match like this under my belt. It's always hot in Australia. I think it was a good match to prepare for Melbourne,\" she said.\nWith temperatures hitting 37 Celsius (99 Farenheit) the WTA's extreme heat policy came into force, allowing Kerber and Svitolina to take a 10-minute break before the third and deciding set.\nOther first-round winners on Monday were Italy's world number 19 Sara Errani over Spanish seventh seed Carla Suarez 6-3, 6-3, and German Sabine Lisicki, who eased past Slovenia's Polona Hercog 6-4, 6-3.\nIn the men's draw, Italian fifth seed Andreas Seppi eliminated Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan in three sets, but compatriot Simone Bolelli went out to American qualifier Alexander Sarkissian 6-2, 7-6 (7/5).","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393510/German-tennis-star-Kerber-stays-healthy-Sydney-heat-battle.html"}
