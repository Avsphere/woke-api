On Saturday, Zinedine Zidane won his debut match in the dugout 5-0.\nHere are five things the Frenchman has already changed at the Bernabeu.\nZinedine Zidane has already made changes at the Bernabeu and Sportsmail looks at five here\n1) Dani Carvajal is back at right back. Why exactly Real Madrid spent ‎€30million (£22.5m) on the Brazilian Danilo remains a mystery.\nCarvajal is 24 and set to contest the Spain right-back spot for the next decade. Danilo is a year older, not as good and yet he has featured ahead of Carvajal too much this season.\nCarvajal was back in on Saturday and delivered a brilliant run and cross for Gareth Bale's first goal to cap a fine display. Zidane appears to prefer the Spaniard and Bale is happy to have one of his best pals from the dressing room behind him on the pitch.\nDani Carvajal (right, pictured with Gareth Bale) returned at right back for Real Madrid on Saturday\n2) Isco was given his wings back and he flew forward at every opportunity in his return to the starting line-up. He tweeted after the game that he was glad to be back enjoying football and when he was accused of having had a pop at Rafa Benitez he clarified: 'I was referring to being back playing. Rafa is a great professional and I wish him all the best.'\nIsco has been likened to Zidane in terms of skill on the ball. He will now hope to thrive under the Frenchman.\nIsco (left, pictured with Zidane) surged forward whenever given the chance during Real Madrid's 5-0 win\nIsco flew forward at every opportunity in his return to Real Madrid's starting line-up under Zidane\n3) There was a joie de vivre about Real Madrid's football on Saturday. Benitez is a master tactician and someone who likes to take care of every last detail.\nFor most of Real Madrid's games in La Liga they are up against vastly inferior opposition and perhaps going out with fewer instructions in their heads lightened the load. Zidane's training sessions are said to be somewhat basics and his 'simple' approach extends to not always having a clever plan B. That might mean he comes unstuck in bigger games against better opposition but for now it will just produce a pleasing brand of happy football that puts a smile on everyone's face.\nZidane's training sessions are reportedly simple while his predecessor Rafa Benitez was a master tactician\n4) Jese the super sub. There is no room for the young striker in the starting line-up but that does not mean he cannot be hugely important coming off the bench.\nIt means that one of the sacred front three has to be taken off but Zidane has already shown he's not averse to that.\nHe took Bale off on Saturday because he had already scored his hat-trick. Zidane has such authority that you get the feeling if in another match situation taking Ronaldo off makes more sense then he will do it.\nJese will not be cracking into Real Madrid's starting XI but he can be important as a super substitute\n5) Bale is the man Real Madrid need to build their future around. At 26 he has all the qualities that Ronaldo had at the same age. A thunderous shot, a powerful header, strength, a burst of pace and the ability to assist and finish.\nZidane spoke with Bale one-to-one this week and time will tell how the two get on in the long term but the signs from the weekend were very positive. It doesn't necessarily follow that playing for a former hero works. Luis Suarez idolised Marco van Basten but when the Dutchman coached him at Ajax it was a disaster.\nZidane gave Bale very clear instructions on Saturday – your starting position is on the right but go where you can to harm the opposition. To say it worked well would be an understatement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3393494/Five-things-new-Real-Madrid-manager-Zinedine-Zidane-changed-introducing-5-0-win-Deportivo.html"}
