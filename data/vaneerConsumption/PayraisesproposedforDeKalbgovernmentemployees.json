The county would also create new pay ranges, and employees earning less than the minimum for their job would have their pay adjusted upward. The government is also implementing a pay-for-performance system that allows a clearer path for employees to be promoted.\nThe $1.38 billion midyear budget recommendation is $57 million, or 4.4 percent, higher than the spending plan the DeKalb Commission passed in February.\nMay also is proposing:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/pay-raises-proposed-for-dekalb-government-employees/8xEA25ydmukiCyDPDIHIgP/"}
