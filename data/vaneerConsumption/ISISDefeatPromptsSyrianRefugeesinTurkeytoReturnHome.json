But I’m still very afraid of the bombs, how would someone not be afraid of bombs?” said Fahriye, a 40-year-old housewife, reports AFP. “I’m also afraid of ISIL coming back. I’ll go and decide with my family whether we’ll stay or not.”\nSome refugees were glad to be back home ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which begins on June 18 in Syria.\n“It’s not so good here… It’s not like home,” Mahmud, a farmer, told AFP. “We want to spend our holy Ramadan in our homeland. We have been looking forward to it.”\nAccording to AFP, some analysts consider the ISIS defeat in Tal Abyad as the most significant in Syria so far.\n“The town was a key conduit for foreign fighters and supplies into ISIL-held territory in Syria and for exports of black market oil from jihadist-held fields,” notes AFP. “The loss cuts a key ISIL supply line to the jihadists’ de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa.”\nSOHR reports that Kurdish fighters, in coordination with Syrian rebel troops, carried out sweeps of Tal Abyad, looking for ISIS members and mines left behind by the jihadist group.\nThe monitor group said YPG and rebel forces asked residents of 10 villages in the area to leave their homes amid the searches.\nSome Syrian rebel groups had accused the Kurdish fighters of carrying out “a campaign of ethnic and sectarian cleansing” in Tal Abyad under “U.S.-led coalition air cover.”\nTurkey echoed those allegations, accusing the Kurdish forces of seeking to “ethnically cleanse” Tal Abyad and nearby regions of Arabs and Turkmen, reports AFP.\nHowever, the YPG and their Arab rebel allies denied the accusations.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/06/18/isis-defeat-prompts-syrian-refugees-in-turkey-to-return-home/"}
