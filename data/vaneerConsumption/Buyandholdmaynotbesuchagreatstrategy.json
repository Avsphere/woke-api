(There may be no better evidence of this than the StockTwits merch store - which I love, btw). And after one of the longest and strongest equity bull markets in history this should not come as any surprise. Investors are always influenced by recency bias and prone to extrapolation.\nWhat is surprising, however, is that, despite that fact that it's long-term (20-year) performance still crushes that of the broad stock market, gold has become so maligned among investors of all stripes, including gold bugs themselves. Yes, the past few years have favored equities over precious metals and I guess that's where the recency bias kicks in again. But the truth is it has paid far better to be gold bug over the past two decades than to be an equity bull.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/buy-and-hold-may-not-be-such-a-great-strategy-2018-7"}
