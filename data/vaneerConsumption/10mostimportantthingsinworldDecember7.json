The UK Supreme Court is now considering whether Article 50 needs approval from the Scottish parliament. Wrapping up day two of the battle to determine whether the UK government can use \"Royal Prerogative\" to take Britain out of the EU, or whether it must push a bill through parliament first, the court now must rule on whether Scotland's devolved parliament must also first approve the bill.\n3.

Gustavo Vargas and two other employees were taken into custody by Bolivian authorities for questioning after it was revealed that the plane apparently ran out of fuel.\n8.
