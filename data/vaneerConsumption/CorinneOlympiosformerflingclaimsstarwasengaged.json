A former fling of The Bachelor villain Corinne Olympios, pictured in Miami last weekend, has alleged the reality star was secretly engaged to an on-off boyfriend while appearing on the dating show\nKeith told the magazine of their recent get-together: 'She said to me, \"We're still together. I don't want anyone to know - you have to keep this a secret for me.\"'\nThe blogger added he thinks Corinne wanted to keep the relationship a secret because she didn't want to give people the impression she was appearing on The Bachelor for the 'wrong reasons.'\nMultiple sources have apparently told Us Weekly that Corinne is also engaged, but the Bachelor alum has insisted to the website that she is not betrothed.\nCorinne slammed the accusations when asked by the engagement rumors by E!, and said she and Keith were 'never anything.'\nSetting the record straight: Corinne, meanwhile, has repeatedly denied rumors she is engaged (pictured in March in Universal City)\nClaims: Keith Berman, a blogger who says he hooked up with the reality star two years prior, claimed to Us Weekly that Corinne, 24, insisted to him last month that she was with someone and even asked him to keep the information to himself (Keith pictured with Olympios)\n'No. I'm not engaged. Are you kidding me? This is getting so ridiculous,' she said. 'I'm getting fed up with all these rumors. Especially the rumors about Keith Berman.'\n'Keith Berman and I literally, literally are zero,' she added.\nKeith claimed on his blog, Live From The Gutter, that he and Corinne had 'a little fling...two years ago' and, in his most recent entry, that they 'just made out each time we saw each other'.\nResponding to her description of him from E!, Keith wrote in an entry posted Thursday: 'Woahhh Corinne that was harsh! Shots fired!'\nWill you accept this rose? Olympios catapulted to stardom while appearing on the latest season of The Bachelor\nSpeaking of her appearance on the show, he wrote: 'Your bachelor stint was a complete sham and now the whole town knows it!'\n'You HAD A FIANCÉE THE ENTIRE SHOW!', he added. 'You FAKED THE WHOLE THING!'\n'Trust me I know exactly who her \"Mystery man/ real ex boyfriend/fiancée\" is!'\nKeith also claimed he had a three-way call with Corinne and her alleged significant other after an Us Weekly headline referred to him as an 'ex' of the reality star.\nTalk of the town! The star made quite the splash while competing for Nick's heart\n'Regardless I took it all in stride and thought it was pretty cool at the end of the day, but you know who didn’t think it was cool…..CORINNE’S REAL \"EX BOYFRIEND!\" A.K.A her CURRENT FIANCÉE!!! (According to a source) ….. you know the actual guy that all you tabloids are trying to scrape up!\n'Ooo trust me he is very real people, he exists! Why did he care so much? Well he figured out the timeline of us hanging out was two years ago and sooner; and they’ve apparently been dating/together for 3 years so you do the math, he thought she cheated on him.\n'Or at least that's what I thought he was mad about when he was yelling at me on the phone! (Mind you they weren’t supposed to be in contact). But that didn’t stop her from throwing me into a 3-way phone call with him only to get my ear chewed out by him!!! I was ambushed!'\nSo fly: Olympios jetted into Los Angeles in fluffy beige shoes and black leggings\nCorinne catapulted to stardom while appearing on the latest season of The Bachelor.\nThe star became the villain of this latest season, and made it to the top four before being eliminated in New York City.\nIt seems America has become obsessed with her crazy antics and the young star revealed she might even be getting her own show.\nMaking an impression: The 24-year-old passionately kissed Viall\nShe told E! that 'a lot networks' have approached her about starring in her own show.\n'I think America is interested in me having a reality TV show with my family, my family is awesome, as you all could tell on my hometown date.\n'America totally wants it, I hear it all the time,' she said.\n'There is a lot of talk about, I'm going to say a lot of networks are interested. Obviously, my loyalty is here with ABC and things like that. So there's still a lot of stuff to be worked out, but we'll see what comes in the future.'\nThe finale of The Bachelor will air this coming Monday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4299654/Corinne-Olympios-former-fling-claims-star-engaged.html"}
