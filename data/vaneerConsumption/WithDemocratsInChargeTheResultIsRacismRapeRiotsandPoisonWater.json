The answer is more complicated than “Democrats.” Most of the people who run these institutions and communities are so much more than Democrats. They are leftists — hardcore, government-loving, Alinsky-worshipping, central planning, community-organizing leftists.\nAnd yet, when they enjoy free rein for decades, take a hard look at the utopia these utopians create.\nLet’s start with Hollywood, which is about as hard-left as any institution in the country. What we have here is a community run by leftists currently embroiled in a huge race scandal. For two years in a row, only white actors have been nominated for performance Oscars. Where leftists have enjoyed unchallenged rule for decades, 40 out of 40 acting nominations have gone to Whitey.\nAccording to the left-wing mainstream media, there is a rape crisis rampaging though America’s university system. If you choose to believe the studies and reports, campus rape is a full-blown epidemic. How is this possible when for decades hardcore leftists have enjoyed unchallenged rule over America’s higher education system. There are exceptions, of course, like Liberty University, where there is no rape cris– oh, wait, Liberty is run by conservative Christians.\nOn top of all that rape, according to the leftists who for decades have run the American university system, there is a major racism problem at the very same American university system Leftists… have… run… for… decades…\nLeftists take over Hollywood and the result is racism.\nLeftists take over the college campus and the result is racism and rape.\nAnd I’m just getting started.\nThe city of Flint, Michigan, has been imploding since the 1980’s. Now, due to mismanagement by city officials, the water is poisoned with lead. In every way imaginable, the city is an arm-pit. But how is that possible when Utopian-Democrats have run the city unchallenged for years? How is that possible when in 2006, Flint was voted the 10th most liberal city in America?\nAccording to our left-wing media, armed, racist government-employees (police officers) who are employed by Democrats (mayors) in cities run for decades by Democrats, are gunning down innocent black people: Chicago, Baltimore, Ferguson (which is run by the St. Louis county), and in some of those cases, riots follow.\nThe youth black unemployment rate is an astonishing 21%. Don’t most of these young people live in Liberal Utopias?\nWho is exclusively in charge of our failing urban public schools systems?\nAnyone want to talk about Detroit?\nDo not, though, make the mistake of blaming Democrats.\nYou can’t blame Democrats anymore than you can blame a rattlesnake bite on the rattlesnake.\nPredators prey, that’s what Democrats are and that is what Democrats do.\nAfter so many decades, you have to blame the stupid prey — the morons who live, work, and spend tens-of-thousands of dollars in tuition to be preyed upon.\nIf rapes and racism and riots and poisoned water don’t result in a political revolution, that’s not your problem or my problem or America’s problem.\nIt’s a choice.\nUntil the sheep fire up a flare telling the world they are ready for change, all you can do is hold on to your compassionate hope that someday that time comes.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/01/21/with-democrats-in-charge-the-result-is-racism-rape-riots-and-poison-water/"}
