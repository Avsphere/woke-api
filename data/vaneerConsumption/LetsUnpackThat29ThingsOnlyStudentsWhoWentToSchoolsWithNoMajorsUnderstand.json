It's a question most of us college students get, but that some of us will never be able to answer. While most institutions of learning follow the model of choosing from a set of school-offered majors, for some of us, the idea of a major was always too restrictive.\nBecause what if the thing you wanted to study (say, pop culture) isn't a major? Even worse, what if you didn’t know what you wanted to do at all, but knew you wanted to mix a bunch of things into one concentration? If the idea of not melding your interests in writing, psychology, fashion and gender studies sounded oppressive and limiting, then you might have ended up in a program where you could design your own major — or as we like to call it — concentration.\nAt colleges without majors, or rather, schools with individualized study programs, you didn’t have to choose a major from a pre-ordained list of subjects. You could make your own concentration! These amazing institutions of learning allow you to meld dueling left and right brain subjects: art and psychology, history and science — HELL — woodworking and politics if you so desired.\nIf you went to one of the schools — or are lucky enough to be at one now — then your college experience was probably incredible. And there are some things only you you can truly understand. Things like...\nWhen you applied to college, you had NO idea what you wanted to study\nYou were interested in a few different subjects, but didn’t want to choose the wrong one\nThen you heard about these groovy colleges where you could make your own major\nSo you applied to Hampshire College, NYU Gallatin, The New School, or Brown and said...\nI can choose everything, EFF INSTITUTIONALIZED ACADEMIC BOUNDARIES\nYou weren't going to pigeon-hole your intellect —YOU HAVE IMAGINATION!\nyou knew you made the right decision when Your course catalog boasted classes like this\nOr this...\nEvil filled up super quick every semester.\nonce you got to school, Your classes were small and discussion-based\nAnd you didn't sit at desks. you had CONFERENCE TABLES.\nI wanna look you in the eye when we intellectually spar...\nyour professor's go-to term was \"Let's unpack this...\"\nAnd may the Universe have mercy on your soul if you didn't read the week's assignment\nOr check your privilege\nYour peers were always marrying subjects that didn't seem to go together in super interesting ways\nSocial entrepreneurship and Latin American political history? Awesome.\nNo matter the subject of your seminar, your syllabus was chockfull of social theory...\nNever stop questioning anything or thinking critically.\nwhich gave you the ability to basically intellectualize anything\nFrom post-modernism to post-structuralism, sometimes you don't even understand the language you use in class. Your brain moves faster than your mouth, and half the time you don't even understand what you're saying. It both amazes and terrifies you.\nThere were always one or two kids in your class with weird names\nYou know, like the girl who sits next to you in your seminar \"Re-imagining the Disney-Industrial Complex?\" Her legal name is Jane, but she goes by \"Windsor Chair.\"\nThe pretension factor in your classes was real\nYou lived in a tornado of higher-order thinking, but you loved it.\nWhen you explain to an outsider that you made your own major, they go\nPeople may think that it makes you a bit airy fairy....\nBut when friends from other schools changed their majors, you were like\nAhead of the curve.\nCome senior year, you had to pull off a crazy, multi-faceted thesis project\nYou had a panel discussion and an art installation and maybe a play. But first, you had to read all of Pierre Bourdieu's Distinction, because your advisor said so.\nand you probably didn't sleep for two months straight...\nThe library is your home now.\nBut this was a labor of love\nYou're the one who chose to major in \"style as a form of protest, as seen in midcentury youth subcultures.\"\nWhen the fateful day came, you bested the project\nYou slayed the individualized study dragon.\nbut Graduation was a big bowl of bittersweet\nThis is the most perfect place on earth and I don't wanna leave!\nas it turned out, explaining your school's program makes you crazy interesting to employers\nIn the working world, your individualized major is actually an advantage. It's all about spin, baby.\nplus, you basically majored in the art of bullshiting\nHaters gonna hate, but that's useful.\nVIVA LA ACADEMIC FREEDOM!\nSallie Mae might be on your ass, but at least you got to choose your own debt adventure.\nImage: NYU Gallatin (3); Giphy","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/26528-lets-unpack-that-29-things-only-students-who-went-to-schools-with-no-majors-understand"}
