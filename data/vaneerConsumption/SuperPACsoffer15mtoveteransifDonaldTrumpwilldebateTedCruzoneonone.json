Cruz's allies are convinced a one-on-one debate would propel their guy to the front of the pack\nDuring last month's Republican debate things finally got heated between Trump and Cruz as Trump brought up the 'birther' issue with Cruz's candidacy, that he was born in Canada to an American mother, and Cruz brought up Trump's 'New York values,' as a way to expose the billionaire as a flip-flopper on the issue of abortion.\nIn the first instance, Cruz was able to defend his citizenship.\nIn the latter, Trump used Cruz's 'New York values' comments to mount a defense of his home city and how its citizens braved the aftermath of 9/11.\nCruz was robbed of a rematch when Trump decided Tuesday night to pull out of the Fox News Channel debate.\nTrump said he was angry about some of the statements that came out of Fox's PR shop after he complained about 'biased' anchor Megyn Kelly once again being chosen to moderate.\nInstead of attending the debate, Trump rented out a room at nearby Drake University and is now hosting a competing event in which any money raised will go toward veterans and wounded warriors.\nWhen Donald Trump heard that Ted Cruz was challenging him to a debate, he joked about Cruz's formerly Canadian citizenship\nThis announcement got the Mercer and Neugebauer families thinking and so the $1.5 million offer was made.\nIn order to get the donation, Trump would have to go one-on-on with Cruz before Monday night.\nAt a campaign stop in West Des Moines, Iowa earlier on Wednesday Cruz suggested he already had a time and place in mind.\n'We have a venue, we have a time – all we're missing is a candidate,' Cruz said, labeling Trump a 'fragile soul' who is afraid to answer tough queries from Iowans.\n'Western Iowa Tech,' he said. '8:00 Saturday night, a two-hour, one-on-one debate,' Cruz said.\nHis super PAC donors, however, said for Trump to get the money he would only have to debate Cruz for one hour.\nAs a bonus perk, the candidates could choose a moderator.\nWhen Trump heard that Cruz wanted a one-on-one debate Wednesday he took to Twitter to joke about it.\n'Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again,' Trump wrote. 'Can we do it in Canada?'\nTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, took the question more seriously.\nTalking to Erin Burnett on CNN last night Lewandowski seemed open to a duel, but only once the number of candidates dwindled down to two.\n'Of course,' Lewandowski said of accepting such a challenge.\n'At the end of this race it's going to come down to two candidates for the Republican nomination at some point. If Ted Cruz is fortunate enough to be that second candidate, we'll be happy to debate him one on one on any debate stage that is available to us under the rules of the Republican National Committee,' Lewandowski continued.\n'So if Ted Cruz is the last man standing next to Donald Trump, we'll be happy to debate him,' Lewandowski added.\nUnable to help himself, the campaign manager then used the opportunity to rib the Cruz campaign.\n'You know, what this comes down is Ted Cruz's campaign has been desperate, has been falling apart in the state of Iowa,' Lewandowski said.\nHe suggested that Cruz's poll numbers are going down because voters in Iowa are concerned that the Texas senator, who was born in Canada, doesn't have a legal right to run for president of the United States.\n'You know, potentially, he should go and get a declaratory judgment from the courts to make sure that that question is put aside before people start voting on Monday in the caucuses,' Lewandowski said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3420899/Donald-Trump-leads-7-points-Iowa-19-New-Hampshire-16-South-Carolina.html"}
