(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says businesses and individuals will receive a \"massive tax cut\" under a tax changes package he plans to unveil next week.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Trump said the plan will result in tax cuts for both individuals and businesses. He would not provide details of the plan, saying only that the tax cuts will be \"bigger I believe than any tax cut ever.\"\nThe president said the package will be released \"Wednesday or shortly thereafter\" — just before his 100-day mark in office.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin initially set a goal of getting tax reform passed by August, but that deadline has slipped. Mnuchin now said the administration still hoped to get a bill passed well before the end of the year.\nRead Saturday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/apr/21/trump-says-he-will-release-tax-changes-package-nex/?page=1"}
