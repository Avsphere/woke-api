In this series finale, host Dee Dee Bridgewater and producer Becca Pulliam relive memories and musical highlights from the show's 23-year run. We look back on artists who were featured on JazzSet early in their careers, like Roy Hargrove and an early incarnation of the Dave Holland Quintet, and share live broadcasts from the Newport Jazz, Mount Hood and Detroit Jazz festivals. We also share memories of jazz pianist and spokesman Dr. Billy Taylor, who hosted the first NPR jazz program.\nThere are too many highlights to mention in one program, but we do our best in this intimate, bittersweet farewell. On behalf of the entire JazzSet team, we thank you for lending us your ears and hearts for the last two decades.\nSet List","url":"https://www.npr.org/2014/10/02/353256144/jazzset-signs-off"}
