Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan will seek to amend the energy bill to \"protect children from water that is deadly or poisonous.\" As many as 7,000 children have been \"poisoned because of lack of proper government oversight\" of Flint's water supply, Durbin said.\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called the situation in Flint \"really, really frightening.\" Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, tried to \"save a few bucks with the water and, in the process, poisoned lots of people,\" Reid said.\nFlint's water became contaminated when the financially struggling city switched from the Detroit municipal system and began drawing from the Flint River in April 2014 to save money. State officials were in charge of the city at the time.\nRegulators failed to ensure the new water was treated properly and lead from pipes leached into the water supply, contributing to a spike in child lead exposure. Some children's blood has tested positive for lead, a potent neurotoxin linked to learning disabilities, lower IQ and behavioral problems.\nReid said the amendment would likely focus on other municipal water supplies beyond Flint.\n\"We have a lot of communities around this country who have lead pipes, and a very deteriorating water system. So ... that's something we want to focus on, for sure,\" Reid told reporters Wednesday.\nPeters and Stabenow declined to offer details of the amendment, but said an announcement was likely Thursday.\nEarlier Wednesday, the pair, along with Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., proposed separate legislation to clarify the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to notify the public if a danger from lead is in their water system.\nThe bill would direct the EPA to notify residents and health departments if the amount of lead found in a public water system requires action, in the absence of notification by the state.\nThe EPA's Midwest regional director announced her resignation last week in connection with the water crisis, and EPA chief Gina McCarthy issued an emergency order directing state and city officials to take actions to protect public health. While much of the public blame has been directed at Snyder and other state officials, particularly the state Department of Environmental Quality, the EPA's Region 5 office, which covers six Great Lakes states, has also been criticized for not acting more forcefully.\nThe EPA has acknowledged that state officials notified the EPA last April that Flint was not treating the river water with additives to prevent corrosion from pipes. Susan Hedman, the EPA's regional chief, voiced concern to state and city officials over the next few months. But it wasn't until Oct. 16 that EPA established a task force to provide technical help — the day Flint switched back to the Detroit water system.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420068/Senate-Democrats-push-address-Flint-water-crisis.html"}
