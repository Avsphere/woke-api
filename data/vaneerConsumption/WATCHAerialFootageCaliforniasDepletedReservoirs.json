In May, scientists at the National Climate Prediction Center raised the possibility of El Niño to 90 percent.\nBut some water officials say that even a “super El Niño” wouldn’t be enough to pull the state out of its record drought.\nCheck out DWR’s aerial footage above.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2015/07/24/watch-aerial-footage-californias-depleted-reservoirs/"}
