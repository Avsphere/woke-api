He was seen putting on ice packs in the dressing room.\n\"It was quite an intense chase to the boundary line. In his intent to save that one run, he stopped the ball but landed on his right shoulder when he rolled over,\" Sridhar told reporters after the day's play.\n\"The impact was quite heavy because of the momentum he was carrying and there was a shock on his right shoulder.\"\nAustralia piled on the runs in Kohli's absence to end the day on 299 for four with skipper Steve Smith (117) and Glenn Maxwell (82) at the crease.\nThe batting duo put on a 159-run stand for the fifth wicket with Rahane rotating his bowling options with little success, but Sridhar was impressed with how Kohli's deputy handled the situation.\n\"I thought Ajinkya did a good job filling in for Virat...He kept taking advice from Ishant (Sharma) and (Ravichandran) Ashwin who are the seniors of the team,\" said Sridhar.\nKohli has already been off the ground for over three hours and will have to take the field for an equal amount of time before he is able to bat at his usual number four position.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4320054/India-Test-captain-Virat-Kohli-undergo-scans-shoulder.html"}
