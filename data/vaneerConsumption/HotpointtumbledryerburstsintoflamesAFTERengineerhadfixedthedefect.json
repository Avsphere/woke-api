Marinakis put water on the smoke and flames before turning machine off. The fire had subsided before it was able to sweep through the house, where three people were in at the time\nIt is known that pets have died through smoke inhalation and there was one report suggesting a 39-year-old man from Wales may have been killed.\nAt the time, the company announced that it would be sending out engineers to homes across the country to modify the machines and make them safe.\nHowever, one Hotpoint machine burst into flames and smoke just hours after an engineer had visited to modify the machine.\nThe episode raises serious questions about the modifications being ordered by the company and the competence of its engineers.\nDennis Marinakis, pictured above, said the response from the company has been 'appalling' and 'robotic'\nDetails were revealed by Dennis Marinakis, from south east London, who said: ‘Like many people we responded to this fire safety warning and contacted the company which said it would send out an engineer.\n‘We had the machine for at least four years and never had a problem with it. Yet, within a few hours of the engineer supposedly fixing it, it burst into flames.’\nMr Marinakis put the tumble dryer on at around 10.30pm on Thursday night and planned to go to bed, but his partner was alerted by the smell of smoke from the utility room.\n‘There were flames and smoke. I panicked and threw water on it, which I now realise is not the right thing to do with an electrical fire,’ he said.\nMr Marinakis managed to turn the machine off and the fire and smoke subsided before it could sweep through the £850,000 two bed detached property in Camberwell.\nThere were three people in the property at the time said Mr Marinakis, a 53-year-old property developer, including his partner and a lodger.\n‘I just can’t understand how this could happen. We did everything asked of us by the company and yet we had a fire after the machine was fixed,’ he said.\n‘Like many people, we put the machine on before we went to bed. If we had not noticed the smoke, there was a real possibility of lives being lost.’\nMr Marinakis, who captured a video of the smoke on a smartphone, said the response from customer service at the company has been appalling.\n‘The response was very robotic. We could have been killed, but there was no great concern,’ he said.\nThe company has said they will send out a technical expert at the end of next week to assess what happened. In the meantime, they are without a tumble dryer and have to use a laundrette to dry the washing.\nHe said the episode raises serious concerns about whether the engineers have been properly trained and know what they are doing.\nThere is also a worry that the fix that they are carrying out on the machines does not eliminate the fire risk.\nThe problem relates to the filters on the machines, which are close to the heating element, becoming clogged with fluff.\nThe Italian-owned Indesit group failed to issue a safety recall despite a record of fires in its tumble dryers dating back many years.\nThe company was taken over by Whirlpool of the USA last year. It ordered the safety recall after examining Indesit’s fire report records.\nWhirlpool said: ‘All of our engineers are fully trained and they meet all the requisite qualification standards.\n‘We investigate all reported incidents thoroughly and in this particular case we will collect the machine and investigate further.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3394365/Hotpoint-tumble-dryer-centre-fire-risk-warning-burst-flames-engineer-supposedly-fixed-defect.html"}
