They bought the stake for £12,497 in 1997 and sold it for £31,500, four months before he became prime minister in 2010.\nProtesters, many wearing Panama hats and some carrying signs reading “Eton’s Mess”, in reference to the exclusive school attended by Cameron, and “What goes in Panama does not stay in Panama”, marched from Cameron’s central London office to Trafalgar Square on Saturday, bringing traffic to a halt.\nThe revelations in the Panama Papers, resulting from what the law firm blamed on a computer hack launched from abroad, revealed how the world’s wealthy stashed assets in offshore companies.\n– Demonstration in Iceland –\nMeanwhile, a major anti-government rally attracted thousands of protesters in Iceland on Saturday, the sixth consecutive day of protests since the document leak.\nThe leak has already claimed the scalp of prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson following revelations that he and his wife owned an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands and had placed millions of dollars of her inheritance there.\nThe issue is particularly sensitive in Iceland following the 2008 collapse of the nation’s three main banks, which plunged the country into a deep recession and left thousands mired in debt.\nIn Panama, President Juan Carlos Varela said Friday that France’s decision to put the central American country on its list of tax havens in the wake of the revelations was “wrong”.\n“The decision taken by France’s government is a wrong and unnecessary step, even more so given the communication between both heads of state and the fact the world needs multilateral cooperation from all countries to tackle global problems,” he told reporters.\nHe added that his finance minister, Dulcidio de la Guardia, would travel to Paris on Tuesday to stress that Panama was a country that was “dignified, respectful and open to dialogue”, as well as one committed to greater transparency.\nPolice on Friday raided the El Salvador offices of Mossack Fonseca, netting “a good amount of computer equipment”, the country’s state prosecutor’s office said on its Twitter account.\nNo arrests were made.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/04/10/david-cameron-tax-avoidance-row/"}
