Decision Intelligence, which will launch in all markets, marks MasterCard's first global implementation of AI.\nThat's critical for both merchants and Mastercard as they look to solve a complex problem.\nCard fraud continues to rise, especially when it comes to e-commerce. Both the number and value of fraudulent transactions rose in the US in 2016. Much of that fraud is shifting online — from October 2015 through April 2016, e-commerce fraud attacks rose 11%. And cost per dollar for digital fraud grew by up to 12% year-over-year, compared to just 3% growth for physical fraud, which illustrates how costly this is for merchants. That's led players to invest in robust fraud prevention offerings, including extra verification steps and increased manual review.\nBoth the number and value of fraudulent transactions rose in the US in 2016.

That's led players to invest in robust fraud prevention offerings, including extra verification steps and increased manual review. But these efforts may actually create more problems. Adding steps or increasing manual review can make purchasing challenging, which can lead to cart abandonment and lost sales. But even when customers do complete a purchase, these tools aren't always effective. Stringent purchase monitoring increases false declines, or purchases that are declined because they look fraudulent, but aren't. Fifty-eight percent of declined transactions were false positives in 2016, according to LexisNexis. BI Intelligence estimates this cost US e-commerce merchants $8.6 billion last year, exceeding both actual fraud losses and the amount saved from prevented fraud.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mastercard-is-turning-to-ai-to-prevent-false-declines-2016-12"}
