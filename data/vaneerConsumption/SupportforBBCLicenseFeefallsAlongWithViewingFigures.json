This compares to the left wing Liberal Democrat supporters, with only 24 per cent agreeing with that statement.\nAs well as marked differences of opinions between political party supporters, which long running debates on the biased nature of the broadcaster would have contributed to, the numbers suggest a difference along class lines.\nSajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, recently suggested that many families are struggling to afford the flat rate fee which makes up a much larger percentage of outgoings for the families of low income families compared to those taking home a larger salary.\nWhile 47 per cent of middle-class viewers say that the licence fee is good value, only 29 per cent of working-class respondents believe that to be the case.\nThe option of combining those two options was supported by just 7 per cent of voters and 11 per cent admitted they had no thoughts on how the BBC should be funded.\nThe viewing habits of Britons are changing significantly, with the baby boomer generation watching double the amount of TV as their children who increasingly get their news from online providers and watch programmes online or on streaming websites.\nA survey for regulator OfCom found that children between the ages of 11 and 15 spend six times longer watching internet video clips as older viewers but spend much less time watching programmes on traditional television sets.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2014/12/27/support-for-bbc-license-fee-falls-along-with-viewing-figures/"}
