When it did arrive, I felt like a human with two giant dangly cow udders from my chest. I was overwhelmed at the amount of milk I had during the first days.\n'When my son closed his mouth it wasn’t visible to the human eye, the nerve function was so weak in the left side he couldn’t tighten it to form a vacuum,' she explained\n'It took forever for him to finish a bottle and despite being told it was me, I just didn’t understand,' Ms Shelby said\n'Putting washing out one day, as I leant down my partner was laughing in the back doorway at something. He was laughing at me. My new milk balloons had made their way out of my maternity bra and I had been watering the grass for a good 10 seconds.'\nMs Shelby went to lactation nurses who told her she was not latching properly but they were not to know that there were more serious problems at hand.\n'During the process of seeking help, I felt, even more, pressure. I was told not to give up. I had the milk, I just had to learn the skill of breastfeeding,' she said.\nFeeling defeated and spending countless nights up late and on the verge of tears, desperately trying to feed her baby - often making formula up to make sure Ryan was fed.\n'The crazy thing is despite all of the stress I was going through, the feeding difficulties – I STILL had a lot of pressure to breastfeed. Especially once Chemotherapy commenced,' she said\nThe attitude towards women who do not breastfeed is very poor.\n'It took forever for him to finish a bottle and despite being told it was me, I just didn’t understand. I had been trying so hard. What is wrong with me? Why can’t I feed my own son? Even bottle feeding seems difficult.' She wrote.\nAfter the tumour and facial palsy were diagnosed, everything made sense.\nBut Ms Shelby still felt as though she had to breastfeed - even moreso than she did before.\n'When my son closed his mouth it wasn’t visible to the human eye, the nerve function was so weak in the left side he couldn’t tighten it to form a vacuum. I’m sure I don’t have to explain how both bottle and breastfeeding works – it requires sealing the area off for continuous flow,' she wrote.\nMs Shelby said the pressure only subsided when the oncologist told her she was 'crazy' and to stop breastfeeding immediately\n'This also explained the slight reflux, my baby had been constantly sucking in a very subtle amount of air during feeding time.\n'The crazy thing is despite all of the stress I was going through, the feeding difficulties – I STILL had a lot of pressure to breastfeed. Especially once Chemotherapy commenced.'\nMs Shelby said the pressure only subsided when the oncologist told her she was 'crazy' and to stop breastfeeding immediately.\n'He could see that I had turned myself inside out over this. I had even convinced myself my baby would have a better chance of survival if I breastfed during Chemotherapy,' she said.\n'Don’t always assume a woman CHOOSES not to breastfeed. There are a number of factors which can get in the way,' she said\nMs Shelby shared her story with the hope of urging parents and experts to stop pressuring mothers to breastfeed.\n'While I 100% agree if you can breastfeed – do it. The experience the first time around made me very observant when I went on to have more children,' she said.\n'The attitude towards women who do not breastfeed is very poor and even asking a woman \"Are you breastfeeding?\" – seems like a very personal question to me.\n'Don’t always assume a woman CHOOSES not to breastfeed. There are a number of factors which can get in the way. MY story is an unlikely one, but I didn’t deserve some of the ignorant things said to me during that time.\n'The Bottom Line. FED IS BEST.'\nRyan, who is now a healthy 10-year-old, still struggles with facial paralysis but his internal tumour has completely disappeared and his intradural (outside of the skull) tumour is now a small, inactive lump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4300142/Mother-opens-pressure-felt-breastfeed.html"}
