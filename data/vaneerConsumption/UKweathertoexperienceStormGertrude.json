It comes ahead of Britain's seventh named storm which will bring 90mph winds later tonight\nSpring-like conditions: The first snowdrops of the year emerged outside St Andrew's Church in Hurstbourne Priors, Hampshire, today as Britain enjoyed Spring-like conditions, including blue skies and warm temperatures. However, forecasters warn Storm Gertrude will hit later\nThe first snowdrops of Spring: The stunning white flowers were spotted in the churchyard in Hurstbourne Priors, Hampshire, today\nBeautiful on the eye: The brightly-coloured flowers, a key sign that Spring has sprung, have blossomed just yards away from St Andrew's Church, Hampshire, which was built in 902. The Met Office has now issued a number of weather warnings for today and into the weekend\nSunshine and flowers: The first daffodils of the year emerged outside St Andrew's Church in Hurstbourne Priors in Hampshire today\nStorm warnings: Severe weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office for rain for parts of the country today (left), while amber and yellow-graded warnings are in place tomorrow for rain, snow, ice and wind for pretty much the whole country except the south east (right)\nHere comes Storm Gertrude: This graphic from Earth Net shows weather system currently sweeping off the Atlantic and into Britain today\nA succession of storms since December has seen widespread flooding and major disruption to travel, with the latest deluge expected to continue through to the weekend – causing further misery to flood-hit communities.\nThe Met Office has issued an amber 'be prepared' warning for high winds in Northern Ireland, Scotland and both the north west and north east of England from 3am until mid-morning tomorrow.\nSouth-westerly gales are expected to develop during the early hours with gusts of 60-70mph seen widely across Britain, and up to 90mph expected near exposed coasts and on higher ground. The Met Office said gusts of up to 90mph across Orkney and Shetland are likely.\nForecasters have warned of structural damage to buildings, disruption to power supplies and chaos on the nation's roads and rail networks.\nThe winds are expected to ease off later on Friday afternoon, but will be replaced by heavy rain and a plunge in temperatures – which could see snow, ice and even potential blizzards.\nA spokesman said: 'Winds are expected to widely gust 60-70mph, possibly up to 90mph along exposed coasts and over hills.\n'Be prepared for the likelihood of difficult driving conditions and disruption to travel, such as cancellation to ferry services and bridge closures.\n'Some structural damage is also possible, as well as disruption to power supplies. Heavy rain and surface water will be additional hazards in places.\n'With winds strengthening for a time again overnight there is the risk of blizzard conditions, particularly over higher ground in the north of Scotland.'\nYellow 'be aware' warnings for rain, snow and ice are in place across much of the UK for today, tomorrow and Friday, meaning Saturday is the only day which is likely to see brief respite from the extreme conditions.\nThis graphic shows the strong winds which will sweep across Britain thanks to Storm Gertrude over the next 24 hours. The darker the red, the stronger the winds will be. Forecasters warn winds could reach 60mph-70mph widely with up to 90mph expected in exposed areas\nWarnings: Severe yellow-graded warnings for rain, snow and ice are in place for large swathes of the country on Saturday (left), while wind weather warnings have been issued for the Midlands, northern England, Northern Ireland and the whole of Scotland for Sunday (right)\nHISTORIC 18TH CENTURY BRIDGE COLLAPSES INTO RAGING RIVER AFTER DAYS OF HEAVY RAIN ACROSS CUMBRIA An 18th century stone bridge has collapsed into a fast-flowing river more than six weeks after it was damaged during Storm Desmond. Bell Bridge, near Sebergham and Welton, crumbled into the raging River Caldew yesterday after weeks of relentless rain. The historic bridge was originally damaged during the storms which devastated the region last month. However, the grade II listed stone structure had managed to remain largely intact despite all the rain - before succumbing to high river levels yesterday. Barriers and road closure signs have now been placed at either end of the bridge, with dramatic pictures showing it completely washed away by the recent bad weather. Gone: The 18th Century Bell Bridge over the River Caldew near Welton in Cumbria collapsed at lunchtime yesterday after days of heavy rain raised the water level of the river. Britain enjoyed a brief break from the heavy downpours today but more rain will sweep in tonight Crikey: The historic Bell Bridge over the River Caldew near Welton in Cumbria collapsed after a spell of heavy rain in recent days. It comes as flood-hit communities across Cumbria were hit with flooding for a fourth time in eight weeks, with more deluge still to come this week Going, going, gone: A road closed sign warns motorists about the dangerous situation after the 18th century Bell Bridge collapsed Devastating: The 18th century Bell Bridge in Welton, Cumbria, collapsed into the fast-flowing river after heavy rainfall in recent days How it once looked: The Bell Bridge in Cumbria before it was damaged and collapsed into the river yesterday after recent winter storms\nPaul Gundersen, chief operational meteorologist at the Met Office, said: 'A rapidly deepening area of low pressure is expected to bring a spell of severe weather across northern Britain on Friday.\n'There remains some uncertainty over the exact track and intensity of the storm, so people are urged to keep up to date with the latest UK forecast so that they can prepare for the weather.\n'However, there is higher confidence now in the likelihood of a period of very strong winds early on Friday with a spell of storm force winds across the Northern Isles.'\nAlerts: A number of flood warnings and alerts remain in place for communities across the UK, according to the Environment Agency\nEngineers are on standby to deal with power outages caused by the extreme weather but homeowners are urged to be prepared for possible disruption.\nA statement from Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution (SHEPD) said: 'We have 400 front line and support staff standing by and we have moved engineers to the areas we expect to be hit by the storm. Mobile generators and other resources are also being moved.\n'Members of the public should not approach fallen or damaged power lines, which may still be live.'\nTransportNI, the sole road authority in Northern Ireland responsible for public roads, footways, bridges, and street lights, also warned of disruption.\nA spokesman said: 'TransportNI staff are on standby to deal with the severe weather conditions which winter can bring.\n'Winds of this strength have the capacity to bring down trees and lead to high waves along the coast. We would urge the public to take care when they are out on the roads and to expect potential disruption during the morning rush hour.'\nMeanwhile, ScotRail will operate a limited service on Friday with routes in the Highlands and west coast particularly affected.\nNo trains are expected to run until at least the afternoon between Perth and Inverness; Glasgow and Fort William; Dumbarton and Helensburgh; Kilmarnock and Stranraer; Kilwinning and Ardrossan; Ayr and Girvan; and Glasgow and Dunblane.\nThe routes are likely to bear the brunt of 90mph winds with high tides also forecast.\nOperators said hundreds of engineers will be deployed across the network to inspect lines, repair damage and reopen routes as quickly as possible.\nPhil Verster, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said: 'We will be withdrawing some services until the worst of the storm has passed.\n'The safety of our passengers and workforce is our top priority and we cannot run services on these lines until our engineers have thoroughly inspected the network for any damage.\n'We will be monitoring the weather conditions closely throughout the day and have specialist teams ready to deploy quickly to deal with any issues caused by the storm.\n'We are also working closely with our industry partners to limit disruption while maintaining a safe network for passengers.'\nThe unsettled weather conditions of late are expected to continue into next week with further rain, snow and winds likely to cause disruption for the foreseeable future.\nThe news of Storm Gertrude comes as around 600 people were evacuated from their homes in the Scottish Borders yesterday over renewed flooding fears. Firefighters also had to rescue a bus driver caught in water on the B6405 route near Hawick.\nMaking the most of it: A group of people enjoy the sunshine and stop for a picnic at Mudeford Sandbanks in Christchurch today\nStunning scenery: Walkers wrapped up warm in winter coats as they made the most of the Spring-like conditions at Hengistbury Head\nBrave: Three women enjoyed a dip in the calm waters at Brighton Beach today - making the most of the sun before Storm Gertrude hits\nEmbracing the cold: Three women braved the chilly sea temperature, but made the most of the sunshine, for a dip at Brighton Beach today\nWatching the sea: A young woman stood looking out over the waves at Hengistbury Head in Dorset today (left), while a man and a young boy also did some wave-watching from the pebbly beach at Brighton (right).
