The report says the group claims dozens were wounded in the attack on Boulikessi base near the border with Burkina Faso.\nExtremist violence has been mounting over the past year along the Mali-Burkina Faso border.\nThe newly formed extremist group merges Ansar Dine, al-Mourabitoun and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb.
