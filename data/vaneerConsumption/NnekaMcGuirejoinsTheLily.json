In her new role, she will assist in the daily production and editing duties of The Lily, help manage our social channels and work on Lily Lines, our newsletter.\nNneka comes to us from the Chicago Tribune, where she ran the real estate and homes section. While there, she oversaw the production of the section’s print and digital stories, and worked closely with a team of reporters, photographers and designers, covering issues such as gentrification, neighborhood development and housing discrimination. During her time at the Tribune she also wrote for other sections at the paper, covering a wide range of subjects that included dating online while black, violence in Chicago and the challenges of being a stepparent.\nShe’s also worked at NBC Nightly News, NPR and StayWell, and is a 2011 graduate of Columbia University. Nneka is an avid watcher of British drama series, will never say no to tapas and fervently hopes to one day keep a houseplant alive. She’s excited to spend an excessive amount of time exploring the Smithsonian museums.\nHer first day is Aug. 27. Please join us in welcoming her to The Post.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2018/08/23/nneka-mcguire-joins-the-lily/"}
