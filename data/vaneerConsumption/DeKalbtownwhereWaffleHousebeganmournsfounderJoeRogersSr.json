The pair had met when Rogers bought a house from Forkner, who was in the real estate business.\nThey decided Avondale Estates needed a 24-hour restaurant. It launched Labor Day 1955.\nThen everywhere else needed a 24-hour diner, and the pair was happy to oblige. They grew the business to hundreds of restaurants by the time they phased themselves out of the day-to-day in the late 1970s.\nThey kept coming to the office for many years, until just a few years ago.\nNow there are 1,900 Waffle Houses across the country.\n“The city of Avondale is very proud it began here,” Elmore said. “Waffle House 1,000 is here. We’e very proud of that. We’re very happy they renovated the original Waffle House and turned it into a museum.”\nThe company is now based in Norcross, but Avondale Estates holds as the hometown of the iconic chain.\nCity leaders haven’t had a chance to discuss what they might do to honor Rogers.\nBut they will do something. Rogers and Forkner, who is now 99, did too much for the city.\nOfficials feel it even today when they’re promoting the Avondale Estates.\n“(Being) the birth place of Waffle House is one of the top three things we brag about,” Elmore said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/dekalb-town-where-waffle-house-began-mourns-founder-joe-rogers/y4A5eEciTjD0XVCaTwzOJL/"}
