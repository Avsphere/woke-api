Today under cross examination James Laddie QC, representing Balyasny, pointed out that Mr Newton had lost $10million, having made $12million the year before. He put to the claimant he was trying to extort his former employer out of money, which Mr Newton denied. Central London Employment Tribunal was taken to the transcript of a phone call between Mr Newton and the head of HR after he was fired from the company in June 2016. In the phone call he mentioned he had been seeking legal advice about possible action against the firm. Asked how long he had been seeking legal advice Mr Newton said: 'About a month before I saw a solicitor a friend had recommended to me.' Mr Laddie said: 'So you thought the writing was on the wall?' The claimant said: 'Absolutely. I saw people being interviewed for my job. Clearly it was obviously decided from that point I was likely to be replaced.' Mr Laddie pointed out during the phone call Mr Newton made threats to talk to the media about his alleged abuse and said the company would have to 'sign a big cheque'. The claimant said: 'I was trying to get the firm to change its ways. I had complained about what was happening. I had reported the situation and no changes had been made. 'It was a threat, but I was trying to get them to change their ways.' Mr Laddie said: 'I think you were interested in money and the lever you were pulling at was the threat of going public.' Mr Newton said: 'Money is the only language these people understand.'\nBut he told the tribunal: 'I have never acted in an ostentatious or extravagant effeminate manner.\n'I have never intentionally drawn attention to my sexuality in a way often associated with the gay community at all.'\nMr Newton detailed some of the alleged homophobic abuse he received in the office from several colleagues.\nDescribing one incident in his witness statement he said: 'I was walking past a colleague's desk and he shouted 'cock jockey' behind me.\n'I turned round to him and glared at him. This work colleague later came to my office to apologise but I wasn't having any of it. I told him I was sick of his homophobic behaviour.\n'He replied that he was not homophobic and could prove it because he had a transvestite or transsexual housekeeper. I told him to go away in fairly strong terms.'\nMr Newton, who has 20 years' experience working in the City, was fired last June.\nHe claimed no reason was given at the time but six weeks later the firm blamed poor performance and losses he suffered in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum vote.\nYet, he claims, other straight, male managers who lost more money kept their jobs.\nHe is now suing his former employers for unfair dismissal, arguing his sacking was actually the culmination of a campaign of homophobic abuse that started almost as soon as he joined in March 2014.\nMr Newton, who lives in a Thameside apartment near Tower Bridge, say he has decided to change careers since his departure from the firm, and hopes to work as a barrister in the future.\nBut the firm is fighting his claims, saying they are 'without merit', and insists it is well known in the industry for having a 'collaborative, collegial culture.'\nThe qualified Chartered Accountant and Chartered Tax Advisor Mr Newton claims he was 'subjected to unrelenting abuse based on his sexual orientation by his colleagues, within an environment suffused with homophobia.'\nHe says he 'was forced to work in an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for individuals with his sexual orientation', and argues the culmination of more than two years of hostility was his sacking, without warning and with just two weeks' severance pay.\nThe tribunal also heard Mr Newton felt he was discriminated against when he first joined the company because he was made to sit among other staff on the trading floor instead of getting his own office.\nHe said: 'I complained that I couldn't do the job.' In just over a week of his employment he was given an office with a full length mirror, by the firm, 'to look smart for meetings'.\nHe said: 'It was not furnished to my design. It was a mirror on the wall instead of a picture on the wall.'\nHe is seeking an admission by the hedge fund that he was harassed and discriminated against, an acceptance that he was unlawfully dismissed, and damages for the effects of his alleged treatment.\nMr Newton says in the witness statement that he has been diagnosed as suffering from anxiety and depression since his dismissal.\nBalyasny Asset Management, said in a statement it is 'committed, by policy and ethical commitment, to a workforce free from harassment.'\n'We take seriously any allegations of a hostile work environment and believe these allegations are without merit.,' it added.\nThe hearing, at Central London Employment Tribunals, continues.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319670/Gay-fund-manager-sues-homophobic-campaign-work.html"}
