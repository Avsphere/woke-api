The bus rolled about 200 meters (650 feet) down a slope before crashing into the Pasagad river.\nLocal villagers helped police and soldiers pull the bodies and the injured from the wreckage.\nPoudel said rescue helicopters reached the accident area late Thursday and were able to fly 18 of the injured to a hospital in Nepalgunj city.\nAnother eight injured people were being flown out on Friday but had to wait for the weather to clear up.\nAccidents in Nepal are mostly blamed on poorly maintained roads and vehicle conditions. The country is covered by mountains and the roads are also usually narrow.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4299746/24-killed-bus-accident-Nepal.html"}
