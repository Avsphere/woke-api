Dove ODed in March and pleaded no contest to child endangering\nOverdose: Both Dove and his wife Paula Smith (left, with their daughter) overdosed at the same time. Their little girl then had to call 911 and guide emergency services to their location\nDove blamed his criminal record on addiction and asked to be sent to an out-of-state rehabilitation program that he'd found, saying it would help him clean up.\nBut Rucker refused, telling him: 'A great program, the most effective program, doesn't mean anything if the person doesn't want to take advantage of it.'\nDove was sentenced to 12 months behind bars, where he will serve a prison-based rehabilitation program.\nHe and his wife, Paula Smith, 41, lost consciousness after taking heroin while she was driving their car on March 18.\nHe was in the passenger seat; Smith managed to pull over in a parking lot before losing consciousness.\nThat left their daughter, who was in the back seat to call for help.\nIn a heartbreaking recording, the girl can be heard telling the operator: 'Yeah, they're both breathing.'\n'OK, OK, but you're unable to wake them up?' the operator asks.\n'No, they died and they won't wake up,' the girl says. She was able to identify landmarks to point emergency services to their location.\nSentenced: Dove was given 12 months in prison, where he will undergo rehab. His wife's case is still ongoing. Rucker said he didn't understand how Dove could endanger his daughter\nThe couple were revived after emergency crews administered overdose reversal drug Narcan. Dove had a stent put in his heart.\nOn April 10, Dove pleaded no contest to a charge of child endangering.\nAs well as the 12-month sentence he will also serve a three-to-four-month sentence on a probation violation in Kentucky.\nSmith was charged with endangering children, operating a vehicle under the influence, refusal of a chemical test and possession of an open container. Her case continues.\nThis is the latest in a string of high-profile stories about the opioid epidemic sweeping America.\nOn Friday a Wisconsin mom who crashed her car after overdosing said that a viral video of her collapsed gave her the push she needed to give up drugs.\nThat same day Susan Schorpen, the mother of 11-year-old murder victim Carlie Brucia, was reported dead of a suspected heroin overdose.\nAnd he day before, a Milwaukee couple were arrested after their four-year-old son overdosed on either heroin or pain pills.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446158/Judge-blasts-Ohio-dad-ODed-daughter-9.html"}
