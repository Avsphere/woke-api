Spelman is brimming with talented admitted students who have distinguished themselves as leaders, high academic performers and change agents,\" Mary Schmidt Campbell, president of Spelman College said via email. \"Nonetheless, they face very real financial barriers to attendance. Her gift opens a door to a transformative Spelman experience for at least one of them.
