Though an extraordinarily narrow majority, it will still be a majority, which means that the new Speaker of the House will be a Republican, not a Democrat.\nHere is the math:\nRepublicans currently have 154 safe seats. Adding 61 holds and 3 flips from the Democrats to those safe seats will result in 218 Republican seats in the 116th Congress.\nThe Democrats currently have 181 safe seats. Adding 11 holds and 25 flips from Republicans to those safe seats will result in 217 Democrat seats in the 116th Congress.\nShould the Republicans fail to keep these 61 seats and flip three from Democrat to Republican control, the new Speaker of the House in January will be a Democrat.\nDespite what some Democrat candidates are saying on the campaign trail now, the odds-on favorite to be named Speaker should they regain the majority is still current House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\nThere is little doubt that her first order of business as Speaker will be to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump, another tactic in the unceasing efforts of the Democrat Party to delegitimize the results of the 2016 Presidential election.\nWhile keeping 61 competitive House seats in Republican hands may seem like a daunting task, there are two important points to consider: (1) It is no more daunting than the task faced by the Trump campaign in securing an electoral college victory in the 2016 Presidential election. (2) It is the perfect warmup in a number of key battleground states for what is expected to be a hard fought 2020 Presidential election.\nWith that in mind, Breitbart News has prepared this list of 61 MUST WIN Republican held-house seats and three MUST FLIP Democrat-held House seats, organized by state:\nFlorida: MUST WIN 7\nCD-06 Open (Likely)\nCD-15 Open (Likely)\nCD-16 Buchanan (Lean)\nCD-18 Mast (Lean)\nCD-25 Diaz-Balart (Likely)\nCD-26 Curbelo (Toss-up)\nCD-27 Open (Lean D)\nOhio: MUST WIN 5\nCD-01 Chabot (Lean)\nCD-10 Turner (Likely)\nCD-12 Open (Toss-up)\nCD-14 Joyce (Likely)\nCD-15 Stiver (Likely)\nCalifornia: MUST WIN 4\nCD-04 McClintock (Likely)\nCD-21 Valadao (Likely)\nCD-45 Walters (Lean)\nCD-48 Rohrbacher (Toss-up)\nNew York: MUST WIN 4\nCD-01 Zeldin (Likely)\nCD-11 Donovan (Likely)\nCD-22 Tenney (Toss-up)\nCD-24 Katko (Likely)\nNorth Carolina: MUST WIN 4\nCD-02 Holding (Likely)\nCD-08 Hudson (Likely)\nCD-09 Open (Lean)\nCD-13 Budd (Lean)\nTexas: MUST WIN 4\nCD-07 Culberson (Toss-up)\nCD-21 Open (Likely)\nCD-23 Hurd (Lean)\nCD-31 Carter (Likely)\nMinnesota: MUST WIN 2, MUST FLIP 2\nCD-1 Open (Toss-up) MUST FLIP from D to R\nCD-2 Lewis (Toss-up)\nCD-3 Paulsen (Toss-up)\nCD-8 Open (Toss-up) MUST FLIP from D to R\nMichigan: MUST WIN 3\nCD-01 Berman (Likely)\nCD-06 Upton (Likely)\nCD-07 Walberg (Likely)\nPennsylvania: MUST WIN 3 MUST FLIP 1\nCD-01 Fitzpatrick (Lean)\nCD-10 Perry (Likely)\nCD-14 Open (Likely R) MUST FLIP from R to D\nCD-16 Kelly (Lean)\nVirginia MUST WIN 3\nCD-02 Taylor (Lean)\nCD-05 Open (Lean)\nCD-07 Brat (Toss-up)\nGeorgia: MUST WIN 2\nCD-07 Woodall (Likely)\nCD-06 Handel (Lean)\nKansas: MUST WIN 2\nCD-02 Open (Lean)\nCD-03 Yoder (Lean)\nIllinois: MUST WIN 2\nCD-13 Davis (Lean)\nCD-14 Hultgen (Lean)\nWashington: MUST WIN 2\nCD-03 Herrera-Beutler (Likely)\nCD-05 McMorris Rodgers (Lean)\nWisconsin: MUST WIN 2\nCD-01 Open (Lean)\nCD-06 Grothman (Likely)\nArizona: MUST WIN 1\nCD-06 Schweikert (Likely)\nArkansas: MUST WIN 1\nCD-02 Hill (Lean)\nColorado: MUST WIN 1\nCD-03 Tipton (Likely)\nIndiana: MUST WIN 1\nCD-02 Walinski (Likely)\nMissouri: MUST WIN 1\nCD-02 Wagner (Likely)\nMontana: MUST WIN 1\nCD-At Large Gianforte (Lean)\nNebraska: MUST WIN 1\nCD-02 Bacon (Lean)\nNew Jersey: MUST WIN 1\nCD-03 MacArthur (Lean)\nNew Mexico: MUST WIN 1\nCD-02 Open (Lean)\nSouth Carolina: MUST WIN 1\nCD-01 Open (Likely)\nUtah: MUST WIN 1\nCD-04 Love (Lean)\nWest Virginia: MUST WIN 1\nCD-03 Open (Lean)\n(Note: District ratings align with the current House seat ratings from the Cook Political Report.
