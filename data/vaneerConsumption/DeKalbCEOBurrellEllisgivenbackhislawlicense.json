The state’s highest court threw out those convictions Nov. 30, ruling that Ellis hadn’t received a fair trial.\nIf the guilty verdicts had been upheld, he could have been disbarred.\nEllis has been suspended from office since he was indicted in July 2013, and he served eight months in prison after his conviction in July 2015.\nIncoming DeKalb District Attorney Sherry Boston will decide whether to seek a retrial when she takes office next month.\nVoters elected Mike Thurmond as DeKalb’s next CEO for a four-year term starting in January.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/dekalb-ceo-burrell-ellis-given-back-his-law-license/xXlYO2fKHGAsHIuJTig0VK/"}
