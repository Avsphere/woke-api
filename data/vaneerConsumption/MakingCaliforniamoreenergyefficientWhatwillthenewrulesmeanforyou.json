Other reductions will be made in new construction, under “greener” building codes.\nWhat will these changes cost, in a state already short on affordable housing? And how will we pay for them? Will the government help defray the expense?\nThe devil may be in the details.\nWill your kitchen redo be more expensive? Will everyone abide by the new standards? Who will make sure homeowners and businesses are complying?\nWhat, in the end, will the effect be on California’s carbon footprint?","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/making-california-more-energy-efficient-what-will-the-new-rules-mean-for-you/"}
