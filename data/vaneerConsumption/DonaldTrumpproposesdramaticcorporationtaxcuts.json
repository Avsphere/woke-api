This would include deductions for state and local tax payments, a change that could alienate support from politicians in states such as California and New York with higher state taxes.\n“It’s not the federal government’s job to be subsidising the states,” Mr Mnuchin said.\nThe administration has emphasised that the plan was focused on simplifying the tax code and helping middle class Americans. The median US household income is slightly above 50,000 dollars (£39,000) annually.\nStill, the proposal could reduce the tax burden for the wealthy as well. It would also repeal the estate tax, the catch-all alternative minimum tax and the 3.8% tax on investment income from President Barack Obama’s health care law. The proposal has yet to be vetted for its precise impact on top earners, as several details are still being determined.\nOn the corporate side, the top marginal tax rate would fall from 35% to 15%. Small businesses that account for their owners’ personal incomes would see their top tax rate go from 39.6% to the proposed corporate tax rate of 15%.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4447830/Treasury-chief-says-Trump-s-tax-reform-largest-US-history.html"}
