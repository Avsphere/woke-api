Soon afterwards, Slender Man became a popular presence in online stories and spooky YouTube videos, turning it into a bogeyman familiar to many kids who spend time on the Internet.\nKnudsen responded on Wednesday to the media attention centered around his creation.\nâ€œI am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act,\" he said in a statement to the media.\nHis publicist wrote that Knudsen would be giving no media interviews on the topic.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/slender-man-stabbing/slender-man-creator-speaks-stabbing-i-am-deeply-saddened-n122781"}
