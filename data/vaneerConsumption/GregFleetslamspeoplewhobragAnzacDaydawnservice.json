You are not a hero. You are someone who owns an alarm clock.'\nMelbourne based comedian and actor Greg Fleet (pictured) ridiculed people for bragging about going to Anzac Day ceremonies on Tuesday\nThe former 2-day FM breakfast show presenter was slammed by followers who disagreed with his opinion.\n'Should people not attend these services or not post they attend these services? Should people not feel proud to post, share, state they are proud to be Australia?' one man said.\n'It is about support in any capacity. The whole theme of Remembrance Day is Lest We Forget. I am proud of the way Australia treats this day and the whole point is we can never repay them, but we can remember them and honour them.'\n'Lost you forgot... about the veterans and their families who appreciate the attention,' a second man said.\nGreg Fleet (pictured) was slammed by followers who disagreed with his sentiment\nMr Fleet, who has appeared in Neighbours and The Flying Doctors, said he was 'all for remembering and honouring' but condemned people who gloated about their participation in the day's events.\n'I'm not all for the c***s who try to use this day to say \"hey, I'm more respectful and Aussie than you are\",' he said.\n'There is no honour in bragging, there is honour in quietly doing.'\nPeople gather at the Cenotaph following the Sydney Dawn Service on April 25, 2017 in Sydney\nOne follower said social media was so ingrained in everyday life that online posts were simply part of 'the world we live in now'.\n'Like when they go to to the gym or post a photo of their lunch. It doesn't always mean they are trying to score points or be a hero,' they said.\nMr Fleet, who has been open about his long-term battle with heroin and methamphetamine addiction, hit back.\n'F*** off. You are equating a status update about lunch with nationalistic bragging and the appropriation of the bravery and sacrifice of others. If you actually mean that you are either extremely dumb or have lost your mind,' he said.\nThe attention prompted Mr Fleet to address the controversial post and issue an explanation\nOthers agreed with Mr Fleet and said the hype surrounding Anzac Day detracted from its significance.\n'For me it's a day of quiet reflection,'\nOne woman simply said 'wonderful post'.\nThe controversial post garnered more than 400 likes and comments within 24 hours.\nThe overwhelming attention prompted Mr Fleet to address the post and issue an explanation.\n'Respect rarely involves boasting. How about not posting about doing it, and just doing it quietly and respectful? Anzac Day was never meant to be a competition to see who was the \"most Australian\",' he said.\n'Shouting on Facebook about how you are more solemn than someone else because you got up and watched actual heroes walk down a road is not actually heroic, and it is about as respectful as taking a selfie over a grave.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4445884/Greg-Fleet-slams-people-brag-Anzac-Day-dawn-service.html"}
