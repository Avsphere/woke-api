Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, helped Hallman obtain the update. Brown says an estimated 100,000 Americans have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation since World War II and often lost benefits they had earned.\nBrown co-sponsored federal legislation to help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records and receive reinstated benefits.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422255/Gay-veteran-kicked-Army-receives-honorable-discharge.html"}
