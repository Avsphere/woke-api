Penney in Cumberland Mall, said at the time.\nBattery sales were up 300 percent.\nA staff photo from a Jan. 19, 1977, edition of The Atlanta Constitution showing snow and traffic on I-75 south in Forsyth County. (AJC Archives)\nFactories and schools throughout metro Atlanta closed after pleas from natural gas suppliers. There wasn't enough gas to heat everyone and everything.\nGov. George Busbee asked all Georgians to reduce their thermostats by three degrees.\n-0.6 degrees on Dec. 13, 1962\nTwo days after that record temperature was recorded, The Atlanta Constitution published a story saying 25 people statewide had been killed in weather-related incidents.\nMost of the deaths were caused by fires. Cars failed all over Georgia, causing numerous traffic tie-ups and wrecks.\nAt the time, it was the \"bitterest cold wave ever to strike Georgia in December,\" The Atlanta Constitution wrote.\nCracked pipes and folks without water for days was the norm in metro Atlanta.\nA staff photo from a Dec. 14, 1962, edition of The Atlanta Constitution. (AJC Archives)\n-2.6 degrees on Jan. 30, 1966\nTwo Marietta boys, ages 5 and 7, went out to play and went missing that day.\nA search party of 75 people battled subfreezing temperatures for six hours to find the boys. They found them 2Â½ miles from their home.\nThey were rushed to Kennestone Hospital as a precaution. By the time they were found at 4 p.m., the temperature was 25 degrees and rapidly dropping.\nThe day after the record, there were 30 to 40 Dallas homes reported without natural gas for a few hours.\n\"The shortage was caused by unprecedented demand on our system,\" Tom Lee, the manager of the city's gas company told The Atlanta Constitution.\nA photo from Jan. 30, 1966 editions of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution. (AJC Archives)\nHe said they \"took precautionary steps to see that adequate gas pressure was maintained for two local hospitals and two local nursing homes.\"\nAn Austell gas company asked its residential and commercial customers to limit gas use.\nSpokesman Art Latimer said \"his company's system was not designed for weather under 10 degrees.\"\n-2.7 degrees on Jan. 21, 1985\nLike the mercury, crime was also low.\n\"Criminals are just like everyone else, apparently, they want to say out of bad weather, said Bob Hightower, Cobb's public safety commissioner.\nHe made another astute observation: \"Not too many police agencies will have that many robberies or other major crimes. We will see an increase in assaults, however, if people are trapped in their houses for a few days.\"\nA Cobb police lieutenant said there were six burglaries over the weekend leading into the Monday temperature record. That's about half of what they usually saw.\nIt seems people also weren't fishing.\nIce formed on Little River, which connects to Allatoona Lake, when the temperature reached 14 a fisherman told the newspaper.\nThe low in Anchorage, Alaska, about the same time was 27 degrees.\nThe owner at Mableton's Battery Warehouse & Supply Co. said he'd sold more than 300 car batteries that day.\nThe next day he sold 200.\nHe said he had to turn away people pounding at the doors.\nA staff photo from a Jan. 25, 1963, edition of The Atlanta Constitution. (AJC Archives)\n-3.6 degrees on Jan. 24, 1963\nThe Atlanta Constitution called \"Georgia's arctic winter storm\" the \"worst this century.\"\nFour people died on icy roads in the state, the newspaper reported the day of the record.\nCobb's was the only school system in metro Atlanta that closed its schools the day after the record.\nLike Cobb County News Now on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter and Instagram\nOn Jan. 29, the newspaper ran a wire story with a headline of \"167 Dead in U.S. As Arctic Wave Tightens Grip.\"\nA 20-mile section of the Mississippi froze. Some cities saw more than a hundred inches of snow over a few days.\nIn case you were wondering, the lowest low in Atlanta's history was -9 on Feb. 13, 1899.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/what-are-the-coldest-days-the-history-cobb-county/PC9GYVT9IasR5aHDcQTuuJ/"}
