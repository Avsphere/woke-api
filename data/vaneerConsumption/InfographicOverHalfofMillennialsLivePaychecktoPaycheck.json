The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nPresident Obama signed an executive order Monday that will allow five million additional student-loan borrowers to put a ceiling on their monthly payment plans. The measure is an expansion of a 2010 law, and some question whether these changes go far enough in easing student-loan debt, which now tops $1.2 trillion.\nFour in 10 millennials say they are overwhelmed by debt, and student loans are their biggest financial concern, a study by Wells Fargo found.
