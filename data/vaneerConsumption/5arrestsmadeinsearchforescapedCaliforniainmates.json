Five people have been arrested in connection to their escapes\nThis undated combo photo provided by the Orange County Sheriff's Office shows tattoos and other markings on the body of Duong, one of three inmates who escaped on Friday\nHutchens would only say they had 'some connection' to the inmates, adding that providing more information might tip off the inmates to details of the search. The department is still investigating whether the men had help on the inside, she said.\nHossein Nayeri, 37, Bac Duong, 43, and Jonathan Tieu, 20, escaped last week by cutting through a grate, climbing through plumbing tunnels and rappelling to the ground from the roof.\nThe men would have needed powerful cutting tools that would not have been available to them inside to get through thick metal, and investigators are looking into how they could have obtained them, Hutchens said.\n'We don't know what they are, but we know that they made a clean cut,' Hutchens said of the tools the men used. 'It's nothing we think could have occurred with a jail-made shank.'\nTo carry out such an elaborate escape, the men likely were given blueprints or told how the bowels of the jail were laid out, said Kevin Tamez, a managing partner for MPM Group, a firm that consults on prison security, management and infrastructure.\nAuthorities with the Orange County Central Jail stand on the top jail floor in Santa Ana, California, on Tuesday\nA wanted sign is displayed for the The reward for information leading to the arrest of the the three escaped inmates from the Orange County Central Men's Jail\nThis undated photo provided by the Orange County Sheriff's Office shows an earlier photo of 43-year-old Bac Duong\nIt's unclear how jail officials didn't detect anything inside the dorm where the men were housed with about 60 other inmates. Hallock said the jail's policy is to do walk-throughs every hour, and more involved searches are done at random.\nThe jail has revised its headcount procedures because it took so long to discover the men were missing. The changes include requiring deputies to call and confirm that inmates who are in court, getting medical help or otherwise out of the jail are actually where they are supposed to be.\nThe men escaped Friday from the jail after cutting a hole in a metal grate then crawling through plumbing tunnels and onto the roof. They pushed aside barbed wire and rappelled down using a rope made of bed sheets.\n'It's every sheriff's nightmare,' Hutchens said. 'You never want to have an escape from any jail. They do happen. And you certainly don't want maximum security prisoners who are a danger to the public to get out of your jail. So it's not a good day.'\nTieu, Duong and Nayeri had all been awaiting trial for unrelated violent crimes.\nNayeri was probably the mastermind of the escape, Hutchens said, saying his sophistication, his military past and a history of fleeing from law enforcement have investigators focusing on his role.\nHe is charged with kidnapping and torture in a 2012 attack on a marijuana dispensary owner to learn where he might have buried large sums of money. Nayeri fled to Iran and was arrested by authorities in Prague on his way to visit family.\nDuong is charged with attempted murder in the November shooting of a man in Santa Ana.\nThe vent screen (above) had been cut and removed from the inside of the jail cell where the three men escaped from sometime on Friday, January 22\nAbove is pictured the jail cell and vent screen that had been cut, near the floor at center rear, inside of the Central Men's Jail in Santa Ana, California by the three inmates\nHe has done several stints in federal prison for burglary and drug charges and is the subject of a 1998 deportation order that authorities have not carried out because Vietnam has not provided the required paperwork to take him back.\nTieu is charged with murder, attempted murder and other crimes in a 2011 gang shooting outside a pool hall in Garden Grove. He was 15 at the time of the shooting and was transferred to the men's jail when he turned 18.\nAuthorities said the men were last seen at a 5am headcount on Friday. They were determined to be missing roughly 16 hours later at an evening headcount.\nIn addition to those two counts, jail personnel check the number of inmates against jail records at three other points during the day, Hallock said. He said investigators have detected some problems with how counts were conducted in this instance.\nThe search has centered on a Vietnamese gang based in nearby Westminster and Garden Grove, where the other two inmates have ties.\nSheriff's authorities said they believe at least two of the men, Tieu and Duong, may be hiding among Orange County's sizable Vietnamese community.\nThe sheriff appeared on television and radio shows in Orange County's Little Saigon early in the day to ask for help from the Vietnamese community, one of the nation's largest..\nFederal and county officials are offering a combined $200,000 reward for the men's capture.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3420415/Five-arrests-search-escaped-California-inmates-remain-large-police-center-local-Vietnamese-gang.html"}
