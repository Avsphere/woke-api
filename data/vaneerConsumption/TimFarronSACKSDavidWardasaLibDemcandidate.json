As well as being sacked he has been suspended from the party.\nMr Ward hit back this afternoon, claiming he felt 'real and deep sadness' at his sacking, insisting this 'anti-Semitic thing is a nonsense'.\nMr Ward has been suspended from the party over anti-Semitism allegations in the past but was a full party member eligible to stand when the snap election was called.\nHe was kicked out of Parliament by Bradford East voters in 2015 and had hoped to fight to reclaim his seat.\nBut after the selection was condemned by Prime Minister Theresa May at PMQs, Mr Farron axed Mr Ward this afternoon.\nTim Farron (pictured today campaigning in Cornwall) has sacked David Ward as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Bradford East after a storm over his anti-Semitic remarks\nDavid Ward (pictured right with Nick Clegg and Vince Cable in 2010) was the Lib Dem MP for Bradford East between 2010 and 2015\nThe Lib Dem leader said: 'I believe in a politics that is open, tolerant and united. David Ward is unfit to represent the party and I have sacked him.'\nAt a campaign rally earlier, Mr Farron had said the selection was wrong but said it was not his job to choose candidates.\nHe said the Bradford East Lib Dems had made a mistake that he expected the party to 'act quickly and decisively'.\nLiberal Democrat sources said Mr Farron had acted swiftly in line with his powers during a snap election.\nMr Ward's case will be considered by a party committee but he has no prospect of winning a place on the ballot paper on June 8 via an appeal.\nDavid Ward (file picture) has been suspended from the party over anti-Semitism allegations in the past\nMr Ward said: 'The anti-Semitic thing is a nonsense. It is just used, it's a well known tactic, how do you avoid conversation or any criticism about Israel? Just say people are anti-Semitic.'\n'I am certainly not anti-Semitic.'\nMr Ward said his criticism was focused only on the actions of Israel, not Jews.\n'I would defy anybody to find any comment I have ever made which is not solely related to what Israel is doing,' he added.\n'This is all about one thing, let's shut down debate.'\nMr Ward said it was a 'huge disappointment' that Mr Farron had taken the decision to sack him.\nAsked why the leader axed him, he replied: 'Just the pressure that they come under, all the party's come under, and it works. The pressure works.\n'It's the fear of the electoral damage that can be done by being seen to oppose Israel. It's contaminating and infecting our own political system.'\nPrime Minister Theresa May condemned the selection of Mr Ward at PMQs hours before Mr Farron axed him as a candidate\nAt PMQs today, Mrs May said: 'People will be, I think, rightly disappointed to see the Liberal Democrats re-adopt a candidate with a questionable record on anti-Semitism.\n'It is important that all parties maintain the strongest possible censure on all forms of intolerance and send that message to our communities.'\nHer comments came in response to a question from former minister Eric Pickles, who said party leaders must do more than 'pay lip service' to tackling anti-Semitism.\nJoe Glasman, of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said: 'Mr Farron deserves no credit for allowing the selection of such unsuitable candidates, then claiming to be powerless to intervene, then sacking them. They should never have been selected at all.\n'It is a great shame that Tim Farron only seems to act on anti-Semitism when enough people are watching.'\nMr Farron, who has distanced himself from Mr Ward's remarks, previously told the Commons Home Affairs Committee's anti-Semitism inquiry that the ex-MP had 'served his time'.\nMr Ward was suspended in 2013 after a series of scandals over anti-Semitic remarks.\nHe compared the Holocaust to the actions of the Israeli government and referred to Israel as an 'apartheid' state.\nIn July 2014, he suggested support for terrorists firing rockets into Israel from Gaza, saying he would 'probably' do the same.\nMr Farron will hope his swift action will not distract from the Lib Dems campaign, which has already been rocked by questions over his own beliefs about gay people.\nThe Lib Dem leader campaigned in Cornwall this morning, urging businesses in St Albans to 'dump the Tories'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447928/Tim-Farron-SACKS-David-Ward-Lib-Dem-candidate.html"}
