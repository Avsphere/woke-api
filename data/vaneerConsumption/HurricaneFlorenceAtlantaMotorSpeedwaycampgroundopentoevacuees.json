Those three states and Maryland have declared states of emergency as the Category 4 storm makes its way toward land.\nAtlanta Motor Speedway, located in Henry County, announced Tuesday it would open its campgrounds for evacuees trying to escape Hurricane Florence’s path.\nFor folks using dry RVs and tents, space to camp at the speedway’s Legends Campgrounds is free. Near the campground is the Rinnai Shower Station, which will give evacuees free access to hot showers and restrooms during their stay. The campground is equipped to handle “thousands” of campers, the speedway says.\nFor $20 per day, the speedway also has a limited number of camping spaces with water, power and sewer hookups in its “premier campground.”\nAlso, pets are allowed to stay too, free of charge, according to the speedway’s Twitter account.\nPAST COVERAGE: A NASCAR track is providing a home for Hurricane Irma evacuees\nOur President and GM, @EdClarkAMS speaks about our plans to assist those evacuating from #HurricaneFlorence pic.twitter.com/OWleIwVuSP — Atlanta Motor Speedway (@amsupdates) September 11, 2018\nREAD | Hurricane Florence: Category 4 storm becoming better organized, increasing in size\nREAD | Georgia DOT prepares for Hurricane Florence\nREAD | A look at some of Georgia's worst hurricanes\nSome evacuees have already arrived at the speedway. Melody Rawson of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, drove down in her red Dodge Caravan on Wednesday morning. She — along with three other adults, her son in a wheelchair, two dogs and a bird — left her first floor apartment around 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Rawson said the family lives about 10 minutes from the ocean.\nBut Rawson’s trip from Myrtle Beach to Henry County wasn’t easy. She said the van got a flat tire on I-20 Tuesday night. After fixing it, the family arrived around 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday.\n“We’re going to pitch a tent and pray for no rain,” Rawson said. “If it doesn’t rain, we’ll be comfortable. If it rains, I don’t know what’s going to happen because I don’t want to camp in the rain. So, we’ll see.”\nThe NASCAR track hosted more than 100 evacuees from Florida for several days last year when Hurricane Irma threatened the Sunshine State.\nThe speedway was built in 1960 and its president, Ed Clark, remembers evacuees first coming to the track’s campgrounds in 2004, when Floridians were trying to escape Hurricane Frances.\n“We did it that time,” Clark told the AJC last year. “And going forward, anytime there’s been a storm, folks will call us and it’s an automatic yes. It’s easy for us to do. We got 843 acres.”\nDirections to the speedway and a detailed map are available on its website.
