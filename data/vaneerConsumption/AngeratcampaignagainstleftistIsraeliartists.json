It said Sobol \"stood proudly\" in the \"battle against the culture minister.\"\nHowever Culture Minister Miri Regev, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud party, herself spoke out against Im Tirtzu's campaign.\n\"Alongside the public's right to know, we must refrain from statements that could lead to incitement and violence. Hurting any person because of their political opinions is wrong,\" she wrote on Facebook.\n-'Fascist, ugly and dangerous'-\nLikud MP Benny Begin, son of late prime minister Menachem Begin, called the Im Tirtzu offensive a \"new level of ugly\".\n\"There's an attempt here to plant in the public's mind the term 'moles' as a synonym for 'traitors',\" he said on public radio.\n\"Seeking out, locating and marking supposed traitors is an old fascist trait, both ugly and dangerous,\" he added.\nIsaac Herzog, head of the opposition Labour party, said that \"McCarthyism is making a despicable attempt to take over Israel\" but \"the Israeli McCarthyism and the lowlifes leading it will disappear, like they did from the United States.\"\nThe Association for Civil Rights in Israel said Im Tirtzu's attack on artists and intellectuals came after it had previously targeted academics and human rights activists.\n\"The infamous Senator Joseph McCarthy is a cultural hero in the eyes of Im Tirtzu,\" ACRI said in a statement. \"But the real cultural heroes are human rights activists, intellectuals and artists who stand up to protect human rights and are not deterred from fighting against human rights violations.\"\nMcCarthyism refers to allegations of treason or subversion without proof, and was coined after the former US senator's anti-communist witch-hunts from the late 1940s to the 1950s.\nIm Tirtzu's latest broadside coincides with a row over a bill proposed by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked targeting leftwing NGOs that the United States has warned could have \"chilling\" repercussions.\nThe bill demands that NGOs receiving more than half of their funding from foreign governments declare it in all their official reports, while their representatives should wear a special badge during visits to parliament.\nAnd Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who leads Shaked's far-right Jewish Home party, has ordered a number of changes in the school curriculum which have alarmed the left.\nBoth minsters criticised Im Tirtzu's crusade, with Bennett calling it \"embarrassing, unnecessary and degrading\" in a tweet, and Shaked telling army radio that \"artists with leftwing opinions shouldn't be considered 'moles' or demonised.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3421571/Anger-campaign-against-leftist-Israeli-artists.html"}
