The whole thing spins forward, taking the weight off the current spoke or leg and passing it to the next. But before the first spoke leaves the ground, it gives a little push, propelling the robot forward. It's actually a bit like how we run — except for the extra four legs.\nSpinning keeps it stable, like a bike, and you can steer it with a controller or smartphone app. The \"core\" version lasts an hour and runs up to 10 mph, but the inevitable \"performance\" version lasts twice as long and runs twice as fast. That's more than enough to leave the average runner in the dust.\nIn fact, during testing, the OutRunner broke the world speed record for legged robots — 45 mph, faster even than Boston Dynamics' Cheetah, which can hit 29 mph.\nBackers will get a robot starting at the $250 level, but you'll have to shell out $800 if you want the performance edition. That's quite a chunk of change, but this is certainly a unique and powerful robot.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/gift-guide/remote-control-robot-outruns-you-spoke-like-legs-n103476"}
