He will have to have sufficient evidence to overturn the live call. The live call is still up for some debate, it's fairly new so we'll assess it again for another year and look at ways we can improve it.'\nGanson has promoted two referees from the Championship, George Stokes and Sam Ansell, to increase the size of the Super League panel to nine full-time officials and expects the extra competition to bring the best out of them.\n'That's the first time we've had nine referees for six games so we're going to have a bit of room for manoeuvre,' he said.\n'Appointments will be very much based on performances - just like players, referees have got to perform to be in the starting line-up and the ones that don't perform will have to work their way back in.\n'It's a deliberate shift of emphasis. We need the referees not to feel so comfortable that they're guaranteed a spot every week.\n'Their performances will be under scrutiny and I expect high standards.'\nGanson says the system of two referees, which is used in the NRL, remains up for debate but hinted it remains unlikely to be brought into Super League.\n'We'll never discount anything but in Australia the two-referee system is not perfect and senior players like Cameron Smith in the Test matches have actually come out and said they prefer the one-referee system,' he said.\nDefending champions Leeds will kick off the 2016 season against Warrington next Thursday with memories of their dramatic triumphs in 2015 still fresh in the mind and Super League general manager Blake Solly is predicting another tense campaign.\nThe Rhinos helped deliver on the league's pledge to 'make every minute matter' by claiming the League Leaders' Shield with a last-second win at Huddersfield before going on to beat Wigan narrowly in a sold-out Grand Final.\nSolly had staked his reputation on the radical new structure in which Super League and the Championship is split into three divisions after 23 rounds to determine the Grand Finalists and possible relegation through a series of play-offs.\nGanson has promoted two referees to increase the size of the Super League panel to nine full-time officials\n'I am probably a little less nervous than last year because we've seen how good the structure is and how well it can work,' Solly said.\n'I always believed it would be successful but it probably worked even better than I thought it would have done if you think of some of the moments from last year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-3422143/Rugby-League-referees-boss-Steve-Ganson-unveils-plans-make-referees-accountable-performances-2016.html"}
