The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe next death-row inmate scheduled for execution in Oklahoma asked a court Monday for a six-month delay while the investigation of a botched lethal injection unfolds.\nCharles Warner was supposed to be put to death April 29 for the rape and murder of an 11-month-old, but his execution was called off amid the chaos over fellow prisoner Clayton Lockett's death hours earlier.\nLockett, a murderer and rapist, appeared to regain consciousness and writhe in pain several minutes after a new cocktail of drugs was administered.\nState officials later disclosed that they couldn't find an injection site on Lockett's arms or legs and so ran a line through his groin, only to have a vein collapse.\n\"lt appears that Mr. Lockett was never fully sedated by the first drug in Oklahomaâ€™s new protocol before the injection of the excruciatingly painful second and third drugs, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride,\" Warner's lawyers wrote in a petition to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.\nThey noted that it could take months before authorities have a clear picture of what went wrong during Lockett's execution and revise the state's protocol.\nGovernor Mary Fallin has said she would extend her two-week stay of execution if necessary, but defense lawyers note she can only postpone it for up to 60 days.\n\"The state lawfully carried out a sentence of death,\" Fallin said in a statement Monday. \"Justice was served.\"\n\"The people of Oklahoma do not have blood on their hands,\" she added.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/lethal-injection/oklahoma-death-row-inmate-asks-six-month-lethal-injection-delay-n97466"}
