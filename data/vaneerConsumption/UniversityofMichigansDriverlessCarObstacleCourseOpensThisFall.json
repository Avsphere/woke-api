The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe University of Michigan is about to open a sophisticated testing ground for driverless vehicles: 32 acres of streets, highways and common obstacles to put tomorrow's robo-cars through their paces.\nCalled the \"Mobility Transformation Facility,\" the site at the university's North Campus in Ann Arbor will imitate as closely as possible the varied and unpredictable environment we drive through every day. Programmable street lights, simulated construction and (eventually) mechanical pedestrians will thwart driverless vehicles as they roll through.\nThere's even a short four-lane highway so the cars can practice jumping in and out of high-speed traffic.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/university-michigans-driverless-car-obstacle-course-opens-fall-n122901"}
