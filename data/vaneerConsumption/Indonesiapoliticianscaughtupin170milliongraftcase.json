Prosecutors say the rest of the stolen $172 million was distributed among the dozens of other people involved.\nThe justice minister and parliament's speaker are from political parties that have thrown their support behind Jokowi's government, which initially did not command a parliamentary majority following the election of the maverick candidate in 2014.\nTransparency International in 2016 gave Indonesia a corruption score of 37 on a 1 to 100 scale, where 100 is completely free of corruption. Out of the 176 countries ranked, Indonesia was 90th, far from its goal of reaching 50th place by 2016.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4299876/Indonesia-politicians-caught-170-million-graft-case.html"}
