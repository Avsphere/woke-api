Meanwhile, KVEA’s Jaime Sanchez was honored with the Best Editor award, and the station also earned top honors for Sports Series and its regular evening newscast.\nThe dominance of Spanish-language stations at the Emmys underscores California’s demographic shift; as of July 1, Latinos make up a majority of the population in the state.\nAmong other winners, KTLA5 took home five awards, KCAL 9 earned four, CBS2 and NBC4 each won three and ABC7 and KCET won two a piece.\nOn the sports-broadcast front, Time Warner Cable’s SportsNet L.A. won six awards, three for its coverage of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The wins are particularly ironic because most Dodger fans could not watch the baseball games due to contract disputes.\nCheck out the complete list of winners below, courtesy of Deadline.\nOUTSTANDING EDITOR – PROGRAMMING\nANTONIO CAMBEROS, Editor – KMEX\nOUTSTANDING EDITOR – NEWS\nJAIME SANCHEZ, Editor – KVEA\nOUTSTANDING DIRECTOR – PROGRAMMING\nMIKE MAAS, Director – CBS2\nOUTSTANDING DIRECTOR – NEWS\nHORACIO CERVANTES, Director – KMEX\nINSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMMING\nGEOLOGY ACROSS THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE\nEducable Channel 95\nMarie Therese Hulett, Associate Producer\nCHILDREN/YOUTH PROGRAMMING\nCHLA IMAGINE: A CELEBRATION OF HOPE – ABC7\nLorenzo Benet, Producer\nJessica Capshaw, Host\nJim Deeken, Producer\nJanet Dotson, Executive Producer\nDeAnn Marshall, Executive Producer\nChris Mortensen, Producer\nCarol Wong, Executive Producer\nGarson Yu, Executive Producer\nINFORMATION/PUBLIC AFFAIRS SERIES\n(MORE THAN 50% STUDIO)\nENFOQUE LOS ANGELES – KVEA\nElizabeth Chavolla, Producer\nClaudia Forestieri, Producer\nAzucena Gomez, Host\nINFORMATION/PUBLIC AFFAIRS SERIES\n(MORE THAN 50% REMOTE)\n#LAPREPA Time Warner Cable Deportes\nJorge Caridad, Associate Producer\nCarolina Cavaliere, Reporter\nSPORTS SERIES – NEWS\nATLETA DE LA SEMANA – KVEA\nJavier Renovato, Producer\nSaul Rodriguez, Reporter\nOUTSTANDING SPORTS REPORTING\nDIANA ALVARADO, Producer, Reporter – KMEX\nINVESTIGATIVE REPORTING – NEWS\nFRONTERA MILLIONARIA – KMEX\n(Noticias 34 Solo a las Seis)\nAndres Bonilla, Camera\nLeon Krauze, Reporter\nAndres Pruna, Editor, Producer\nOUTSTANDING HARD NEWS REPORTING\nANTONIO R.
