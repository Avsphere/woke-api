I’m good for maybe two hours, but after that, my attention starts to wander and my feet start to hurt; and from there, the rate at which I lose interest grows exponentially with each new painting I mosey on by. (It’s worth noting that this is generally what happens when I go shopping, too, so to any potential new friends out there I haven’t met yet: Consider yourselves warned.) For anyone who’s in the same metaphorical boat as me, though, there’s WTF Renaissance, an online comedy project that pairs great Renaissance works of art with the funniest captions you can possibly imagine revealing the innermost thoughts of each painting’s subjects. So that’s what all those naked reclining women and people in uncomfortably collars were thinking as they glanced coyly at their artists!\nFrom what I’ve been able to deduce, WTF Renaissance began as a Tumblr; its first post hit the Internet just a week and a half ago on August 3, 2014. Its Twitter feed came into existence just two days later on August 5, with the first post there being perhaps the most succinct summation of what the whole thing is about:\nOr is it? I would argue that it most certainly is, because seriously, you guys. I have now spent about 30 minutes looking at every available WTF Renaissance image, and I just can’t stop laughing at this:\nAnd this:\nAnd this:\nAnd this:\nAnd this:\nAnd this:\nAnd… well, you get the idea.\nWTF Renaissance took to Facebook eventually, too, completing the Holy Social Media Trifecta; all it needs to do to completely conquer the Internet is to get on Pinterest, start Instagramming some field trips to museums, and find some way to use Snapchat to its advantage. Really, the possibilities are endless. Just think what a collaboration between WTF Renaissance and Svetlana Petrova of the giant ginger cat pieces might yield!\nImages: WTFRenaissance/Twitter","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35764-wtf-renaissance-reveals-what-the-subjects-of-famous-works-of-art-are-really-thinking"}
