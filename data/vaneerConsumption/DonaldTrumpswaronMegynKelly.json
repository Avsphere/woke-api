Poses like this in GQ Magazine.'\nTrump has cited his long-running feud with Kelly as his reason for skipping Thursday night's prime-time Republican debate on Fox, just four days before the critical Iowa caucuses.\nScroll down for videos\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump tweeted this message (above and below) on Thursday morning\nTrump is locked in a close contest in Iowa with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, with the latest average of major polls showing Trump just 6.5 percentage points ahead, according to Real Clear Politics.\nThe Trump-Kelly feud has grown so intense to Trump that he plans to hold a competing event, benefiting veterans, in Des Moines at the same time as the debate.\nOn Wednesday, Trump criticized Kelly again in an interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, arguing that she was biased against him.\nThe GOP race-leader has sent out numerous tweets criticizing Kelly ever since last August, when the reporter tried to pin him down on allegations of misogyny during the first Republican presidential debate.\nTrump bristled at the debate, but really let fly online, shortly thereafter accusing her of menstruating during the debate - a comment he later said was misinterpreted.\nThe back-and-forth continued up until Wednesday, when Trump shut the door on appearing at the Fox-hosted debate, claiming that the network was biased against him.\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, at left, is battling Trump for the GOP nomination in a close contest in Iowa\nHowever, on Thursday Trump caught flak from his own Twitter followers for his post.\n'I am mortified that you would retweet this,' wrote one follower. 'This is so wrong on multiple levels.'\nAnother follower wrote, 'And this is the man who wants to lead the USA?'\nSome of Trump's other followers posted racy pictures for which his own wife Melania has posed, suggesting that the tycoon was a hypocrite.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421272/Trump-s-war-Megyn-tweets-picture-raunchy-photoshoot-accusing-hypocrisy.html"}
