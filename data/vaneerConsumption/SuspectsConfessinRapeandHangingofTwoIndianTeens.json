Indian television stations showed footage of the villagers sitting under the girls' bodies as they swung in the wind.\nPolice arrested two suspects on Wednesday and another on Saturday.\nWhen questioned by police, the men admitted they had attacked the girls, Saxena said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/suspects-confess-rape-hanging-two-indian-teens-n119661"}
