(AP) — The jailed leader of the armed takeover of an Oregon wildlife refuge faces a federal court hearing Friday along with several followers. Here's what we know about the case:\n— Ammon Bundy and 10 others are under arrest, charged with using force or intimidation to prevent government employees from carrying out their duties at the refuge. The group of ranchers and other activists seized the site a month ago in a protest against federal control of public lands in the West.\n— Bundy and some of the others are expected to plead for their release. But a federal judge said Thursday she will not set them free while the occupation continues.\n— The number of occupiers has dwindled from a couple of dozen to just four, and they want assurances they won't be arrested.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3423414/What-know-Oregon-wildlife-refuge-standoff.html"}
