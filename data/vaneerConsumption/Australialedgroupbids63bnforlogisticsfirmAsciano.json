The winners out of this are Asciano shareholders. They are either going to get a higher price or a good deal, whichever way the board recommends them to go with.\"\nBrookfield is still waiting for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's approval of its takeover bid. An earlier undertaking was rejected by the corporate watchdog owing to questions about competition issues.\nAsciano's board said it received and was considering Qube's proposal, but reiterated that it was continuing to unanimously recommend the Brookfield offer at this stage.\nAsciano shares closed 4.00 percent higher to Aus$8.84 Thursday in Sydney, while Qube ended the day's trade up 3.81 percent to Aus$2.18.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420482/Australia-led-group-bids-6-3bn-logistics-firm-Asciano.html"}
