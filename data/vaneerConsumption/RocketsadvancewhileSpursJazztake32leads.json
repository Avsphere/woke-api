Victor Oladipo threw a pass about 5 feet above Westbrook's head and out of bounds on the next possession and Harden made a layup on the other end with about 3 minutes left.\nHouston Rockets' James Harden (13) drives toward the basket as Oklahoma City Thunder's Andre Roberson, second from left, defends during the first half in Game 5 of an NBA basketball first-round playoff series, Tuesday, April 25, 2017, in Houston.

But Harden made two free throws both times they got close to secure the win.\n___\nSPURS 116, GRIZZLIES 103\nSAN ANTONIO (AP) - Kawhi Leonard had 28 points and San Antonio rebounded from two discouraging road losses to beat Memphis and take a 3-2 lead in their first-round series.\nSan Antonio shot 14 for 28 on 3-point attempts, two off its postseason record, including 5-for-7 shooting by Patty Mills.\nMills finished with 20 points and Tony Parker added 16.\nMike Conley had 26 points and Marc Gasol added 17 for the Grizzlies, who have lost nine straight postseason games in San Antonio.\nWith each team winning on its homecourt, Game 6 is Thursday night in Memphis.\n___\nJAZZ 96, CLIPPERS 92\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Gordon Hayward scored 27 points, Utah controlled the paint, and the Jazz beat the Los Angeles Clippers to take a 3-2 lead in their first-round series.\nHayward returned after missing most of Utah's win in Game 4 because of food poisoning.\nChris Paul's 3-pointer drew the Clippers within two with 5 seconds left. After George Hill hit two free throws, Paul struggled getting the ball under control near the sideline and couldn't do anything as time expired.\nThe Jazz made five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, including three by Rodney Hood, who finished with 16 points.\nPaul led the Clippers with 28 points and J.J. Redick added 26 with injured star Blake Griffin watching from the bench, his right foot encased in a black walking boot.\nThe Jazz can clinch the series with a victory in Game 6 on Friday night in Salt Lake City.\nHouston Rockets' James Harden (13) goes up for a shot as Oklahoma City Thunder's Andre Roberson defends during the first half in Game 5 of an NBA basketball first-round playoff series, Tuesday, April 25, 2017, in Houston.
