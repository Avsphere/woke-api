Type 2 makes up around 90 per cent of cases.\nTurning the heating down just 1°C eases diabetes as well as any medication, research shows\nWHAT IS TYPE 2 DIABETES? Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin or respond to the hormone. It is linked to being overweight or obese. Symptoms occur as the body tries to rid excess insulin in the blood. These include extreme thirst, weight loss, tiredness and urinating frequently. Medication may be required to normalise blood glucose levels. The condition can be prevented by eating well, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly. Source: NHS Choices\nScientists at Maastricht University, The Netherlands, exposed type 2 diabetes patients to cold temperatures at irregular intervals.\nAfter 10 days, their insulin sensitivity increased by more than 40 per cent.\nAccording to the researchers, these findings are comparable to the best diabetes medications available.\nThe researchers recommend homes and offices should incorporate 'drifting' temperatures.\nFluctuating building temperatures should be used alongside diet and exercise to help manage type 2 diabetes, they said.\nStudy author Professor Wouter van Marken Lichtenbel, said: 'It has previously been assumed that stable fixed indoor temperatures would satisfy comfort and health in most people.\n'However, this research indicates that mild cold and variable temperatures may have a positive effect on our health and at the same time are acceptable or even may create pleasure.'\nAccording to the paper, published in the journal Building Research & Information, the standard 'comfort zone' of buildings is 21-22°C.\nRichard Lorch, editor in chief of the journal, said: 'This groundbreaking research provides a new approach to how we think about heating and cooling our buildings.\n'The health benefits from a short exposure to a more varied temperature range will redefine our expectations on thermal comfort.\nAn estimated 4.5 million people are diagnosed with diabetes in the UK, 90% have type 2\n'In turn, this will change our practices for heating and cooling our buildings.'\nNot only could turning the temperature down benefit our health, but it may also have a significant impact on our planet.\nAccording to Mr Lorch, buildings account for up to 40 per cent of energy demand in developed countries and make up a 'significant proportion' of carbon dioxide emissions.\nReducing the heating of buildings may lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nThis comes after researchers from King's College London found obese children are four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\nThe rate of children developing the condition in Britain is more than five time higher than it was 20 years ago.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4446870/Turing-heating-eases-diabetes.html"}
