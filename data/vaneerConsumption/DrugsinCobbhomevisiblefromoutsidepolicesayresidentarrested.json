He’s in the Cobb County jail without bond.\nInvestigators said he had cocaine and marijuana in the house, and that the drugs were visible from outside. They have not said how Weathersby got the bruises on his face and a black eye.\nIn searching the house, officers also found scales and plastic bags and think Weathersby planned to distribute the drugs, according to Channel 2.\nNeighbors said they saw police cruisers at the house Sunday evening, so they knew something was up. But there was never a lot of foot traffic at the house in the year or so that the tenants were in the house..\n“Whatever he was doing,” said Kayla Delay, a resident in the neighborhood, “it wasn’t coming to him, he was going to it.”\nIn other news:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/drugs-cobb-home-visible-from-outside-police-say-resident-arrested/LFfwWTQ4yhPY2rjzLR44HN/"}
