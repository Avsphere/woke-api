The $599 headset will be delivered to the first customers in March, although the first wave sold out on the firm's website in seconds, and was quickly changed to show an April delivery date\nOCULUS RIFT SPECS The latest design of the Oculus Rift headset is described as 'really lightweight'. It has a built-in strap, and headphones to create a 3D audio effect. The firm has partnered with Microsoft for the gadget, and as a result it will use its Xbox One controller. As part of this partnership, the Rift will be able to stream Xbox One games to the Rift, Microsoft's Phil Spencer recently said. Oculus opened pre-orders for the VR headset on 6 January. The $599 headset will be delivered to the first customers in March, although the first wave sold out on the firm's website in seconds, and was quickly changed to show an April delivery date.\nTim Cook hinted at the project in the firm's latest financial results, telling reporterss and analysts 'It is really cool and has some interesting applications.'\nAccording to the FT, the secret research unit includes hundreds of staff from a series of small firms Apple has quietly acquired.\nIt also claims the firm haspoached staff from Microsoft and camera start-up Lytro, and recently bought Flyby Media, an augmented reality start-up that lets mobile devices 'see' the world around them.\nEarlier this year Apple hired one of the world's leading virtual reality researchers in a clear sign the firm is developing its own VR systems.\nIt comes just weeks after Oculus began preorders for its $599 rift.\nGoogle is also developing several VR systems, including cardboard, a $25 case for mobile phones.\nDoug Bowman joined Apple from Virginia Tech, where he had been director of its centre for human­computer interaction for around five years, the FT says.\nAccording to his academic profile, Mr Bowman focused his research on 'three­ dimensional user interface design and the benefits of immersion in virtual environments'.\nBen Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, told the FT it was 'unthinkable' that Apple has not been developing a VR system.\n'I'd wager that there is a substantial team within Apple figuring out how the company will play a role in this technology,' he said.\n'It certainly can't let rivals such as Facebook, Google and Samsung run away with the market, particularly given the groundswell of momentum building around smartphone ­based virtual reality.'\nDozens of firms are developing VR headsets.\nThe most highly anticipated is Facebook's Oculus Rift.\nHowever, its makers say the product is just the beginning - and say it will lead to a Star Trek 'holodeck' becoming a reality in 15 years.\n'Everyone wants the Holodeck, but we're not there tomorrow,' Max Cohen, the company's vice president of mobile, told Pocket Lint.\n'We'll get there incrementally.\n'We'll basically attack different sets of problems and we'll try to make the experience as good as possible.'\nIn recent months, price estimates for Facebook's Oculus Rift ranged from the relatively cheap $350 right up to $1,500, so when the official price tag was announced last week, it divided opinion.\nMany were relieved that, at $600, the headset is more than half the most expensive prediction, while others accused the firm for targeting only the high-end of the market.\nOculus' chief executive Brendan Iribe (pictured) has defended the headset's price and revealed the company has a 'razor-thin' margin to make the device as affordable as possible\nNow Oculus' chief executive has defended the headset's price and revealed the company has a 'razor-thin' margin to make the device as affordable as possible.\nOculus opened pre-orders for the VR headset on 6 January.\nThe $599 headset will be delivered to the first customers in March, although the first wave sold out on the firm's website in seconds, and was quickly changed to show an April delivery date.\nIt will also require most users to buy a new high-end gaming PC, and experts claim only 1 per cent of machines currently on the market are powerful enough to 'drive' the headset.\nThe Rift will additionally be available in limited locations at select retailers starting in April.\nIn an interview, HTC's boss Cher Wang said pre-orders for its full-body virtual reality Vive system will open on 29 February with the device going on general sale in April. However, prices are yet to be announced\nWHAT IS HTC VIVE? Vive moves beyond just a headset and uses Kinect-style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in their games. Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles. The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better. HTC's Vive has 'full room scale' and two wireless controllers with hand tracking. At this year's CES, the company showed off the latest, advanced version of the technology. It has built on the original model unveiled ten months ago and has made the latest model more comfortable with a redesigned strap to give it more stability and balance. On the inside, interchangeable foam inserts and nose gaskets mean the Vive Pre fits more comfortably and securely to the user. It has an updated front-facing camera and a new dual stage trigger that makes interacting with objects smoother, while haptic feedback makes these interactions feel more lifelike.\nBundles that include an Oculus Ready PC and a Rift will be available for pre-order in February starting at $1,499.\nSpeaking to The Washington Post at the Consumer Electronics Show, Oculus boss Brendan Iribe explained: 'We made it as close to the cost of the hardware as possible. The margin is razor-thin.'\nHe added that, in the first instance, Oculus is looking to break even with sales of the highly-anticipated gadget.\nIt follows on from reports that Samsung's PlayStation VR rival will cost in the region of $800.\nA listing, which appeared to have been posted by accident on Amazon's Canada site, revealed the PlayStation VR will cost $1,125 CAD, which converts to $800 USD or £770.\nThe page was spotted by Forbes, and the price has since been removed.\nSony said in a statement: 'This was an error by Amazon, we haven't announced a price for PlayStation VR.'\nHowever, it is not clear if this means that the posting of the listing was an error, or the price shown on the listing was the mistake the statement refers to.\nElsewhere, the long-term health effects of virtual reality have recently come into question.\nDonning the headset can cause nausea, eyestrain and headaches, for example.\nHeadset makers don't recommend their devices for children, and Samsung and Oculus urge adults to take at least 10-minute breaks every half-hour, and they warn against driving, riding a bike or operating machinery if the user feels odd after a session.\nStanford University professor Jeremy Bailenson told the Wall Street Journal his 15 years of research consistently have shown virtual reality can change how a user thinks and behaves, in part because it is so realistic.\n'We shouldn't fathom this as a media experience; we should fathom it as an experience,' said Professor Bailenson, who also co-founded Strivr Labs, which helps football players relive practice in virtual reality.\nThe latest design of the Oculus Rift headset is described as 'really lightweight'. It has a built-in strap, and headphones to create a 3D audio effect.\nThe firm has partnered with Microsoft for the gadget, and as a result it will use its Xbox One controller.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3423326/Apple-team-hundreds-developing-virtual-augmented-reality-system.html"}
