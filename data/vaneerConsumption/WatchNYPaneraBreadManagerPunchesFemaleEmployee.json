The employee reentered the restaurant, which prompted the filming of the incident, and then the scuffle happened.\nA loud clap can be heard right before the manager hits the employee, eventually dropping her roughly to the ground.\nBoth the manager and the employee have been fired, but no criminal charges are known to have been filed at this time.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/07/09/watch-ny-panera-bread-punches-female-employee/"}
