The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nIn Hailey, Idaho, the hometown of freed U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl, the joy at his release has turned for some into shock and fear — the fear of picking up the phone.\nThat's because some town officials have been deluged with angry calls from people who think that Bergdahl is an Army deserter or traitor who doesn't deserve a hero's welcome.\nJane Drussel, the president of the Hailey Chamber of Commerce, has been fielding dozens of angry calls.\n\"Well, (I feel) disappointment number one, just absolutely total surprise at how bad some of them are,\" she told NBC News on Tuesday.\nWhen the news that Bergdahl had been freed from five years of captivity in Afghanistan in exchange for five Taliban commanders broke on Saturday, most reactions were happy, but the nebulous details of how he wound up in enemy hands in 2009 has caused some — both civilians and military — to turn against him and his family.\n\"Saturday and Sunday were days of rejoicement, we were all so happy that at last after five years, that Bowe had been released,\" said Drussel. \"Happy for him and happy for his parents who we lived with day in and day out and saw the hurt and the weariness from the venture of trying to get their son released.\"\n\"All these five years, never a word of any negative nature whatsoever. And now, after two days, I was shocked when late at night, watching (TV) I started seeing the dragon's head roar. Comments that are just off the wall.\"\n\"You know, we’re Americans, and we need to act like Americans, and to me that’s un-American.\"\nDrussel said many of the calls are cancelling trips to the town of about 8,000.\n\"Well, number one is, how dare we as a community support someone who in their mind they’re thinking of as a 'deserter,' a traitor. That they had plans to come here on their vacation, they’re no longer coming, they’re cancelling their reservations.\"\n\"I just find that shocking,\" she said. \"You know, we’re Americans, and we need to act like Americans, and to me that’s un-American. Let things play out, and if there needs to be action taken, I’m sure it will be taken. But that’s not the city of Hailey’s responsibility.\"\nShe said the staffers at the Chamber of Commerce, and at a store she runs, don't know how to deal with the vitriol.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bowe-bergdahl-released/officials-bergdahls-hometown-stop-hate-n121761"}
