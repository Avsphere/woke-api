Panera Bread and Maison Keyser have also recently closed Manhattan locations, CO reported. And nationally, Starbucks and Chipotle announced they would have to close 150 and 65 stores, respectively.\nSome industry professionals think too many chains thought they could successfully compete in the Manhattan market. \"With all the amazing pastries, soups and sandwiches available in New York City, why on earth would anyone go to a Panera?\" said Newmark Knight Frank retail broker Jeffrey Roseman.\nRetail rents rose 50 percent in Manhattan between 2010 and 2017, according to a report from real estate firm CBRE.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-rents-causing-fast-food-chains-to-close-stores-2018-7"}
