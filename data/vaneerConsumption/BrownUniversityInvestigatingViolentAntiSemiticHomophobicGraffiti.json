The event was cancelled when pro-Palestinian groups published an online petition accusing its co-sponsor, Hillel, of defending “Israeli state policies of occupation and racial apartheid.”\nIn an email sent Friday to the entire Brown student body, University President Christina Paxson expressed horror at the graffiti incident and promised that campus police would undertake a thorough investigation.\n“I’m disturbed, disgusted, and disappointed that Brown community members would do this, but am, sadly, not surprised,” she wrote.\n“While the graffiti has been removed, the impact of identity-based bias and threat is not easily wiped away. … This incident impacts not only those immediately involved, but threatens our shared sense of safety and respect on campus,” the email noted.\nThe email emphasized that Brown “is committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive, engaged campus and a safe and secure environment for every member of the campus community. Incidents that threaten the participation and belonging of members of our community are personally difficult and communally unacceptable.”\nHowever, JewishPress.com reported that the the university’s Crime Alerts page carried no mention of the vandalism on its list of incidents. The most recent incident to make the list was dated December 2015.\n“Anti-Semitic and anti-Israel sentiment has been allowed to fester on our campus for years now. I’m disturbed, disgusted and disappointed that Brown community members would do this, but am, sadly, not surprised,” BU student Laura Galvan told Campus Reform.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/03/20/brown-university-investigating-violent-anti-semitic-homophobic-graffiti/"}
