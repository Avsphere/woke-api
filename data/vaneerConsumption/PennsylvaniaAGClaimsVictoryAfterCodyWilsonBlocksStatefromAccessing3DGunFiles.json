The files are to be available en mass on August 1, 2018.\nIn an effort to counter 3-D file-sharing Shapiro says that he, “Gov. Tom Wolf (D) and the Pennsylvania State Police sued [Wilson’s company] before its formal rollout of a downloadable gun program.” Shapiro sought a Temporary Restraining Order which the judge rejected. Wilson volunteered to block file sharing in Pennsylvania in the short term.\nShapiro described 3-D printed guns in ominous tones: “The harm to Pennsylvanians would have been immediate and irreversible. Defense Distributed was promising to distribute guns in Pennsylvania in reckless disregard of the state laws that apply to gun sales and purchases in our Commonwealth. Once these untraceable guns are on our streets and in our schools, we can never get them back.”\nIt should be pointed out that plans for 3-D printed guns are readily available and have been for some time, both around the country and around the world. Plans for 3-D gun parts are available as well. Wilson’s victory rests in the ability to share his files for 3-D guns and gun parts online.\nWilson spoke to Breitbart News about Shapiro’s claims, saying, “Shapiro tried to lie to a federal judge and take down my site nationwide. I am temporarily blocking access to PA as a concession to our judge and a show of good faith.”\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
