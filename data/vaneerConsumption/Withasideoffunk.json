The man who has been at the helm of the small, historically black college for roughly a decade steps down this summer to assume fundraising as head of the college's foundation where he will try to orchestrate more praiseworthy live auction items such as the dinner party at Beth and Mike Coulson's served up by chef Donnie Ferneau that went for $3,000. Barry Griffith nabbed it.\nFootball Hall of Famer Keith Jackson led the live auction like a champ. Host \"Broadway\" Joe Booker opened the night and handed the mic to comedian Keith Glason for a short stand-up act.\nAfter a live auction, dinner was served -- a pretty heaping portion of braised short ribs prepared by Arkansas Baptist College Bistro, smoked provolone grits and vegetables, with a berry shortcake and chocolate torte for dessert -- and Booker introduced Hill, who acknowledged Beth Coulson, the school's board president, and board members Kenneth Harris and Richard Mays.\nThe Bar-Kays and Lakeside continue the tradition of a strong musical act headlining this fundraiser. In 2010, Al Green came home to kick off the first Supper & Soul and help the college raise about $300,000. (Coulson was involved in that one, too.)\nThe next year, it was Gladys Knight, then the Commodores. In 2014, the '80s R&B group S.O.S. Band, like the performers who went before them, took older guests back to their youth and introduced young people to some \"real-school\" music.\nThe night raised about $280,000, Linda Gillam said.\nHigh Profile on 05/01/2016","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/may/01/with-a-side-of-funk-20160501/"}
