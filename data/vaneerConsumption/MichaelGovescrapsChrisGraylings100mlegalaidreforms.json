Above, actress Maxine Peake is pictured joining barristers and solicitors as they demonstrated against the reforms in March 2014\nThe reforms, which had already been delayed for several months after Mr Gove replaced Mr Grayling as Justice Secretary last May, provoked anger from law firms who faced losing out.\nThe changes would have cut the number of contracts given to law firms from 1,600 to around 500 and reduced rates of work.\nThey were designed to save money for taxpayers and slash the £1.5billion legal aid bill, one of the most expensive systems in the world.\nBut Mr Gove said there were 'real problems' in pressing ahead with the proposals in the face of a series of legal challenges.\n'My department currently faces 99 separate legal challenges over the procurement process, which has required us, anyway, to stay the award of new contracts at least until April,' he said in a statement.\nMICHAEL GOVE'S JUSTICE POLICY U-TURNS Michael Gove has made a series of significant changes to Justice policy since replacing Chris Grayling after May's general election Cancelled a £5.9million contract to supply training programmes for prisons in Saudi Arabia.\nDitched plans to build 'secure colleges' for young offenders\nEnded the ban on books being sent into prisons\nShelved planned cuts to barristers' fees for legal aid cases\nAbandoned plans to outsource the collection of fines by courts, at a cost of nearly £9 million\nEnded the controversial criminal courts charge\n'My decision is driven in part by the recognition that the litigation will be time-consuming and costly for all parties, whatever the outcome,' he said.\n'I do not want my department and the legal aid market to face months if not years of continuing uncertainty, and expensive litigation, while it is heard.'\nLabour hit out at the 'fiasco' and demanded ministers admit how much public money had been 'wasted' on the reforms.\nLord Falconer, the Shadow Justice Secretary, said: 'This is a staggering admission from the Tory Government and represents a final confirmation that their plans to reform criminal legal aid have descended into utter chaos.\n'Labour, practitioners and experts warned from the start that this flawed policy would be a disaster but Ministers pushed ahead regardless.'\n'While it's welcome that they have finally listened, the Government must now come clean about how much public money has been wasted on this doomed endeavour, so that ministers can be held fully accountable for this fiasco.'\nToday's announcement adds to a growing list of policies Mr Gove has ditched since he became Justice Secretary last summer.\nHe abandoned Mr Grayling's plans for a new secure college for young offenders, ended the ban on books being sent into prisons designed to stop contraband getting into jails, and ditched the court charge on convicted criminals.\nHe also cancelled a £5.9million contract to supply training programmes for prisons in Saudi Arabia.\nThe proposed changes to legal aid sparked the first ever walk-out by barristers in the UK in January 2014.\nCriminal barristers went on strike again last July over the further changes that were scrapped by Mr Gove today.\nToday's decision was warmly welcomed by the Criminal Bar Association.\nThe group's chairman, Mark Fenhalls QC, said: 'The CBA applauds the Lord Chancellor's decision to abandon the Ministry of Justice's flawed plans to reform the duty contracts for legal aid solicitors.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421240/Michael-Gove-scraps-Chris-Grayling-s-100m-legal-aid-reforms.html"}
