The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe student hero who police say subdued a gunman and prevented a wider killing spree at a Seattle college this week hasn’t spoken publicly about his actions that day — but the Internet sure has, and it’s putting its money where its mouth is.\nAs of Saturday, an online fundraiser had raised more than $23,000 for Jon Meis, who is apparently engaged and has an open wedding registry. The registry was found by members of the popular Internet site Reddit and quickly made the rounds online.\nMeis, a student building monitor, pepper-sprayed alleged gunman Aaron Ybarra during Thursday's shooting spree on the campus of Seattle Pacific University. A 19-year-old student was shot dead and three others wounded.\nAfter Meis pepper-sprayed Ybarra, other students jumped on the gunman and disarmed him, police said.\n\"But for the terrific response of the people at Seattle Pacific University, this incident might have been much more tragic,\" Seattle Assistant Police Chief Paul McDonagh said after the rampage.\nYbarra, 26, is being held without bail pending his arraignment on a count of premeditated murder and a count of assault.\nPolice say he confessed to carrying out the shooting spree, and that his goal was to kill as many people as he could before committing suicide. His public defender said Friday that Ybarra has a long history of mental illness and was “delusional” when the crime occurred.\nA voice message at a phone listing for Meis’ parents' house asks for privacy and prayers for the family of the man killed.\n— Phil Helsel\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wedding-gifts-pour-seattle-shooting-hero-jon-meis-n125441"}
