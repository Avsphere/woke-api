They do not agree with and do not consent to Hillary Clinton’s attempted rewriting of history and the attempted hiding of what is arguably her criminal negligence in what she calls the “fog of war.” Family members of the Benghazi dead talked to Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly Wednesday night after viewing the world premier of 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. Charles Woods and Jeremiah Woods, father and brother of Ty Woods, and Patricia Smith. mother of Sean, repeated their consistent statements that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and U.N. ambassador Susan Rice all told them in front of their son’s caskets that Benghazi was the fault of a video and they would get, not the terrorist’s that killed their sons, but the filmmaker.

at the funerals of the victims which collaborate [sic] that Hillary Clinton told the families the known lie that the YouTube video was responsible, was a crying Pat Smith, who sadly declared the one thing she would like to say. The poor lady couldn’t even make it through the whole movie, having to leave immediately upon seeing the actor portraying her son. Almost like Bill Clinton’s multiple victims of his sexual assault victims who were labeled as liars, Hillary Clinton claimed to not have told the families that the YouTube video was responsible -- in essence calling the families liars.\n“Liar,” interestingly enough, was the top word most associated with Hillary Clinton in an August 2015 Quinnipiac University poll. So who is lying about Benghazi? Perhaps the best answer is to ask who gains the most by lying. Not the parents, who only want to know how and why their sons had to die. Hillary Clinton has every reason to lie. The truth, as told by the three men who survived the firefight at the Benghazi mission and atop the CIA annex waiting for a rescue Hillary helped stop, would doom her candidacy. Shamelessly, Hillary Clinton is calling the families liars, as the Daily Mail reports\nThe Daily Sun, a newspaper in rural Conway, New Hampshire, hosted an editorial board meeting with Clinton on Wednesday. Columnist Tom McLaughlin recounted for her the claims of victims' family members who said she had told them a crude Internet video that mocked the Islamic faith was responsible for inciting the attackers who killed their loved ones. Clinton has denied making any such statement, despite the accounts of four people. One, the father of a slain CIA security contractor, took written notes of her words. 'Somebody is lying,' McLaughlin told her Wednesday. 'Who is it?' 'Not me, that's all I can tell you,' Clinton replied, casting blame on the families.\nIt would be hard to believe that all the members of the families who were there all have the same faulty recollection of Hillary’s words. Kathleen Quigley, the sister of Glen Doherty, another fallen hero of Benghazi, in addition to Charles Woods and Patricia Smith, has also said that Hillary lied to the families:\n'She knows that she knew what happened that day and she wasn't truthful,' Kate Quigley told the Boston Herald Radio's Morning Meeting on Wednesday. 'This is a woman that will do and say anything to get what she wants. I have very little respect for her. 'I know what she said to me and she can say all day long that she didn't say it. That's her cross to bear.' She adds: 'As someone who has suffered so much heartache over the loss of Glen, it is hard to consider the possibility that help could have come much sooner.\nInvestor’s Business Daily reported the gripping 2013 testimony of Patricia Smith before Rep. Darrell Issa’s House Oversight Committee:\nPhony scandals don't produce body bags. Mrs. Smith testified how President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary Clinton, among other top administration officials, approached her at the casket ceremony when her son's body was returned to the U.S. \"Every one of them came up to me, gave me a big hug, and I asked them, 'What happened, please tell me?' And every one of them said it was the video. And we all know that it wasn't the video. Even at that time they knew it wasn't the video. So they all lied to me.\"\nAs IBD also noted, Charles Woods recollection of Hillary’s statements was quite clear: Clinton expressed no regrets for repeating the video lie to Woods in front of his son's casket as it arrived at Dover Air Force Base:\n\"Her countenance was not good, and she made this statement to me... she said we will make sure that the person who made that film is arrested and prosecuted,\" he told radio host Glenn Beck, adding that he \"could tell that she was not telling me the truth.\"\nThe movie 13 Hours is based on the book in which three CIA contractors Kris Paronto, John Tiegen, and Mark Geist, tells the tale of the battle they fought alongside Glen Doherty and Sean Smith in the terrorist attack which claimed the life of Ambassador Chris Stevens.\nIt confirms that Benghazi was not a spontaneous demonstration gone bad due a video, despite Susan Rice repeating that lie on five Sunday talk shows, and President Obama repeating it six times before the United Nations. Hillary Clinton knew it was a lie, telling the truth to daughter Chelsea and an Egyptian diplomat before she lied to the parents of the Benghazi dead. It confirms that rescuers were told to stand down.\n13 Hours should be the life expectancy of Hillary’s candidacy after the film’s release. It confirms that Hillary Clinton is a liar who should never again see the inside of the White House unless she has a ticket for the next tour.\nDaniel John Sobieski is a freelance writer whose pieces have appeared in Investor’s Business Daily, Human Events, Reason Magazine and the Chicago Sun-Times among other publications.","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/01/em13_hoursem_and_counting_to_the_end_of_hillarys_candidacy.html"}
