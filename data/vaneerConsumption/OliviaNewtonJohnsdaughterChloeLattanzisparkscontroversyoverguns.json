Safety on. Beautiful rifles.'\nAdding that no one in her family used the weapons to hunt, she continued: 'If you eat meat don't come on here talking about guns are killing machines.\n'We don't eat meat so us shooting guns at targets (is) far less harmful than people supporting the slaughter and cruelty to animals (sic)'.\nFamily: Chloe (seen above with her mother Olivia Newton-John) made the comments while visiting her father in Oregon\nSome followers pointed out the controversy in her post, with one arguing: 'Just like any other gun they can be used properly for sport or improperly for killing. No more lethal than a revolver or any other firearm.'\nAn adamant Chloe responded by telling how her 'dad and fianc√© love guns' before asking: 'If you don't kill with guns, why are they a problem? I don't get it.'\nHowever on Monday, the blonde returned to social media to tell followers she had been 'too scared' to go shooting herself at a range.\n'Too scared': Later the 29-year-old admitted she had been 'too scared' to go shooting herself at a range\nScrutiny: The singer later uploaded a photograph of a child at the same range with a rifle, with one user commenting beneath it to express their discomfort\nPosting an image of herself in a green parka coat, she wrote: 'I couldn't shoot. 2 scary. I'd rather go to a petting zoo and cuddle fuzzy baby animals (sic).'\nShe later shared another image of a young boy standing next to a rifle which prompted further scrutiny.\n'Doesn't look right,' said one follower beneath the photograph of the child.\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted a representative for Chloe and Olivia Newton-John in relation to this article.\nParents: Chloe is Olivia's only child with her second husband Matt. The trio are seen above in 1991 when she was five\nSpeaking out: Chloe pleaded with followers that if no one was injured through the use of guns she could not see 'the problem'\nHer comments come as the debate surrounding gun control in the U.S. rages on, with President Obama last week shedding tears as he discussed the issue.\nUrging reform on the issue, he wept: 'All of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies.'\nThe President had been paying tribute to the victims of gun massacres across the U.S. when he made the emotional plea.\nChloe is Olivia Newton-John's only child with her first husband Matt.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3393280/Beautiful-assault-rifles-Olivia-Newton-John-s-daughter-Chloe-Lattanzi-sparks-controversy-posting-photograph-father-posing-guns-bed.html"}
