The spoof Clinton then kneels down, destroying the server with the bat and punching it to bits — a reference to Clinton’s personal email server scandal.\nMorning Joe tweeted an MSNBC clip with the ad early Friday morning:\nFirst look at new @tedcruz ad in SC targeting @HillaryClinton and lampooning classic 'Office Space' scene https://t.co/Mu1YI4KJZJ — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) February 12, 2016\nOne portion of the video says:\nGot a crew for the fight on the airwaves. Lap dogs in the press, keep their mouths tight. ’Cause a Clinton never needs to explain what, why it is, what they’ve done, or with who. A real Clinton knows that they’re entitled, and you don’t get to know what they do.\nDuring Thursday night’s PBS and Facebook-sponsored Democratic presidential debate with Clinton and fellow-candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, the moderators never asked Clinton about State Department subpoenas issued for internal Clinton Foundation documents. In an article for Breitbart News, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer called the negligence no less than “monumental journalistic malpractice.”\n“What, what, what difference does it make?” riffs a clip from Clinton’s infamous Benghazi testimony. It continues in another voice: “For a Clinton, what’s loaded in some fat Apple file. A Clinton plays the victim for promotion. A Clinton kills it off with a smile.”\n“D**n it feels good to be a Clinton. A server full of secrets ain’t no thang” is heard before an MSNBC reporter cuts off the end of the ad, calling it “a little cheeky” that Cruz is throwing a pop culture reference in. The final images show the Clinton impersonator being pulled away from the server by the other two people with her. Then Clinton tears herself away to go back at it, similar to the original Office Space movie scene.\nFor comparison, here’s a clip of the original Office Space printer scene, courtesy of YouTube user MrJigssaw1989:\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/02/12/cruz-office-space-ad-hits-hillary/"}
