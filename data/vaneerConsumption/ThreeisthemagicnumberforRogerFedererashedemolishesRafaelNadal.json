I can tell you that,” Federer said in his post-match press conference.\n“But most importantly, I won Australia. That was big for me. On the comeback, I look back at that and think that was one of the coolest things I ever experienced in my career.\nDesert night, under light, great fight pic.twitter.com/JaJ5aY1YO4 — Roger Federer (@rogerfederer) March 15, 2017\n“All the matches that we have played are unique in many ways for both of us, winning or losing. So I take it.\n“For me, it was all about coming out and trying to play the way I did in Australia. I didn’t think it was going to be that possible, to be quite honest, because the court is more jumpy here so it’s hard to put the ball away.\n“So getting in the lead was crucial, and then staying on the offence and pressing was the goal for me. It was a really good performance by me, I thought.”\n\"It was a physically good match,\" Federer says. \"I can't celebrate this too long. I've got to get back to work in a couple days\" #BNPPO17 pic.twitter.com/sgbIWBFivh — BNP Paribas Open (@BNPPARIBASOPEN) March 16, 2017\nIn a match where conditions were supposed to favour Nadal’s wicked top spin forehand, Federer hit his opponent off the court.\nThe tone was set in the opening game where Federer sent down two scorching backhand winners to take Nadal’s serve and a second break soon after wrapped up the set in just 36 minutes.\nTwo more breaks followed in the second set, the second of which sealed the win, with match point being converted with another sizzling backhand winner.\nRafael Nadal admitted the best player won during his latest duel with Roger Federer (Mark J. Terrill/AP)\nFederer’s reward for the victory is a last-eight meeting with Australian Nick Krygios, who earlier stunned Novak Djokovic with a superb straight sets win.\nNadal was off his game and knew Federer was the better player.\nHe said: “He returned well. But at the same time, it was obvious that I didn’t have the right answer for his returns. I needed to neutralise the points. I needed to neutralise his two first balls, and I didn’t.\n“So I was not enough good tonight and he deserved the victory, for sure. Very easy.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4319270/Three-magic-number-Roger-Federer-demolishes-Rafael-Nadal.html"}
