The area has been secured by Israeli forces in recent months because of attacks by Palestinians from the area.\nThe Palestinian health ministry gave the assailant’s age as 16.\nHis death raised to seven the number of alleged attackers – six Palestinians and a Jordanian – killed by the army since Friday, in incidents in which Israeli authorities said at least nine Israelis have been wounded.\nThe surge in violence coincides with preparations for the Jewish new year holiday starting on Oct. 2 and as the anniversary of the wave of attacks that began last October nears.\nIn the past year, at least 218 Palestinians have died in violent incidents in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Of those, 147 were identified by authorities as assailants while others were killed during clashes and protests.\nPalestinians, many acting alone and with rudimentary weapons, have killed at least 33 Israelis and two visiting Americans in the attacks.\nIsrael says anti-Israeli incitement by Palestinian officials and on social media networks is stoking attacks.\nHamas, the Islamist group that rules the Gaza Strip, declined to comment on the drone the Israeli army said had been intercepted off the coast of the enclave.\nIt was the first such incident reported since the 2014 Gaza war, when a U.S.-supplied Israeli Patriot missile destroyed an unmanned Hamas aircraft over the southern Israeli port city of Ashdod.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/09/20/israel-shoots-hamas-terror-drone-west-bank-violence-surges/"}
