And those guys kicked in that door and shot them at point-blank range.”\nAlexander declined to discuss that case further, saying it was still under investigation.\nBut he said police are still searching for Cutrez Johnson, 16, also known as “Lil Red,” and Oslushla Smith, 19, also known as Budda or Boo, in connection with the May 3 shooting of Michael Phillips, 29, at a party in south DeKalb.\nAnother man, Kemontay Cullins, 18, was arrested Sunday in connection with the May 3 killing.\nPolice said Johnson and Smith either lived in the home involved in the Saturday night shooting or “had connections” where the baby lived on To Lani Farm Road.\nThe neighborhood is off Redan Road in south DeKalb. Police said three or four men with their faces covered with bandannas kicked in the back door of the home on To Lani Farm Road sometime after 10:30 p.m. Saturday.\nThree terrified women inside grabbed the baby, ran upstairs and tried to lock themselves into a bathroom, but the gunmen kicked it in and fired at them multiple times. Their names were not released. The women are 36, 23, and 21, police said. The 21-year-old is thought to be the baby’s mother.\nAlexander said the home invasion came about five hours after authorities got an anonymous call saying that a woman’s body could be found on Agape Way in DeKalb. That body turned out to be Alexis Malone, 19, who police said witnessed the May 3 killing.\nPolice said on May 3 they were called to The Mountain Lake apartment complex on North Hairson road, where Phillips had been shot to death in the head.\nA 25-year-old Mountain Lake resident told the AJC he ran out of his apartment nearby when he heard gunshots May 3. He said numerous people were in a garden apartment watching the Floyd Mayweather championship fight, drinking and socializing, spilling outside into a grassy area at the corner of the building. The man, whose name the newspaper is withholding for fear of reprisal against him, said some young uninvited guests arrived, leading to a fight, which then got worse because, he said, “everybody had guns.”\nHe said the gunmen had come at Phillips from two sides and he raised his hands in surrender. That’s when he was shot, Smith said, adding that he is told the shooters were members of the Bloods street gang.\nPolice will not say if they believe the shootings are gang related.\nDeKalb County police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said the crime spree is not related to a drive-by shooting Saturday evening that left two men dead and three other people wounded. That case happened around 7 p.m. on Shamrock Drive, south of Decatur, where a car followed another car and then occupants of the trail vehicle opened fire.\nOne man and two women were also wounded in that attack. No names have been released in that case.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/warrant-issued-for-woman-connection-with-dekalb-witness-killing/Sc93BlhMq4LnyhNvOq0cdJ/"}
