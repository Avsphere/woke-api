Rand Paul filibustered the bill right before the Congressional Memorial Day recess. On Saturday, a vote for the Patriot Act extensions failed by a 45-54 vote. Eight Republican Senators voted against the legislation, while 45 Democrats and one Independent voted against the extensions.\nMcConnell is expected to call senators back from recess on Sunday to attempt to extend the program before it expires next Monday.\n“This needs to get done,” Obama said, highlighting the importance of the Patriot Act extensions calling them “necessary to keep American people safe and secure.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/05/26/obama-demands-mitch-mcconnell-work-through-recess-to-extend-patriot-act-provisions/"}
