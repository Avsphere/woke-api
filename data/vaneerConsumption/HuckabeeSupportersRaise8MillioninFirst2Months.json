Mike Huckabee (R-AR) has raised roughly eight million dollars since launching his campaign about two months ago, on May 5.\nA senior campaign advisor told Breitbart News the $8 million comes from the presidential campaign committee and affiliated committees.\nAccording to the advisor, it’s more than three times as much as Huckabee raised in the first three quarters combined during his 2008 campaign. Huckabee was outspent 10 to one in 2008 but still managed to win the Iowa caucuses and seven other states.\nTwo million dollars – from the campaign committee – includes only primary election money.\nAffiliated committees raised close to six million dollars, so the total reaches just about eight million dollars raised thus far by Huckabee supporters from all 50 states, with the average contribution being $101 dollars.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/14/huckabee-supporters-raise-8-million-in-first-2-months-of-campaign/"}
