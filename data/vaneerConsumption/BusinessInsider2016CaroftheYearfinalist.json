The Transportation team at Business Insider is gearing up to choose our 2016 Car of the Year.\nThis will be the third year for the award. In 2014, the Corvette Stingray was the big winner. In 2015, the Volvo XC90 took home the prize.\nEach year, we've expanded the competition. This 2016 contest will be the biggest yet, as 15 finalists face off. These are the vehicles, from sedans to supercars, that impressed us most. They're the best of the best and were selected after a year of test-driving and reviewing dozens of cars, trucks, SUVs, crossovers, and sports cars.\nWe'll announce the 2016 Car of the Year in December. As a bonus this year, we're adding two more awards: Infotainment System of the Year; and Audio System of the Year.\nSo here they are, the 15 finalists for Business Insider's 2016 Car of the Year:\nPhotos by Hollis Johnson.\nGraphic by Skye Gould.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-2016-car-of-the-year-nominee-2016-12"}
