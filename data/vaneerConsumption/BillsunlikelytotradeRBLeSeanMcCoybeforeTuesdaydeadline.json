As of Sunday morning, that appears unlikely.\nBuffalo has spoken to at least three teams, but none has been willing to offer what it would take to get a deal done for McCoy, according to sources.\nMcCoy, 30, suffered a concussion in last week's loss to the Indianapolis Colts but is expected to play Monday night against the New England Patriots, a source told ESPN.\nA six-time Pro Bowler, McCoy has rushed for 244 yards in six games this season, his fourth with the Bills.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/bills-trade-rb-lesean-mccoy-tuesday-deadline/story?id=58805664"}
