The figure topped 20,000 before the end of the month.\nBorrell, a member of the Socialist Party said: “We’re talking about 20,000 (migrants) so far this year for a country of more than 40 million inhabitants. That’s not mass migration.”\n“Europe’s demographic evolution shows that unless we want to gradually turn into an ageing continent, we need new blood, and it doesn’t look like this new blood is coming from our capacity to procreate,” he added.\nWhile the Spanish police believe that at least 50,000 migrants are currently waiting to cross into the country, others have warned that the number could reach millions if the government does not change course.\n800 Migrants Storm Fences to Enter Spanish Enclave in Africa https://t.co/DA6VLjF4nB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 26, 2018\nThe leader of the Popular Party Pablo Casado warned: “It isn’t possible to give legal papers to everyone, nor is it for Spain to absorb the millions of Africans who come looking for a better future in Europe.”\n“And because it’s not possible, we have to say so, even if it is politically incorrect,” he added.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/08/01/spain-expects-50000-migrants-north-africa-minister-europe-needs-new-blood/"}
