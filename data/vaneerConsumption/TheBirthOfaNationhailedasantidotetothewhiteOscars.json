Turner escaped, but far more slaves were killed than whites\nCaptured: A woodcut purported to show how the rebel was found, months after the others who had taken part had been executed. His lawyer would go on to publish the 'Confessions' purporting to give Turner's version. Turner was literate, unlike many slaves, and said to be highly intelligent. Historians are unsure how much credence to give it. One expert says the 'consensus' is that it is broadly his voice\nBig noise: The Birth of a Nation was shown for the first time at the Sundance festival this month and achieved the biggest ever deal signed at it. It stars Nate Parker as Nat Turner\nAfter the rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia in August 1831 was finally suppressed some 60 blacks accused of being co-conspirators were executed.\nTurner was hanged after avoiding capture for two months and white militias killed around 200 blacks in revenge attacks even though they had nothing to do with the rebellion.\nThe Confessions is controversial among historians and some have argued that it could have been written by Thomas Gray, Turner's lawyer, who wanted to cash in on the public interest in the case.\nBut it cuts to the heart of the debate about Turner and shows how he is a morally ambiguous character whose legacy is still being debated today.\nHis slave rebellion is the subject of the film Birth of a Nation for which Fox Searchlight has paid $17.5 million for the global rights, the biggest deal in Sundance history.\nThe film has been lauded by critics and the deal comes at a time when Hollywood is under intense pressure over its lack of minorities in the Academy.\n'The murder of this family, five in number, was the work of a moment, not one of them awoke; there was a little infant sleeping in a cradle, that was forgotten, until we had left the house and gone some distance, when Henry and Will returned and killed it\nDirector Spike Lee and actor Will Smith are boycotting this year's Oscars and the Academy has promised major changes to become more diverse.\nNumerous other actors including Michael Caine, Charlotte Rampling, William H. Macy and David Oyelowo have spoken out during what appears to be a moment of change for the film industry.\nBirth of a Nation is directed by and stars African American actor and producer Nate Parker, best known for appearing in the Liam Neeson thriller Non Stop.\nIt tells the story of Turner's life, starting with how he was born in October 2, 1800 on a plantation in Southampton County.\nUnlike many slaves he had learned how to read and write after one of his masters allowed him to be educated.\nTurner became known as 'Prophet Nat' and was revered by other slaves and served as their pastor because of his deep Christian faith which he said gave him visions from God.\nIn February 1831, Turner thought that his visions were telling him to rebel against his master and after seeing an eclipse he carried it out on August 21, 1831.\nThe Confessions is unflinching in its portrait of the terror that the rebellion brought to the citizens of Southampton County.\nIt says that their first target was Turner's master's house which they got into by climbing up a ladder and going through a window, where they stole his guns.\nThe Confessions says that at that point Turner realized that 'I must spill the first blood'.\nThe Confessions says: 'Armed with a hatchet, and accompanied by (co-conspirator) Will, I entered my master's chamber, it being dark, I could not give a death blow, the hatchet glanced from his head, he sprang from the bed and called his wife, it was his last word.\n'Will laid him dead, with a blow of his axe, and Mrs. Travis shared the same fate, as she lay in bed.\n'The murder of this family, five in number, was the work of a moment, not one of them awoke; there was a little infant sleeping in a cradle, that was forgotten, until we had left the house and gone some distance, when Henry and Will returned and killed it'.\nAs it was published: The Confessions was a hit with the public and had to be reprinted because of demand for its gory details. Nat Turner's lawyer published it, claiming it was his full testimony\nScene of the rebellion: Jerusalem - now renamed Courtland - is the county seat of Southampton, VA. It was where the rebellion happened and was brutally put down, with up to 200 slaves killed\nThe rebels then went to the house of Salathul Francis 600 yards away and murdered him with 'repeated blows to the head'.\nNext they marched in 'perfect silence' to the house of a Mrs. Reese and murdered her in her sleep.\nThe Confessions says: 'Her son awoke, but it was only to sleep the sleep of death, he had only time to say who is that, and he was no more.'\nBy the time the group reached the house of Mrs. Turner the sun was coming up.\nThey used an axe to break the front door down and Will killed Mrs. Turner with one blow.\nThe Confessions says: 'I (Turner) took Mrs. Newsome by the hand, and with the sword I had when I was apprehended, I struck her several blows over the head, but not being able to kill her, as the sword was dull.\nShe remained on her hiding place till just before the arrival of a party, who were in pursuit of the murderers, when she came down and fled to a swamp, where, a mere child as she was, with the horrors of the late scene before her, she lay concealed until the next day, when seeing a party go up to the house, she came up, and on being asked how she escaped, replied with the utmost simplicity: 'The Lord helped her.' The Confessions of Nat Turner\n'Will turning around and discovering it, despatched (sic) her also. A general destruction of property and search for money and ammunition, always succeeded the murders.'\nThe rebels, who by now numbered 24, nine of whom were on horseback, continued on to the next house, stopping only to murder another man.\nThe Confessions says: 'As I came round to the door I saw Will pulling Mrs. Whitehead out of the house, and at the step he nearly severed her head from her body, with his broad axe.\n'Miss Margaret, when I discovered her, had concealed herself in the corner, formed by the projection of the cellar cap from the house; on my approach she fled, but was soon overtaken, and after repeated blows with a sword, I killed her by a blow on the head, with a fence rail.'\nThe most shocking killing took place at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Waller where 10 children were butchered because as they had gathered there to attend school.\nOne girl hid up a chimney and listened while her friends and her sister were butchered around her.\nThe Confessions says: 'As their teacher had not arrived, they were at play in the yard, and seeing the negroes approach, (she) ran up on a dirt chimney and remained there unnoticed during the massacre of the eleven that were killed at this place.\n'She remained on her hiding place till just before the arrival of a party, who were in pursuit of the murderers, when she came down and fled to a swamp, where, a mere child as she was, with the horrors of the late scene before her, she lay concealed until the next day, when seeing a party go up to the house, she came up, and on being asked how she escaped, replied with the utmost simplicity: \"The Lord helped her.\"'\nWith the rampage well into its second day, the rebels went to the house of William Williams and, having killed him and his two sons, they went looking for his wife.\nMemento: Nat Turner's Bible, which he was said to be holding when he was captured after two months on the run. It has been displayed at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, part of the Smithsonian collection in Washington DC\nThe Confessions says: 'Mrs. Williams fled and got some distance from the house, but she was pursued, overtaken, and compelled to get up behind one of the company, who brought her back, and after showing her the mangled body of her lifeless husband, she was told to get down and lay by his side, where she was shot dead.'\nTurner describes some killings with nonchalance, noting that 'Mrs. Vaughan was the next place we visited - and after murdering the family here I determined on starting for (the town of) Jerusalem'.\nThe town is now named Courtland.\nAt times he appears to revel in the mayhem and says that it was 'my object to carry terror and devastation wherever we went'.\nHe writes: 'I sometimes got in sight in time to see the work of death completed, viewed the mangled bodies as they lay, in silent satisfaction, and immediately started in quest of other victims'.\nThe Confessions says that at their height the rebels amounted to 50 or 60 slaves armed with guns, axes, swords and clubs.\nBut by that point the alarm had been sounded and most white families had fled, leaving them 'no more victims to gratify our thirst for blood'.\nWhite militias were also roaming the area and the rebels broke up, forcing Turner to hide under a pile of fence rails for six weeks, only venturing out at night to get food.\nHe was eventually arrested after being captured at gunpoint by a farmer.\nGray supposedly wrote down The Confessions on November 5, 1831 as Turner was waiting for his trial.\nThe cover claims they were 'fully and voluntarily' made and an 'authentic account'.\nGray was a former slave owner and former magistrate who had lost his fortune due to gambling debts and started practicing law, so no doubt saw Turner's account as a way to get out of debt.\nWhether or not it was actually what Turner told him is a matter for debate.\nIn 'American Slave Revolts and Conspiracies: A Reference Guide: A Reference Guide', by Kerry Walters she writes that 'the consensus is that it manages to capture Turner's voice more often than not'.\nIn 'Nat Turner: A Slave Rebellion in History and Memory', Kenneth S. Greenberg notes that even local newspaper the Richmond Enquirer doubted the Confessions because it was too well written, although Turner was educated.\nGreenberg says there is 'considerable evidence within the document of its accuracy' and says that it was entirely based on new material.\nThe account also matched the sequence of Turner's life meaning that Gray would have had to carry out extensive research in order to fake it.\nDepiction: The Nat Turner rebellion movie The Birth of a Nation will offer a version of how slaves - and their masters - lived in antebellum Virginia\nReligion: Nat Turner was a preacher before he became a rebel and was said to be holding his Bible when he was captured\nIn 'The Land Shall Be Deluged in Blood: A New History of the Nat Turner Revolt', historian Patrick H. Breen notes that after the Confessions were taken down other whites examined Turner and found him credible.\nBreen writes that six judges signed Turner's Confessions and said that they were 'full, free and voluntary', though of course they may well have been racist.\nGray was so keen to get the book published that he missed Turner's execution and the day before he was in Alexandria, Virginia, getting the book trademarked.\nHe later found a publisher who helped the book sell 50,000 copies and needed a second print run because it was so popular.\nTurner's execution took place on November 11, 1831 and his body was flayed, quartered and beheaded.\nIn the wake of the rebellion The Virginia House of Delegates hosted a Slavery Debate in which 40 petitions signed by 2,000 people were put before lawmakers.\nBut the Delegates refused to make the law worse for blacks after some argued that slaves should be freed, showing the deep divisions within the state about slavery.\nHistorian Eric Foner has argued that Turner's revolt hastened the arrival of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 by Abraham Lincoln, which made freedom one of the aims of the Civil War, which had begun almost two years earlier.\nHe has claimed: 'Far from killing the debate, Nat Turner opened it.\n'In the closing months of 1831, petitions poured into the Virginia legislature from throughout the state.\n'Some called for the removal of all free blacks from the state blaming them for fomenting unrest among the slave; some demanded new restrictions on the black population; but many, arguing mainly from the fear and insecurity the Turner revolt had created and point to the continuing increase of the black population, called for the gradual emancipation of the slaves and their colonization outside the country.'\nNot all white: The Sundance success of The Birth of a Nation has led to speculation that it will be as successful at the Oscars in 2017 as 12 Years a Slave for which Lupita Nyong'o (center) won best supporting actress and which was named Best Picture\nBirth of a Nation, which takes the name from the 1915 racist epic by director D.W. Griffith, tackles these issues head on.\nThe opening lines are: 'I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever.'\nEven before being made the subject of the film, Turner's life has had a widespread impact on popular culture.\nHe has been referred to by rappers the Wu-Tang Clan, The Roots and Public Enemy as well as Tupac Shaker.\nIn 1967 novelist John Styron wrote his own 'Confessions of Nat Turner' which was was a controversial version of the story based on Turner's own supposed confession.\nReleased at the height of the civil rights era, it won the Pulitzer Prize but was criticized because Styron is white and he made out Turner to be a 'psychopathic monster' who was obsessed with sexually assaulting white women.\nIn response a group of black writers published a book a year later called 'The Second Crucifixion of Nat Turner'\nBirth of a Nation is already being compared to 12 Years a Slave, the biopic of Solomon Northup, a free man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery for 12 years in 1841 before being freed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421397/A-murdered-newborn-women-axed-death-bed-children-slaughtered-schoolroom-bloody-true-account-rebel-slave-inspired-movie.html"}
