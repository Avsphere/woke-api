In this new role, she will help lead, plan, execute and elevate our sports design across platforms. She has been charged with making sure we are experimenting and consistently doing championship quality work – whether or not the local teams are winning titles.\nOf course, she has already shown an ability to handle big events and a championship — with a heavy dose of both over the past six months. Virginia was a driving force in our digital, social and newspaper design work for our Capitals’ Stanley Cup coverage, the Olympics and the All-Star Game. Her collaborative approach ensures that our other Sports designers have a chance to shape our coverage and do their best work.\nVirginia’s hands-on design work is impactful and lasting. She handled numerous aspects of the Capitals’ run, including the Stanley Cup preview package, clinching cover and commemorative special section cover. Tom Boswell tweeted that her All-Star Game preview cover was “… the most original, memorable front page to any Special Section for any sports event that I can recall.”\nVirginia has produced standout work since she joined The Post in 2014, including the live Muhammad Ali obit package , the Quince Orchard story in print and online and “ A Marine’s Conviction .” She earned two print portfolio awards and a silver medal from the Society for News Design print competition this past year. She joined The Post from the Minneapolis Star Tribune and worked in several news sections before moving to Sports more than two years ago.\nPlease join us in congratulating Virginia.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2018/07/31/virginia-singarayar-becomes-senior-designer/"}
