By midday, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index was flat, at 19,578.06.\nSpecialist Edward Loggie works at his post as a television screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shows the decision of the Federal Reserve, Wednesday, March 15, 2017.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)\nThe central bank is buying about 80 trillion yen ($700 billion) a year of Japanese government bonds to inject more cash into the economy. Interest rates are near zero, the aim is to use expectations of inflation to stimulate more spending and borrowing by businesses and consumers.\nThe BOJ said in a statement that the economy, which grew at a 1 percent annual pace in 2016, was still on a \"moderate recovery trend.\"\nThe Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate 0.25 percentage points to a range of 0.75 to 1 percent on Wednesday in a show of confidence in the economy. It signaled the likelihood of additional rate hikes later this year.\nThe 19-nation eurozone has been much more tentative about \"tapering\" let alone tightening policy. In December, the European Central Bank decided to continue bond purchases through the end of 2017 while reducing them from 80 billion euros ($84 billion) a month to 60 billion euros a month beginning in April.\nLast week, the ECB decided not to change the size or duration of its stimulus programs, judging a rise in annual inflation to near its own 2 percent target to reflect increased oil prices rather than other more expansionary factors, such as higher wages for workers.\nWhile many indicators show the U.S. economy picking up steam, conditions in slower-growing Europe and Japan remain iffy.\nThe BOJ cited the impact of the Fed's moves and other developments in the U.S. as risks.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4318752/Japans-central-bank-holds-steady-rate-stimulus.html"}
