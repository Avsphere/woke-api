Some $29 billion worth of furniture and over $11 billion in vehicle imports will also be hit.\nKey targeted products in US trade war USTR, US Census, UBS estimates/Business Insider\nWhile these are only proposed tariffs, if implemented, they point to higher prices for both US businesses and consumers.\nTao Wang, Economist at UBS, says there's little to suggest the US won't follow through with its threat in the absence of a suitable deal with China.\n\"We expect these tariffs to be imposed in September as there is little reason for the US to back down since tough trade actions seem to be boosting the President's popular support according to polls and the US economy is strong,\" she says.\n\"We think it likely that this current escalation becomes reality, but don't see it degenerating soon into an all-out trade war â€” defined as US imposing significant tariffs on all Chinese exports and China does the same plus serious non-tariff barriers.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-imports-ustr-tariffs-largest-impact-2018-7"}
