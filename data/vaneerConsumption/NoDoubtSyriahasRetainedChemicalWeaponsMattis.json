We’ve made that very clear with our strike.”\nAn Israeli assessment has found that Assad’s regime was still in possession of “a few tonnes” of chemical weapons, a military official confirmed.\nAssad, backed by his ally Russia, has strongly denied the allegation that his forces used chemical weapons against the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun on April 4, describing it as a “100 percent fabrication”.\nHe has said repeatedly that his forces turned over all chemical weapons stockpiles in 2013, under a deal brokered by Russia to avoid threatened US military action.\nThe agreement was later enshrined in a UN Security Council resolution.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2017/04/21/no-oubt-syria-retained-chemical-weapons-mattis/"}
