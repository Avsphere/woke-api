For this, the leftist elites have their dander up in a big way. Some of the many talented, wealthy, privileged African-Americans who are members of the Academy are so angry that they are going to boycott the awards this year. So are many of the not African-Americans, of course. Many of them truly do think everything is about them, that the world revolves around them and their work. On the weekend of Martin Luther King's birthday, these folks had him turning over in his grave. King's wish for everyone to be judged by the \"content of their character\" has been smashed to smithereens during the seven years of the Obama administration. Under Obama, everything is about skin color. Everything. Not character, not merit, not good citizenship, only race. Is the Academy membership racist? It is not – not for a moment. No...

icans are about thirteen percent of the American population. One point seven percent of our population is gay. Does anyone actually think these groups are underrepresented in our culture? Our music, our television programs, our films? No. The entertainment industry is legendary for its efforts to be interracial, inter-everybody. It has been for at least four decades. These groups are overrepresented by design, and for good reason. People hardly notice race anymore. Certainly our younger generations do not. They would hardly notice their friends' skin color if it were not for their teachers and university professors separating them out by race and sexual orientation and indicting them for their \"privilege\" if they happen to be Caucasian. It goes without saying that we are blessed with many millions of gifted and talented African-Americans, gays, Asian-Americans, Hispanic Americans, etc. But this socialist/communist quest for absolute equality in all things is just plain silly. If three quarters of the nominees had been non-white, would white people be boycotting the Oscars? Not in a million years. They would be congratulating those nominees for their achievement and congratulating themselves on their superior inclusiveness as an institution, for ending racism. All the industry really cares about anyway is the financial bottom line. Bring in the bucks; no one cares what your ethnicity is. Not one bit. They will boycott you if you are a conservative Republican, but not for your skin color. President Obama's race-based presidency has done terrible damage to the nation, especially to minorities, who, for seven years, have been inculcated with the absolutist decree that they are victims. Nothing victimizes a person more than being taught that he or she is a victim, and teaching exactly that is Obama's métier. Obama's background is chock-full of identity politics and race-hustling activism. He sides with criminals over the police if the criminals are black or illegal immigrants. And yet he ignores the catastrophe of black-on-black crime while striving to take guns away from law-abiding citizens. He refuses to call Islamic terrorism by its name, nor does he ever actually condemn it, but he takes the side of #OccupyWallStreet and #BlackLivesMatter. Both groups are Soros-funded and peopled with thugs who have no clue what they are \"protesting.\" Their paying job is to foment racial strife. So it is no wonder that minorities of any stripe, in any profession or line of work, have learned to be angry for not being represented with absolute equality in all things. As for the Oscars, there is most assuredly no racist conspiracy beyond the financial bottom line; this is the season when public relations firms with film studio clients get rich. Oscar-winning films bring in the bucks. Why Michael B. Jordan was not nominated for his role in Creed is a mystery, but it probably has more to do with lazy voters and/or late screeners than anything else. All of those privileged members of the Academy, whatever their skin color, should grow up and thank their lucky stars for the privilege of working in one of the most privileged professions in the world.","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/01/the_unbearable_weight_of_privilege.html"}
