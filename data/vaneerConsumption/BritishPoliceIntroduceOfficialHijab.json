It’s a productive thing on behalf of Police Scotland to make the organisation be seen to be inclusive.”\n“From SPMA’s point of view, we’re fully supportive. Under-representation is an issue Police Scotland is trying to address. I couldn’t give you a definitive answer as to why it’s an issue.\n“It’s not just the Muslim community, but in different communities across Scotland there will be cultural barriers to joining certain organisations. But we’re looking to see how we can break down those barriers.”\nThe Liberal Democrats recently described the representation of non-white and Muslim people in the police as “appalling”, and said it was time for immediate action.\nIt followed a submission to the Scottish Parliament’s equal opportunities committee from the SPF, a staff association, which said Police Scotland was merely paying “lip service” to the issue of ethnic minority recruitment.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/06/08/british-police-introduce-official-hijab-will-anything-diversity/"}
