Popular securities are defined as \"those that people tend to like and therefore are willing to hold even if the returns are relatively modest.\"\nHe adds that risk alone is not enough to account for a security's popularity, and suggests four other factors that contribute to unpopularity. The first and main factor he notes is \"economic\" or the possibility that a security \"might not be able to make required current payments, that these payments might not prove as valuable as expected\" or \"that projected future payments might be less than anticipated.\"\nOther sources of unpopularity include structure (or how the security is packaged), restrictions (the barriers to ownership), and behavioral (the psychological aspects of ownerships).\nAdvisors Can Improve Their Presentation Skills In Several Ways (The Wall Street Journal)\nThere are several ways to improve your presentation skills. First, an advisor must deliver a concise message. Clients don't want to hear all the fancy words and details — they just want to know the bottom line.\n\"Be mindful of what time of the day you are speaking. Advisers need to adjust their energy depending on the hour. A morning audience is more alert and energized while an after-lunch presentation may require more audience interaction and energy from the adviser to keep everyone engaged,\" Karol Ward, a communication consultant, told the WSJ.\nAdditionally, it's important to consider what people you are speaking to. Specifically, keep in mind the clients' income levels, how they spend money, and what they are concerned about. Adjust the details of your speech so that it applies specifically to them.\nThere Are Still Plenty of Concerns About Investing In Chinese Companies (Financial Planning)\nMany experts are still concerned over investing in China. They're nervous about the \"lack of transparency, and warnings about a possible bank or property crisis\" in China — and thus advise staying out for now.\nAdditionally, Patricia Oey, a senior analyst and manager of research at Morningstar, warns that China is \"'still a communist country,' where most large enterprises are still owned by the state — either the central or provincial governments — and as such they can often be 'asked to do things that are not necessarily for the good of shareholders.'\"\nHowever, those still looking into China need to look at companies that \"understand the Chinese consumer, and that address all the pent-up demand of the millions of new people entering middle class — the travel industry, financial services and education,\" according to Peter Engardio.\nJP Morgan Broker Who Produced $2 Million In Revenue Just Got Hired By Morgan Stanley (Wealth Management)\nPeter Risch from JP Morgan Securities in Columbus, Ohio produced $2 million in revenue last year, and managed $250 million in client assets.\nReuters records show that Morgan Stanley recently hired seven \"high-producing\" brokers in late August.
