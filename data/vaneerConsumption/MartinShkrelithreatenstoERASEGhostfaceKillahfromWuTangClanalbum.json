'At least 500 words, no grammatical errors and Shaolin stays intact.'\nShkreli also taunted Ghostface Killah in a video obtained by TMZ in which the widely detested New York businessman sips from a drink surrounded by three masked, hooded goons who brandished a silver engraved box said to hold the one-of-a-kind album.\n'If you ever say some dumb s*** again, this album, this \"Shaolin,\" I'm going to erase all your s*** from this album, you understand?\n'I'm going to erase you from the record books of rap,' Shkreli says, calling the 45-year-old Ghostface Killah 'an old man that's lost his relevance,' and addressing him by his 'government name,' Dennis.\n'You have to listen to me,' he adds. 'Without me, you're nothing.'\nHis threat came after Ghostface Killah spoke dismissively of Shkreli, referring to him as 'Pee Wee Herman' and 'Michael Jackson nose kid' when speaking to TMZ.\nBold statement: Shkreli said he was going to erase Ghostface Killah (pictured) 'from the record books of rap' for his insults\nBack in the day: Ghostface Killah, The GZA and Method Man of Wu-Tang Clan performing live in January 2008\nHolding up his phone displaying a closeup photo of Shkreli, Ghostface Killah says in the footage: 'I'm just laughing off of the dude's face. I mean, come on, man, look at that smile.'\nThe rapper, who appeared to be speaking extemporaneously after being approached on a Los Angeles street, denounced Shkreli for the 5,000-percent rise in the Daraprim drug's price.\nGhostface Killah said that 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin' should belong instead to 'the people' but said the issue was out of his control.\nThe influential New York rap ensemble had made only one copy of the album, which was stored in a vault in Morocco until Shkreli bought it for $2million.\nRZA, generally seen as the leader of the Wu-Tang Clan, earlier said that the sale of the album was completed before the infamous price hike and that some proceeds would go to charity.\nShkreli may have been imitating a video in July in which Ghostface Killah threatened younger rapper Action Bronson for criticizing the elder rapper's recent output.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421697/Bad-boy-CEO-threatens-edit-Wu-Tang-album.html"}
