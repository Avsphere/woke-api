Even in the face of a transfer ban they want Neymar; they wanted Lionel Messi before – with three separate proposals according to a recent report – and before him they wanted, and signed, Luis Figo.\nAnd while Madrid tug on one end of the rope, Barca do their best to hold the other end tighter than ever. This week Catalan paper ARA claimed that at the end of this season Messi will almost double his money from a net salary of £17.4m a year to £30m. The Argentine is understood to dispute those figures and be considering legal action.\nWhat does not seem beyond dispute is that Barcelona are under obligation to reassess Messi's contract at two-year intervals. Diario AS suggested, meanwhile, that Neymar’s salary is set to rise as Messi’s does. They claim Neymar’s annual net pay will go from £16.6m per year to £17.4m.\nFlorentino Perez (left) would love to pull off another major signing from great rivals Barcelona\nThe Portuguese spent five years playing at the Nou Camp before crossing the divide\nAll rises are to help keep them from the clutches of the Premier League and from a fate worse than the English top flight – Real Madrid.\nThe bad feeling over Florentino Perez signing Figo in 2000 still resonates. Barcelona complained to FIFA last summer when Figo was due to line-up in a Barca legends XI before the Champions League final. They didn’t want him wearing the shirt having sullied it once and forever by crossing the great divide 16 years ago.\nPerez knows that another Figo-style raid will be more difficult than ever to pull-off but it doesn’t stop him trying. Messi’s emotional ties to Barca who signed him as a 13-year-old with a growth hormone deficiency problem mean he will probably never play for another European club much less Real Madrid.\nBut Cadena Cope claimed recently that there have been at least four attempts to sign Messi since 2011. With intermediaries representing Real Madrid trying to take advantage of, or even create, instability around the Argentine.\nThere was a famous moment in 2003 when Barcelona supporters hurled a pig's head in the direction of Figo\nThe pig's head can be seen on the floor just to the left of the corner flag in this picture as Figo takes the kick\nCadena Cope claim that when in 2011 Cristiano Ronaldo was linked to a move to Manchester City there was an attempt to bring Messi. In 2013 they tried again after missing out on Neymar and that they made a third attempt last season.\nIt’s an open secret in Spain that Barcelona’s greatest ever player has been approached by those claiming to represent Real Madrid.\nAt the recent Ballon d’Or gala something similar happened again but this time Neymar was the target – a sign of the times that even in cross-clasico tapping up the Brazilian is slowly replacing the Argentine.\nIt was a story that broke on another Spanish radio station Onda Cero. They claimed intermediaries acting for Real Madrid had met with the Brazilian in Zurich at the Ballon d’Or ceremony.\nFigo is the last player to switch directly between the two clubs but it isn't for the want of trying on Real's behalf\nIt is an open secret in Spain that Real have attempted to lure Lionel Messi to the Santiago Bernabeu\nNeymar's father dismissed the story as 'daft' and a 'total invention' the following day saying that he was staying with Barca officials in the same hotel as Real Madrid officials and that it was normal that they would greet each other. He also reaffirmed the player's intention to renew his contract at Barcelona at the end of the season.\nReal Madrid’s interest in Neymar dates back to when they took took him on trial as a 14-year-old when the player’s agent at the time, Wagner Ribeiro, was so convinced Real Madrid would want to sign him that he paid for the player’s trip to Spain.\nHe wowed the watching Madrid coaches and scouts in a trial game and Real were desperate to sign him and agreed to bring his entire family to Spain but there were elections at the club and the chain of command ultimately dithered over the then 60,000 dollars fee allowing other clubs to enter the fray with Barcelona ultimately winning the race.\nThe Argentine is unlikely to ever leave Barcelona let alone to join fierce rivals Real Madrid\nReal Madrid also have designs on Barcelona's new golden boy Neymar (right)\nRamon Calderon was the president when the club missed out on the young Neymar and Florentino Perez would love to succeed where his predecessor failed.\nBut as with the pursuit of Messi, there is a sense in which, even if ultimately Real miss out on the player, their efforts are never for nothing. Every scrap of Real interest in Neymar and Messi increases the pressure on Barcelona to keep them financially happy.\nThe more expensive the contract renewal the more Barca will be financially stretched. They are already the wrong side of their self-imposed financial regulations, established to maintain the wage bill at a controllable percentage of the club's turnover.\nReal Madrid's attempts to sign Neymar, like with Messi, are likely to prove futile\nBarca manager Luis Enrique affirmed last week he expects Neymar to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp\nThey are also having to sort out a shirt sponsor for next season with the £46m-a-year deal with Qatar Airways stalled. The club have briefed that they have three rival offers from three different continents but none are likely to top the verbal agreement they appeared to have with Qatar at the end of last season.\nDo Real Madrid want Messi and Neymar? Yes they do. Have they poked the cage at various intervals over the last five years? Yes they have. Will either player ever wear the white shirt? Messi almost definitely not; Neymar probably not, at least in the near future.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3422786/Real-Madrid-love-pull-Luis-Figo-style-raid-Barcelona-despite-efforts-land-Lionel-Messi-Neymar-fierce-rivals-stars-remain-reach.html"}
