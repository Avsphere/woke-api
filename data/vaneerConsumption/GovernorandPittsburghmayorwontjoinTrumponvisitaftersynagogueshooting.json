(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\nPennsylvania's governor and Pittsburgh's mayor both say they will not join President Donald Trump during his scheduled trip to Pittsburgh.\nTrump faces an uneasy welcome Tuesday afternoon in the anguished community of Squirrel Hill, home to the Tree of Life synagogue where 11 people were gunned down during Sabbath services on Saturday.\nDemocratic Gov. Tom Wolf's campaign spokeswoman, Beth Melena, says the governor based his decision on input from the victims' families who told him they did not want the president to be there on the day their loved ones were being buried.\nDemocratic Mayor Bill Peduto says he also won't greet Trump.\nPeduto earlier said the White House ought to consult with the families of the victims about their preferences and asked that the president not come during a funeral.\n11 a.m. UPDATE: Synagogue shooter was obsessed with Jewish refugee agency, online records show\nThis undated Pennsylvania Department of Transportation photo shows Robert Bowers, the suspect in the deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation via AP)\nJust moments before the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that left 11 people dead, the suspect is believed to have posted a final social media rant against a Jewish refugee settlement agency most people had never heard of, but which has increasingly become the target of right-wing rage and conspiracy theories.\n\"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,\" Robert Gregory Bowers wrote on the platform Gab early Saturday. \"I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"\nThe group, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, was founded in 1881 in a Manhattan storefront to assist Jews persecuted in Russia and Eastern Europe. HIAS is now among nine groups that contract with the State Department to help refugees settle in the United States, and it has recently clashed with the Trump administration over policies that have throttled the flow of such newcomers.\nLeaders of HIAS and the group's Pittsburgh affiliate vowed to continue their work.\n\"We were the perfect target for this murderer, because we're Jewish and we help refugees. So he gets to check off the two hate boxes,\" Mark Hetfield, president and CEO of HIAS, told a news conference Tuesday in Pittsburgh.\nHetfield said HIAS is getting flooded with donations, with more coming in from non-Jews around the world than Jews for the first time in the organization's history.\nAnalysts who follow the extreme right say the fixation some extremists have with HIAS appears to be fueled by a mix of anti-Semitism and the recent caustic rhetoric about an immigrant caravan trudging slowly toward the United States.\nSpecifically, they believe Bowers ascribed to the \"white genocide\" conspiracy, which holds that Jews are prominent among the forces seeking to destroy the \"white race\" by bringing in non-white people. The Gab.com account believed to be Bowers' includes several recent postings or re-postings critical of HIAS.\nBased in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Silver Spring, HIAS has an annual operating budget of $42 million and receives about half of its money from the federal government. It has resettled refugees of different faiths from Afghanistan, Vietnam, Iran and elsewhere. Among the thousands of people it has aided are Google co-founder Sergey Brin and singer Regina Spektor.\nAs the Trump administration restricted the number of refugees allowed into the U.S., HIAS and its local affiliates went from resettling 4,191 refugees in 2016 to 1,632 for the fiscal year that just ended.\nThough HIAS strongly supports the rights of asylum seekers to a fair hearing, it has no connection to the immigrant caravan, said spokesman Bill Swersey.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/oct/30/synagogue-shooter-was-obsessed-jewish-refugee-agen/?page=1"}
