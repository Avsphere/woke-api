Anyone who sees him is asked to call 911 immediately. Anyone with any information that can help find him is asked to call 770-477-4479.\nThe girl’s family told Channel 2 Action News after the incident last Wednesday that the man who stole the mother’s car realized the girl was in the backseat and let her out a few miles down the road. She then flagged down another car and called for help.\nShe was later taken to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston to be checked out, Channel 2 reported.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/man-sought-abduction-sexual-assault-year-old-girl-clayton/OC8lseXRQCKI7exD3aGGML/"}
