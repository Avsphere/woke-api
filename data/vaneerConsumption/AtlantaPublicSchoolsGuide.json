The district includes 97 schools and programs, including 16 charter schools.\nIn July 2016, the district became a charter system, a way of organizing school operations that gave the district freedom from some state regulations and is intended to delegate some decisions about schools to local, school-level governance teams. As part of the new system, each high school and the schools that feed into it developed themes for their cluster. The themes include International Baccalaureate; science, technology, engineering and math; and preparation for college and careers.\nThis school year, at least 18 schools will have new principals. Three new schools will open as the result of mergers or closure. They include Michael R. Hollis Innovation Academy, which replaces Bethune Elementary; Tuskegee Airman Global Academy, the result of merging Venetian Hills Elementary and Connally Elementary; and Woodson Park Academy, the result of merging Woodson Elementary and Grove Park Intermediate Elementary. Thomasville Heights Elementary School is being operated by a charter school-affiliated group rather than school district staff.\nHealth clinics modeled after an existing clinic at Whitefoord Elementary School are opening at two more schools, Miles and Dobbs Elementary schools. And a new in-house police force, instead of Atlanta Police Department officers, will provide school security this year.\nThere’s a districtwide back-t0-school fair on July 30 and individual schools will hold open houses on Aug. 1.\nSuperintendent: Meria Carstarphen\nCarstarphen became Atlanta Public Schools superintendent in 2014. She previously served as superintendent of the Austin, Texas, and Saint Paul, Minnesota, school districts.\nSchool board\nFind information about your school board members.\nWatch board meetings online.\nFirst day of school\nWednesday, Aug. 3.\nBus routes\nFind information about bus routes.\nCalendar (2016-17)\nSeptember 5 Labor Day\nOctober 7 Teacher Professional Learning Day\nOctober 10-11 Fall Break/Columbus Day\nNovember 8 Election Day/Teacher Professional Learning Day\nNovember 21-25 Thanksgiving Break\nDecember 19-31 Semester Break\nJanuary 2 Semester Break\nJanuary 3 Teacher Professional Learning Day\nJanuary 16 M.L.
