One would-be victim got away and notified police.\nThe operator of the website serialkillersink.net says he got the painting through a third party. It's priced at $200.\nAn Ohio prisons spokeswoman says death row inmates can't sell items for profit, but are allowed to send artwork to family and friends.\n___\nInformation from: Akron Beacon Journal, http://www.ohio.com","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4301380/Painting-condemned-Ohio-killer-offered-sale-online.html"}
