His poodles walk together, marching like soldiers and doing everything he says on command, reports the People’s Daily Online.\nMr Dai from Qingdao, Shandong Province was filmed on the street by a passerby. His pet poodles followed his order to heel, sit and stands on their hind legs at exactly the same time.\nThe five dogs cautiously watch their owner (left). On command they sit on their hind legs looking up (right)\nAttention: These poodles have been military trained to do everything their owner says on command in China\nSpeaking to China Central Television, Mr Dai said: ‘The highest level is not for a human to train dogs, but for dogs to train humans.\n‘For example, if they want to go to the toilet, though they can’t talk, they have certain body languages to communicate. If you fail to understand then it is harder to communicate with the pets,’ he said.\nThe 40-second amateur footage shows Mr Dai walking with his five dogs. They all stop and sit at the same time, then they all put both of their front paws up towards him.\nHe moves to the side and they all lie down. After another command they stand up again.\nAbout ten seconds after the final command, the bigger dog in front walks off on his hind legs and the other four follow.\nDuring the video Mr Dai is heard saying: ‘Attention, stop, forward, and lie down.’\nMr Dai started serious training after one of the dogs - named Duo Bi - behaved really badly when he brought it to visit a friend.\nA naughty Duo Bi jumped up onto the table and knocked over his friend’s flask, spilling the contents inside.\nThis made Mr Dai feel like he needed to properly train his pets well from then on.\nImpressive: As the others follow, the front bigger dog walks on his hind legs after Mar Dao's command\nWhen he got more poodles - all the same colour as Duo Bi - he started teaching them hard-core training drills regularly.\nThese included teaching them to walk on their hind legs, lying down, and even doing mathematics.\nWhen he asks Duo Bi, ‘what’s two times three?’ the four-year-old pet barks six times.\nThen he asks, ‘what’s ten minus two?’ amazingly the pooch barks eight times.\nHe makes sure at all times that the bigger dog stays at the top of the line moving closer to the other four, before commanding him it to lead the group away.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3393969/Attention-Pet-owner-caught-giving-five-poodles-military-training-streets.html"}
