Surely Twitter isn't good for his blood pressure?\nThe Beverley Hills home of the late Charlton Heston has been sold for Â£8.4million. It featured in Michael Moore's prize-winning anti-gun documentary Bowling for Columbine.\nMoore arrived there unannounced in 2001 and persuaded Heston to speak about firearms.\nBy then, pro-gun Heston, who died aged 84 in 2008, had Alzheimer's disease.
