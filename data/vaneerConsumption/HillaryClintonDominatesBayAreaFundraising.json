Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Dr. Ben Carson have topped their Republican counterparts in Bay Area fundraising, followed by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\nMeanwhile, Democratic candidate and self-proclaimed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has raised $1.12 million in the Bay Area, which is more than each of the Republican candidates has raised, but reportedly about one-fifth of what Clinton has raised.\nBillionaire Donald Trump has been mostly self-funding his campaign, but the love of his supporters earned him $3.9 million nationally, according to third quarter earnings that were posted in mid-October. Carson raised $20 million nationwide in the quarter, and Bush raised $13.4 million, while Cruz clocked in at $12 million, Fiorina at $6.8 million and Rubio at $6 million in Q3.\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz and on Facebook.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/02/hillary-clinton-dominates-bay-area-fundraising/"}
