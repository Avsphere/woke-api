We’re making major capital investments to execute a series of new offerings—one of which Breitbart will announce this week.”\nOne driver of the company’s explosive traffic trajectory has been its dominance across social media. Breitbart has the number one political Facebook and Twitter pages in the world, according to analytics giant NewsWhip. Yet unlike many competitors, says Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, the company’s primary traffic is not disproportionately beholden to social media; it comes from destination traffic.\n“Establishment media—the same folks who laughed off Donald Trump—are mystified by what makes Breitbart the powerhouse we’ve become,” said Marlow. “We’ve built an authentic, deeply-rooted community where people come to hang out to join in the conversation that’s taking place 24 hours a day.”\nMarlow added: “It’s a beautiful, loud, intensely savvy 45 million-person community where we read first-in-class reporting devoid of establishment spin and then discuss, debate, and share what it all means with the world.”\nWhen Breitbart relaunched its website in 2012, the publisher generated roughly 12 million pageviews a month. Today, Breitbart receives more pageviews in a single month than it previously did in an entire year.\nThat trend is likely to continue globally. With bureaus in London, Jerusalem, Washington, California, and Texas, Breitbart is in the process of establishing news bureaus in France and Germany.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2017/01/09/breitbart-news-45-trafficked-u-s-website-beats-huffpo-wapo-foxnews-2-billion-pageviews-2016/"}
