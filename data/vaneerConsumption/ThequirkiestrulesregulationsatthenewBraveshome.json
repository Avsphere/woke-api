Some are weird.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution combed through and picked out some of the highlights.\nHere’s what we found:\nAAA to the rescue!\nIf it turns out that old jalopy of yours only had one more Chipper Jones Bobblehead Night left in it, don’t sweat. The AAA Club will provide free emergency road service to those in stadium parking during or after any home games.\nThem’s fightin’ words — and them’s not allowed\nMost people can guess all the middle school-level humor you’re not allowed to have on a sign or piece of clothing when entering SunTrust. What you may not guess is that any sign, banner or article of clothing containing “fighting words” is a no-go, according to the Braves website. If you have something deemed to contain “fighting words” on it, your options are to remove the item, cover it or leave.\n»RELATED: Insider’s guide to Smyrna\nCoolers are not cool\nContrary to the initial announcement, you can now bring food into the ballpark. But don’t bring it in a cooler. Ice chests, hard-sided coolers and soft-sided coolers are not allowed at SunTrust Park.\nGet something out of being a designated driver\nThe Braves have made it easier to convince a friend to be your group’s designated driver. Delaware North Sportservice — the folks managing food and drinks at the stadium — will give your non-drinker a complimentary 12 ounce bottle of a Coca-Cola product from the “Designated Driver Booth” located at the left field gate entrance or any guest services booth located within the ballpark. So, cheers! (Except that one person.)\nWhen the Atlanta Braves officially open the season at their new stadium in Cobb County The Braves will allow outside food into SunTrust Park So long as it fits in a clear, gallon-size container Fans should make sure they aren't carrying any prohibited items such as: Alcoholic beverages Large bags Ice chests Or drones Read the full prohibited items list at AJC.com\nFree mystery fan pack\nIf you register at braves.com/fanpack, the Braves will send you a “complimentary fan pack” “while supplies last.” The guide doesn’t say how the selection process works or what is in the fan pack. Everyone could get a coupon for one free hug from Hank Aaron, but that’s unlikely.\nNeed help? Text the Braves.\nIf you need assistance while in the ballpark or want to report a rowdy fan, text “Braves Issue and Location” to 69050.\nSame-day certification\nYou may get hit in the face while trying, but it may be worth it if you get a foul or homerun ball. To get it certified so friends, family and pawn shop brokers believe you, head to the guest services window in Section 111 during the game for an official certificate.\nSunTrust Park has your back, celiac\nFor those abstaining from a persnickety family of wheat proteins, the gluten-free concessions stand in Section 149 is the place to be. Keep your nose on high alert for other gluten-free options throughout the ballpark in the form of fries, nachos, Cracker Jacks, peanuts, popcorn and Angry Orchard cider.\nThrifty 'n’ thirsty\nIf you’re into free stuff, you’re going to love this one. The purchase of a ticket in the Coca-Cola Corner — that’s left field sections 345, 346 or 347 — comes with a free 20 ounce Coke product.\nKids Club\nFor $25 a season, children ages 14 and under can join the Atlanta Braves Kids Club.
