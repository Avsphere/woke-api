In 2010, when the last World Cup took place in South Africa, Facebook had just 500 million users. Now there are just that many soccer fans (people who have \"liked\" a team or a player) on the site, the company says.\nUsers can get to the World Cup hub by clicking on \"World Cup\" in the list of trending topics on the site. In a nod to Twitter, Facebook, earlier this year, began displaying trending topics to show users the most popular topics at any given moment.\nFacebook, which counts 81 percent of its users outside the U.S. and Canada, is unveiling its World Cup features at a time when the company is working to become a place for more real-time, public conversations about big eventsâ€” a la Twitter. Such events attract big advertising dollars, though the company is not saying how much money it expects to make from World Cup-related ads.\nNot to be outdone, Twitter touted that the \"the only real-time #WorldCup global viewing party will be on Twitter, where you can track all 64 matches, experience every goal and love every second, both on and off the pitch.\" Fans can use the hashtag #WorldCup to tweet about the games and follow official accounts such as @FIFAWorldCup, @ussoccer for the U.S. team.\nThe World Cup is the planet's most widely viewed sporting event. According to FIFA, soccer's world body, an estimated 909.6 million TV viewers watched at least one minute of the 2010 final in which Spain beat the Netherlands. Nearly 900 million watched at least part of the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/world-cup/facebook-twitter-look-score-soccer-world-cup-features-n127351"}
