The front page story appropriately covered the whitewashing of the Krog Street Tunnel graffiti.\nCallahan has since continued printed editions of The Tiny AJC, coinciding with the debut of each new tiny door.\n“I thought creating The Tiny AJC would be a unique way to interact with the tiny doors while also creating a whole new canvas for sharing imagery and happenings in Atlanta,” he said.\nTiny Doors ATL has so far placed six different doors around the city, with more planned. The artist cooperative's intricately designed projects have become an interactive part of the community, and not just from Callahan.\nFor example, in December the cooperative installed a tiny door outside Inman Park Pet Works, complete with a tiny pet door. Not long after, someone tacked tiny fliers to the tiny door’s tiny bulletin board.\n“That was the kicker for us,\" Anderson said, \"to see people participating and making the installation their own was exactly the reaction we wanted.\"\nYou can stay abreast of future editions of The Tiny Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Instagram. And you can discover upcoming Tiny Doors ATL projects on Facebook or Instagram.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/mysterious-mini-ajcs-start-appearing-front-atlanta-tiny-doors/ru9KI0aHBwFzKxbfjmJ0dK/"}
