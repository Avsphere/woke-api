But that final stage, coming through West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire for the finish, it’s going to be a really hard stage.”\n#TdY Preview: Stage 1 Goathland climb aka Cow Wath Bank appears at 50km to go.

Here's our line up for @letouryorkshire which gets underway on Friday! #TDY pic.twitter.com/IKKV2rLPqa — Team Sky (@TeamSky) April 26, 2017\nOrganisers are learning every year when it comes to maximising Yorkshire’s terrain to produce an exciting race.\nWhereas 2015’s inaugural edition was effectively won on the opening day – with Team Sky protecting Lars Petter Nordhaug’s advantage for the next two days – last year, little separated the riders until a brutal stage three over the Moors saw Voeckler beat Sky’s Nicolas Roche to victory in Scarborough.\nWith tough stages to start and finish this year, the goal is to split the field up from day one but make sure nobody can feel too comfortable.\nJust seen the @letouryorkshire @ITV4 advert and I ❤️ it! Can't wait to race.. rode the course yesterday..it's going to be a battle for sure! pic.twitter.com/fpBaRRZGrh — Dani Rowe (@DaniKing1) April 25, 2017\nThe final stage will take Moses through his hometown. The race passed close by in 2015 as well, but the experience of racing on the roads he usually uses to train is still a strange one for the 24-year-old.\n“It is surreal,” he said. “They don’t seem like the same roads. There are so many people, rather than just you and the normal traffic. You have the whole road to race on, and it’s pretty unbelievable how different it feels.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4447346/Riders-facing-challenging-Tour-Yorkshire-route.html"}
