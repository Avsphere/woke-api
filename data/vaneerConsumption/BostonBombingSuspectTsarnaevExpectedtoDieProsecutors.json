The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nBoston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sent his mother an e-mail suggesting he expected to die in a confrontation with authorities, prosecutors said in court documents Tuesday.\nThe email — which ended by saying, \"If I don't see you in this life, I will will see you in the akhira,\" or afterlife — showed that Tsarnaev abandoned his expectation of privacy when he left his older brother's apartment with weapons and bombs three days after the bombings last year, prosecutors said.\nThat makes an FBI search of the apartment legal, prosecutors contended in documents filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston (PDF).\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, could face the death penalty if he's convicted of using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death for allegedly detonating pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the famous race on April 15, 2013.\nTsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police on April 18 after he and his brother met at the apartment, \"collected a small arsenal of weapons, including at least six bombs, a handgun and other weapons, then embarked on a murderous crime spree,\" the court filing says.\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorneys want a judge to throw out the search evidence from the Cambridge apartment and of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, saying they were illegal invasions of his privacy.\nProsecutors say the search of the apartment were proper, because Dzhokhar Tsarnaev relinquished any claim of privacy over its contents when he moved out in September 2011 and when the FBI circulated a photo of him as a suspect in the bombings.\nThe e-mail to his mother also showed that \"he did not expect to return alive, and this abandoned his expectation of privacy in everything he left behind,\" prosecutors argued.\n\"If I don't see you in this life, I will will see you in the akhira.\"\nProsecutors also detailed other potential evidence they say was found in Tsarnaev's residences, including a Russian dictionary that had handwritten prayer cards tucked into its pages referring to two al Qaeda-linked figures.\nThe government said one of the prayer cards mentioned Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born Muslim cleric who was believed to be a senior propagandist and recruiter for al Qaeda before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011.\nThe other, it said, referred to Tarek Mehanna, a Massachusetts man who was convicted in 2011 of conspiring to materially assist al Qaeda and plotting to kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq.\nThe filing came as a friend of Tsarnaev's admitted in court that he suspected that Tsarnaev was involved in the marathon bombings when he went to Tsarnaev's dorm room a few days after the attack.\nThe man, Dias Kadyrbayev, 20, is accused of removing a laptop and a backpack bearing residue of fireworks after Tsarnaev allegedly sent him a text message asking him to go to the dorm room and \"take what's there.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/boston-bombing-suspect-tsarnaev-expected-die-prosecutors-n121686"}
