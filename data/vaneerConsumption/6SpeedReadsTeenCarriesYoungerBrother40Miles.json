Teen Carries His Brother For 40-Miles\nA pair of Michigan brothers are raising awareness for cerebral palsy in a pretty incredible way. Braden Gandee, 7, has the disease and it prevents him from walking on his own. His 14-year-old brother, Hunter, had been planning for weeks raise awareness for Braden’s illness by participating in a 40-mile walk. Hunter wanted his brother by his side, so he strapped 50-pound Braden to his back and carried him the whole way.\n2. Tracy Morgan Responsive; Truck Driver Faces Charges\nActor and comedian Tracy Morgan is responsive after a deadly accident on the New Jersey Turnpike early Saturday morning, says his spokesman. Morgan is recovering from a broken leg. The actor was with six others when their Mercedes Sprinter limo bus was hit by a Walmart big rig. Morgan’s mentor, fellow comedian James McNair, was killed in the crash. An investigation found that the driver of the truck, 35-year-old Kevin Roper, had not slept for more than 24 hours. He’s expected to appear in court today to face vehicular homicide, assault and reckless driving charges.\n3. Cali Chrome Owner a Sore Loser?\nOver the weekend, racehorse California Chrome came up short on his quest for the Triple Crown. It was a tough feat to begin with; the last winning horse was “Affirmed,” 36 years ago. That’s why so many are scratching their heads as to why Chrome’s owner, Steve Coburn, has been so vocal in his disappointment. He accused rivals of taking “the coward’s way out” by skipping both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, suggesting those horses were more rested than California Chrome. Coburn apologized Monday morning for his earlier comments, but not before receiving considerable criticism from many, including NBC Sports’ Bob Costas.\n4. Psy and Snoop Join Forces\nPsy and Snoop Lion (formally Snoop Dogg) have partnered up for what could possibly be the next “Gangnam Style.” Their new song, entitled “Hangover” is another of Psy’s satires of consumer culture in South Korea. This time, instead of wealth and opulence, the target is alcoholism. Psy and Snoop are seen trouncing about town, consuming incredible amounts of alcohol as their outing gradually escalates into mayhem.\n5. 2014 Tony Awards Are All About Audra\nThe 2014 Tonys are in the history books and so is Audra McDonald’s name. She’s officially the most decorated actress in the event’s history. Her portrayal of Billie Holiday in “Lady at Emerson’s Bar And Grill” earned her a sixth Tony. Clearly moved, the 43-year-old wept during her acceptance speech as she received a standing ovation. She has now won Tonys in all four acting categories.\n6. Doodle 4 Google\nIf you Googled anything today you may have noticed a pretty complex Doodle on the search engine’s home page. It shows waterfalls, wildlife and a pretty cool looking transformative water purifier. The picture (and the purifier) is the brainchild of 11-year-old Audrey Zhang of New York. She’s the winner of the Doodle 4 Google contest. Kids all over the country competed to draw a Google logo depicting something that could help make the world a better place. Along with top prize comes a $30,000 college scholarship and a $50,000 technology grant for her school. In addition, $25,000 was donated in her name to a charity that helps provide clean water to schools in Bangladesh. Well done, Audrey!","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/speed-reads/6-speed-reads-teen-carries-younger-brother-40-miles-n126406"}
