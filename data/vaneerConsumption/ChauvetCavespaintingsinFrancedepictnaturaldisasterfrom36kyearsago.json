drawn 28,000 years before what were previously thought to be the oldest, found in at Catalhoyuk in central Turkey\nA full-size reproduction of Chauvet cave has been built to exactly replicate the underground environment identical to the original that contains the world's oldest known cave paintings (pictured)\nBut closer inspection has now revealed what appears to be the first known depiction of a natural disaster - drawn 28,000 years before what were previously thought to be the oldest, found in at Catalhoyuk in central Turkey.\nThe findings – published on the scientific website PLoS One – could challenge previous ideas about the meaning of cave paintings to the people who made them thousands of years ago.\nPeople from that era had previously drawn hands and animals, but if it is accepted that the pictures depict a volcano, it would suggest that people had a greater understanding of the world they painted than previously thought.\nThe claims are based on a new geological survey that dates an eruption in the nearby Bas-Vivarais region to around the same time as the paintings were done - between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago.\nThe findings – published on the scientific website PLoS One – could challenge previous ideas about the meaning of cave paintings to the people who made them thousands of years ago\nPeople from that era had previously drawn hands and animals, but if these pictures are accepted to depict a volcano, it would suggest that people had a greater understanding of the world they painted than previously though\nThe claims are based on a new geological survey that dates an eruption in the nearby Bas-Vivarais region to around the same time as the paintings were done -
