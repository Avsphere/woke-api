He’s taking on Hillary Clinton, likely the Democratic presidential nominee, for the new revelations coming out of the book Clinton Cash, which exposes information about her foundations foreign donors.\n“As I have traveled around the country, one of the things that has become clear is that the American people are sick of corruption and dishonesty within the government,” said Carson, a likely GOP presidential candidate. “Doublespeak and redefining terms to fit a narrative is truly unacceptable and misleading.”\n“The Clinton Foundation and the appearance of wrongdoing reinforces these feelings,” Carson stated.\nHe added, “It is my strong belief that not only should they definitely give back the money and cease accepting foreign donations, but should also make every effort to find missing documents that would shed light if in fact they are innocent.”\nThe New York Times issued a story in detail about a company in Russia getting roughly 20 percent of American Uranium reserves.\nClinton’s State Department signed off on the deal, and at the same time, individuals connected to the deal also donated to The Clinton Foundation.\nThe Clinton team came out on the defensive.\n“To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government’s review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless,” said spokesperson Brian Fallon.\nCarson said America’s next leader must worry about strengthening the country, not one’s own power.\n“Anyone who contemplates a leadership position in our great nation should thoroughly examine their motives to determine if they are simply interested in enriching themselves and enhancing their own power versus strengthening America and passing it on to the next generation in an improved and ethical condition,” Carson stated.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/04/23/dr-ben-carson-clinton-foundation-should-give-back-the-money-from-foreign-donors/"}
