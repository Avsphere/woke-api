But he went on to win a Golden Globe in 2013 and an Emmy in 2012 for his work in the series\nGansa revealed that 'everyone was very negative' when he suggested Lewis as the lead after being impressed with his performance in The Forsyte Saga, that aired on PBS Masterpiece.\n'The network really wanted Ryan Phillippe; Patrick Wilson passed,' Gansa told the magazine. 'I kept talking about Damian until I got a call from the head of the studio saying, ‘Look, Alex, please do not bring up Damian’s name again.'’\n'Hanging up the phone in my office—I think we were two weeks from the start of principal photography—I was like, Are we going to cast Ryan Phillippe in this role?'\nFirst two choices: Patrick Wilson, left, was offered the role of Brody but passed, according to Homeland showrunner Alex Gansa. The network then wanted Ryan Philippe, right, for the role\nAward-winning: The British actor, 44, starred in three season of the hit drama as the Marine sergeant who returns home to the U.S. after being held hostage in Iraq\nGansa said he finally managed to persuade executives to consider Lewis after getting them to watch the actor's performance in the little-seen film Keane, in which he plays a schizophrenic father searching for his daughter.\n'The first forty-five minutes of the film are essentially Damian on camera. I hit pause and picked up the phone and called the studio head and said, ‘This is just an incredible performance—a damaged person on camera holding the frame,'' he recalled.\nOn the wish list: Gansa told The New Yorker he tapped Lewis for the homeland role after seeing him in the PBS Masterpiece period drama The Forsyte Saga. The actor is pictured with co-star Gina McKee\nConvincing: It was Lewis' performance in the 2004 film Keane that finally won over network execs\nGansa's revelation is part of an article promoting Lewis' newest show Billions, that premieres on Showtimes this week.\nIn the series he plays hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod, who's targeted by the U.S. Attorney General, played by Paul Giamatti.\n'I said yes, because it has the potential to be the show that dovetails in and out of the hard news in the same way that Homeland has been able to do,' Lewis told The New Yorker.\n'And—I hate this phrase—it’s quite heady, being ‘part of the conversation.’'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3394166/Damian-Lewis-choice-role-Nicholas-Brody-Homeland-Patrick-Wilson-passed-Ryan-Phillippe-brief-contender.html"}
