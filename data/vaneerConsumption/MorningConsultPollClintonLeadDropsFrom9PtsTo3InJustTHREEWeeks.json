But the mixed signals from the Trump campaign aren’t winning over immigration advocates.\nClinton has also faced questions about her ties to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of state.\nTrump’s outreach to African American voters appears to be falling flat among that demographic, with only 5 percent of black voters saying they will vote for Trump; 79 percent of African American respondents say they will vote for Clinton, with 16 percent undecided.\nTrump also significantly trails Clinton among women voters — 44 percent to 35 percent — with 21 percent saying they don’t know or have no opinion.\nIndependents remain stubbornly divided in three camps: 35 percent say they will vote for Clinton; 34 percent prefer Trump; and 31 percent are undecided.\nTrump’s gains on Clinton tighten to within the margin of error when accounting for other presidential candidates. In that matchup, Clinton leads Trump by just 2 points, 39 percent to 37 percent.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/08/28/morning-consult-poll-clinton-lead-drops-9-pts-just-3-just-three-weeks/"}
