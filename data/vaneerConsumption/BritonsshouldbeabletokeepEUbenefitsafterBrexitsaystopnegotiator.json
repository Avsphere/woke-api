That means a number of things: the possibility to participate in the European elections, the freedom of travel without problem inside the union…\nEuropean Parliament Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt\n“We need to have an arrangement in which this arrangement can continue for those citizens who on an individual basis are requesting it.”\nMany UK citizens devastated their European identity is being taken away. I will fight for their voices to be heard https://t.co/xdKBPRiWzj — Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) March 10, 2017\nHe claimed to have received more than a thousand letters from UK citizens who do not want to lose their relationship with “European civilisation”.\nUK Prime Minister @number10gov Theresa May held a press conference during European Council #EUCO. Watch here: https://t.co/OtJADTNQcm — UKREP 🇬🇧🇪🇺 (@ukineu) March 9, 2017\nMr Verhofstadt previously said the EU needs to be “open and generous” to individual UK citizens and said politicians were considering how to allow them to maintain their ties to the continent.\nHe told an audience at Chatham House in January: “We are scrutinising, thinking, debating how we could achieve that.\n“That individual UK citizens would think their links with Europe are not broken.”\nConservative MEP Vicky Ford said the UK and EU were not far from agreement on the key Brexit issues of the rights of expatriate citizens and the “divorce bill” of as much as 60 billion euro likely to be demanded from Britain on exit.\nMs Ford told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “On the principles on key issues like citizens’ rights, both sides actually agree, they want to secure citizens’ rights. There is a willingness on both sides to agree the principles on citizens’ rights straight up.\n“Both sides are very close on the money. “The EU are saying they will only ask us to contribute what we’ve committed to and the Prime Minister is saying we don’t walk away from commitments. “If that principle is agreed, then we can move on.”\nMr Verhofstadt warned that the European Parliament could veto any deal struck between the EU and the UK.\n“We vote No – that is possible,” he told Today. “It has happened in a number of other cases that a big international multilateral agreement was voted down by the European Parliament after it was concluded.\n“The fact that in the Treaty it is stated we have to say Yes or No doesn’t mean that automatically we vote Yes.”\nAsked whether the UK Government would welcome the opportunity for British nationals to retain some of the benefits of EU citizenship after Brexit, Theresa May’s official spokesman said: “It’s not something that we have ever proposed or said that we are looking at.\n“We will go into negotiations and discuss the ideas put forward by the EU and its various institutions.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4301350/Britons-able-EU-benefits-Brexit-says-negotiator.html"}
