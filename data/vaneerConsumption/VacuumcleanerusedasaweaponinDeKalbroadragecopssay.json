The man tried to open the passenger side door, according to Parks’ statement in a report released Monday.\n\"Fearing for her safety,” she said she got the vacuum from her trunk. Parks then hit the SUV and, as the man approached her, she struck him with it, the report said.\nA fight ensued with several witnesses trying to pull the man and woman apart.\nOne witness tackled the man because it looked like he was about to hit Parks, the report said. Another witness said the man punched her in the face.\nParks was charged with misdemeanor battery and felony criminal damage to property.\nThe man, who wasn’t arrested, was cited for alleged disorderly conduct.\nHe told police his mother was driving him and his child to Wal-Mart, and he approached Parks’ window to tell her she was driving erratically. Parks said the man’s mother was the one driving poorly.\nThe police department urged patience as Atlanta deals with heavy traffic following last month’s I-85 bridge collapse.\n“Allow law enforcement to deal with the matter in a safe way before a tragic road rage incident occurs,” the agency said in a post on Facebook on Monday.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/vacuum-cleaner-used-weapon-dekalb-road-rage-cops-say/U6HTXXumVcyNwm3aYfvP2L/"}
