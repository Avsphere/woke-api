They will require all but the smallest EU importers of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold to conduct due diligence checks on their suppliers.\nThe new obligations, which still require approval from EU member states, are to take effect in January 2021. The delay is meant to allow EU countries, which will be responsible for ensuring compliance, time to \"appoint competent authorities\" and for importers to become familiar with their obligations.\nRecycled materials and small importers such as dentists and jewelers will be exempted.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4320174/EU-Parliament-approves-tighter-rules-conflict-minerals.html"}
