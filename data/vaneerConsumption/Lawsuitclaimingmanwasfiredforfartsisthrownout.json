Now he suffers with the consequences of its aftermath and called his termination 'embarrassing'.\nRichard Clem, an employee of the food company for ten years, said he only shared an office space with his wife and that he never had to interact with visitors\nHe managed to control the gas with the help of medication, but told the New York Daily News: 'I feel better, but there goes my reputation. Who wants to hire a fart boy?\n'The fact is that I was a loyal and trusted employee for 10 years,' he said.\nRichard said he only shared an office space with his wife and that he never had to interact with visitors.\n'We just opened a window if we wanted to. We used to burn candles all the time,' he said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4320014/Lawsuit-claiming-man-fired-farts-thrown-out.html"}
