That act, first passed in 1988, bans the manufacture of undetectable guns, period. Yet during the renewal of the law, certain Democrats pushed to broaden it, so as to increase the amount of metal that every 3-D printed gun would have to contain.\nThis is where Israel’s proposal will come in.\nHis bill will make allowances for licensed persons and companies to have some freedom to print plastic 3-D guns, but those guns would be required to contain “3.7 ounces of stainless steel.”\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.
