I lost everything back in Venezuela. I had my own natural soup factory but the crisis made it impossible to get ingredients.\n'Things got so bad that I couldn't even find food for my baby. I had little money, but there was nowhere to buy foodâ€¦we would go days without eating. When I tried to breastfeed my daughter, I'd almost faint.'\nThousands of demonstrators have shut down the main highway in Caracas to express their anger with President Nicolas Maduro, who is blamed for Venezuela's economic woes. More than 23 people have been killed during the protests.\nRose traveled to Colombia in a bid to get help and left her daughter with friends.\nBrandon Stanton (pictured) has 25 million followers on Twitter and he steered more than 6,000 of them towards the crowdfunding page\nShe said: 'I'd never said \"goodbye\" to my daughter before. She was screaming my name when I left. It hurt worse than giving birth. But I didn't have a choice.'\nRose said she told her daughter she was going to Colombia to 'make a diamond' and bring it back.\nBut in fact she sells key chains on the streets of the capital, Bogota, and sends packets of food back home when she makes some money.\nShe added: 'I grew up very poor. I came from nothing so I've been here before.'\nLaserna set up a crowd funding page to help her and Stanton shared the link to the page.\nThey had hoped to raise $5,000 but were astonished when generous strangers donated $131,201 to Rose.\nStanton said all the money would go to Rose, enabling her to return home and be with her daughter.\nTwo years ago Stanton helped a 13-year-old boy raise $1.2million for his hard-up school in New York's Brownsville neighborhood.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4448226/Strangers-raise-130-000-Venezuelan-woman.html"}
