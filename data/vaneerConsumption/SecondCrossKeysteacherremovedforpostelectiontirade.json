The first teacher allegedly said in front of others she was glad Trump won because he would get rid of undocumented residents.\nDistrict officials said Friday that “threatening, abusive behavior will not be tolerated in any way and such behavior will be dealt with without delay.”\nAt Cross Keys, 86 percent of the students are Hispanic or Latino. Most of those parents speak English as a second language, if at all. The school was in the news recently after state officials announced last week that the school reported the third-largest graduation rate increase between 2015 and 2016. Principal Jason Heard said then that helping parents learn English was the key that sparked more parental engagement.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/second-cross-keys-teacher-removed-for-post-election-tirade/4vPIS0iWbNLBr8GE1IaeyK/"}
