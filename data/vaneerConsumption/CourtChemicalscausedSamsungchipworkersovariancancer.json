She worked at a Samsung chip factory for six years since 1993 when she was 17.\nThe court said the glues that Lee used to put a silicon wafer on a lead frame contained formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, and phenol, a known promotor of tumors, according to its material safety data sheets.\nThe court also blamed many night shifts and the factory's ventilation system. It ordered a government agency to compensate her family.\nThe court also said the agency should be less stringent in deciding eligibility for compensation when the cause of the disease is not completely clear cut.\nIn South Korea, a government agency levies companies and oversees insurance for workers with occupational diseases.\nBanolim, an advocacy group, says it has details of more than 200 current or former Samsung workers suffering from grave diseases such as leukemia. Of them, 76 have died. Less than a dozen cases had a causal relationship recognized by courts or the government.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422428/Court-Chemicals-caused-Samsung-chip-workers-ovarian-cancer.html"}
