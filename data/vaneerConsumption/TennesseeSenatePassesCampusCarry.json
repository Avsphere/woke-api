The measure allows faculty and staff with concealed carry permits to carry handguns on campus for self-defense.\nSome professors have already staked their opposition to the measure, promising to quit teaching if it becomes legal to carry a gun for self-defense on campuses in Tennessee. But Senator Mike Bell (R-Riceville)–the sponsor of the campus carry legislation–responded to these complaints by saying he hopes the professors do quit and “more conservative instructors will take their place.”\nThe Tennessee House is expected to take up campus carry as early as Wednesday.\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
