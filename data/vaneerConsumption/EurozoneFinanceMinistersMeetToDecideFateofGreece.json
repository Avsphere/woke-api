Without them, it faces bankruptcy and a potential exit from the euro.\nBut the release of those loans depends on Greece meeting the terms of its 2015 bailout agreement. There are disagreements on those terms, notably on how tough Greece’s budget targets should be.\nAt Monday’s meeting, Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos will try to convince his peers that bailout inspectors should return to Athens to conclude the latest assessment, which would allow the release of bailout funds.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/02/20/eurozone-finance-ministers-meet-discuss-fate-greece/"}
