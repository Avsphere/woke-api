Individuals would have to pay 10 million rupees ($66,000)for an elephant, although temples would get them for free.\nBut Asian elephant expert Jayantha Jayewardene said the decision was \"ill thought out and totally irresponsible\" and accused the government of selling animals to raise revenue.\nHe said the move could jeopardise baby elephants that were taken to Pinnawala after they were seized from wealthy Sri Lankans accused of keeping them illegally.\nCapturing wild elephants is illegal in Sri Lanka but there have been cases of young animals being taken from their parents to be sold on the black market.\n\"We are very surprised by the decision to give back these elephants,\" Jayewardene told AFP. \"It is a sad day for conservation.\"\nThere has also been controversy over the separation of elephant calves whose parents are still alive.\nEarlier this month a group of wildlife enthusiasts went to court to stop an elephant calf, which was given to New Zealand during a visit by the then-prime minister John Key, from being taken away from its mother.\nBuddhist monk Malope Sobitha said six-year-old Nandi should not be separated from her parents, who were both still living at Pinnawala.\nLast year Sri Lanka unveiled tougher laws, including a ban on using young elephants for logging and other physical work, as part of a crackdown on cruelty to animals.\nOfficial records show there are about 200 domesticated elephants in Sri Lanka. The population in the wild is estimated at about 7,500.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4447406/Sri-Lanka-overturns-ban-adopting-elephants.html"}
