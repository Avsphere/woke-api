They also generate power for the systems on board.\nA Royal Navy source said the most likely action will be to add as many as two extra generators to each ship to \"bolster the power that's already there\".\nThe source accepted that carrying out such maintenance just a few years in to the ships' service was not \"normal\".\nHe said: \"It is an issue, we're managing it at the moment but we need to do something about it.\"\nThe MoD has not disclosed the cost of the work but it is thought that it could run to tens of millions of pounds.\nCutting in to the side is a normal way to access the engine rooms in the bottom of the ship, the source added.\n\"It's perfectly normal practice for maritime maintenance,\" he said.\nAn MoD spokesman said: \" The Type 45 destroyers are hugely capable ships and have consistently made a difference to our safety and security.\n\"In our defence review last year we committed to improving the Type 45's power and propulsion system through a series of machinery upgrades during planned maintenance, which will ensure increased availability and resilience over the life of the ships.\"\nBAE Systems, which builds the ships, said it is \"working collaboratively with the MoD and industry partners to deliver improvements to the power generation capability of the Type 45 destroyers\" .\nRolls-Royce, which makes the WR-21 gas turbines, said they will continue to work with the MoD \"on upgrading the performance of the propulsion system\", and Wartsila, which makes the diesel generators, said it is \"co-operating with the Royal Navy and we are fully committed to support the customer in operating the engines efficiently\".\nThe destroyers are used in \"hunting pirates, drug runners or submarines, defending the fleet from air attack, and providing humanitarian aid after natural disasters\", the MoD said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3422339/Royal-Navy-destroyers-new-engines-breakdowns.html"}
