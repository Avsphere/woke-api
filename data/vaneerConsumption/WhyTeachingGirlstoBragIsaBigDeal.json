The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nBeginning at an early age, many young women are taught not to boast and brag. Now there’s a program to teach girls to do just the opposite — it wants girls and young women to trumpet their successes with their words and actions.\n“We hear that it's impolite, that nice girls don't do it,” said career coach Peggy Klaus. “What women do is that we put our heads down, we do really good work.”\n“And yet when it comes to us, we don't talk about ourselves in a positive way,” she added.\nThe Young Women’s Leadership School is a network of competitive inner-city public schools, which, along with Klaus, is working toward improving girls’ confidence.\nThey offer guidance on body language, storytelling and how to boost enthusiasm.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/why-teaching-girls-brag-big-deal-n96811"}
