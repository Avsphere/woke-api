The defense argued that Lopez-Sanchez found the gun wrapped in a t-shirt. He picked it up and it went off.\nProsecutor Diane Garcia countered this by suggesting that even if that were the case, Lopez-Sanchez “could have fired the gun anywhere, but he fired at Kate Steinle.” She accused him of “[playing] his own version of Russian roulette” with Steinle’s life.\nGonzalez responded by blaming the gun, a .40 caliber Sig Sauer that had been stolen from a federal agent who works for the Bureau of Land Management. He says the gun “has no safety” and claims “there is no evidence that [Lopez-Sanchez] put his finger in the trigger.”\nIt is interesting to note that Lopez-Sanchez reportedly told police at one point “that he was shooting at a seal or a black fish.” He would need to put his finger on the trigger and pull it to do that.\nGonzalez does not deny that Lopez-Sanchez shared this explanation with police. Rather, he suggests Lopez-Sanchez only did so as part of an “awkward effort by Lopez-Sanchez to explain the accidental shooting.”\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
