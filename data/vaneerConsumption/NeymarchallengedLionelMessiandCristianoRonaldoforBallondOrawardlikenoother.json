He played Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at their own game and held his own.\nSince Fernando Torres seven years ago, at his lethal peak with Liverpool, no other forward has reached the Ballon d'Or top three.\nBayern Munich's Franck Ribery was as close as it got but the others put up alongside the sparring Argentine and Portuguese had different skill-sets. Manuel Neuer, Andres Iniesta, Xavi, artists in their own way but merely the sideshow to Messi and Ronaldo's long-running bout.\nNeymar has proved in 2015 that he belongs in the company of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo\nA nod to the mortals, while the gods wage war with each other.\nRonaldo won the award for the first time in 2008, with Messi second, and since then the pair have refused to relinquish it. Messi won it four times in a row, Ronaldo twice more after that.\nBut Neymar will stand on the stage in Zurich and know, however the vote goes, he has joined the stars. In the Champions League last season the three finished on 10 goals each, with Barcelona lifting the trophy, one of five won in 2015.\nNeymar scored these goals at high-pressure moments in the tournament, in both quarter-finals, both semis and sealing Barcelona’s triumph in Berlin with the third against Juventus in the final.\nThe Brazilian has played at a consistently high standard and scored 41 goals for the Catalans in 2015\nWith his tricks and flicks, Neymar has the flair that his fellow Brazilian Ronaldinho graced the Nou Camp with\nWhile his overall weight as a player in the pantheon of football greats will be determined over the next decade, rather than in a single season, Neymar can shatter the hegemony between the two reference points of world football.\nNeymar played at a consistently high standard through 2015 and even if he must defer to Messi at club level thanks to the Argentine's history, his performances offer something that even his team-mate cannot muster.\nThe Brazilian has the flair that Ronaldinho carried the banner for at the Nou Camp, the magic touch which can make the crowd gasp, screech and rise to their feet to applaud. He can be the first player outside of the usual suspects to win it since his compatriot Kaka, in 2007.\nCaptain of his country, he is the gleaming tower in an otherwise miserable footballing landscape in his homeland, and Dani Alves says he has ‘the fantasy factor’ of the great Brazil players. His only fault this year was getting sent off in the Copa America with Brazil eliminated early, though Messi could not drive his country to victory either.\nNeymar’s goal against Villarreal in November illustrated him at his best.\nAlong with Luis Suarez (left) and Messi (right), Neymar has formed a formidable front three\nReceiving the ball on the halfway line he nodded it to Luis Suarez, before bursting forward with electric pace. Suarez crossed it back to Neymar, now on the edge of the box. That’s when the magic happened. One touch to control it on his chest, another to flick it over his own head and confound the defender, and a third to lash it past keeper Alphonse Areola on the volley.\nNo player should win the Ballon d’Or for one great goal but this effort was merely the logical conclusion of where Neymar’s work was headed. More will follow. Every detail of his game is laced with beauty.\nEven a long ball dropping out of the sky will be controlled by one foot flicking out behind the other leg, a show of technical brilliance. Some contest the value of it. But when defenders see Neymar show off like that, it strikes fear into them. How can they have the slightest idea about what he is about to try when even controlling the ball is done in such an unorthodox way?\nThe Brazilian, pictured scoring against Bayern Munich, was prolific in Barca's Champions League campaign\nNeymar (right) with Suarez (left) and Messi after winning the Champions League in Berlin in June\nThere is nobody better in world football at beating a man one-on-one than Neymar. And the proof is in his battered, bruised shins. Defenders cannot handle Neymar, so they kick him. They kick Messi and Ronaldo too, but pound for pound, the Brazilian takes more hits than anyone else. His flicks and tricks aggravate and distract, but while in previous seasons he has been inconsistent, now he has end product. He has it in spades.\nNeymar scored 41 goals for Barcelona in 2015, of a record total of 180 in all competitions, just seven fewer than Messi, who was enjoying one of the best seasons of his career too. This season he is top of La Liga's scoring chart, joint with Suarez on 15 goals. Neymar also leads the assist tally, joint with three other players on seven.\nPerhaps most impressively, when Messi missed two months injured, Neymar took the reins and became Barcelona’s strongest creative influence. He and Suarez scored all of Barcelona’s league gaols, until Messi finally returned in El Clasico.\nAlmost symbolically by the time he came on as a substitute the game was won, with Neymar destroying Danilo time after time to help Barcelona penetrate Los Blancos. They won 4-0, a humiliating defeat which now-sacked Real coach Rafa Benitez never recovered from.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3393488/Neymar-challenged-Lionel-Messi-Cristiano-Ronaldo-Ballon-d-like-no-forward-wins-not-Brazilian-belongs-company.html"}
