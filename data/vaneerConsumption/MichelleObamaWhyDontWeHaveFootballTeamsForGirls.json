But when mothers did the same, she was accused for neglecting their children.\n“Often, when men are assertive or argumentative at work, they’re viewed as strong and powerful,” she said. “But women who act that way aren’t always viewed so positively.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/06/30/michelle-obama-lets-football-teams-girls/"}
