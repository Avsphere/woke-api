And on that Hillary Clinton is doing poorly.”\nHost Wolf Blitzer said, “We have numbers of that—in Florida, 51 percent say Hillary Clinton is not honest and trustworthy. In Ohio, another key battleground state, 53 percent, and in Pennsylvania, 54 percent don’t view her as honest and trustworthy. You look at those numbers and you have to worry if you’re a supporter of Hillary Clinton.”\nBash added, “The problem for her is that unlike these other candidates, she’s a known quantity. So they know her and don’t trust her.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/06/17/cnns-bash-hillarys-problem-is-voters-know-her-and-dont-trust-her/"}
