It means Mrs May is now authorised to launched the Article 50 process\nBut Mr Davis has played down concerns about quitting the EU without a deal, saying it was 'not as frightening as some people think'.\nAppearing before a committee of MPs, Mr Davis played down the suggestion by Remain MPs that it would be a catastrophe.\nHe said the Government had not conducted a formal economic assessment of the consequences of leaving without a deal. That sparked accusations that ministers were 'driving towards a cliff-edge with a blindfold on'.\nMr Davis said it might be a year before he could offer any figures on what 'no deal' would mean. He added: 'It's not as frightening as some people think, but it's not as simple as some people think.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319358/History-Queen-gives-Royal-Assent-Brexit-Bill.html"}
