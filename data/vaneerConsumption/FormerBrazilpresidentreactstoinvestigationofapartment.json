Silva has said his wife had an option to buy the apartment in the coastal city of Guaruja but they never purchased it.\nOn Wednesday, prosecutors said they were investigating whether money diverted from the Petrobras scheme was laundered through illegal real-estate transactions.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421530/Former-Brazil-president-reacts-investigation-apartment.html"}
