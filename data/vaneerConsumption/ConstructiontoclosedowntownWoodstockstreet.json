Wall Street runs behind the Johnston Building, bounded by Wall, Mill and Main streets. Belcher is replacing the small commercial structure with a new one.\nStaff said it evaluated Belcher’s request and concluded “closure is the only way to truly secure the construction site, expedite construction, consolidate operations and protect public safety due to the complexities and challenging logistics” in the limited space available.\nPedestrian access will be maintained with the sidewalk bordering the city parking lot west of Wall, as well as along Main, staff said. “Staff will be in close communication with the contractor through the course of the closure and the delivery of the project.”","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/construction-close-downtown-woodstock-street/Shi4D5Bq1CRK37BzrWVWUJ/"}
