A flood watch will also be in effect Tuesday morning through Wednesday evening for areas north of I-20 — including north Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett and Cobb counties.\nThe roughly two inches of rain expected means a chance of creeks and small rivers flooding.\nBut Thursday and Friday should be partly sunny and rain free, Minton said.\nAfternoon highs will be in the low 70s Monday and mid-70s Tuesday before falling back into the low 60s on Wednesday. Highs will only reach the mid-50s Thursday and Friday, according to Minton.\nMorning lows will be in the mid-50s Tuesday and Wednesday and low 40s Thursday and Friday, she said.\nNormal high for the end of November is 58 degrees, and the normal low is 40.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/weather/flood-watch-for-much-metro-atlanta-begins-tuesday-morning/mHFXgWs5cYvqNQTcJByz4H/"}
