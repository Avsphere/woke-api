An earlier attempt to buy the remaining shares was scuttled by the 2011 phone-hacking scandal that rocked Murdoch's British newspapers.\nThe takeover values Sky, which broadcasts Premier League soccer and top film and television offerings, at 18.5 billion pounds ($22.7 billion).","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319998/UK-regulators-examine-Murdoch-media-deal.html"}
