His killer? An illegal immigrant gang member who just got out of prison,” says the narrator. “Jas’s dad, Jamiel, is supporting Donald Trump for president because he knows he will end illegal immigration.”\nShaw’s dad delivers the emotional pitch to African-Americans, who comprise a large proportion of South Carolina, where the GOP’s next primaries will be held Feb. 20. “Trump is the only one saying, ‘You going to be dealt with, we’re going to enforce that… We’re going to enforce that,'” the father says in the video. “That’s a beautiful thing,” he adds.\n“I believe Donald Trump wants to make us great again, and he loves America,” the father says.\nAfrican-Americans have been hit hard by large-scale legal and illegal immigration since 2000. Their wages and their accumulated wealth, plus their collective political power, have been hammered as one million legal migrants enter the country each year to join the resident population of roughly 11 million illegal migrants.\nIn 2013, for example, President Barack Obama chose to add roughly two million foreign workers to the economy, just as four million 18-year-old Americans — including roughly 650,000 young African-Americans — began looking for jobs. Many polls show that Americans overwhelmingly oppose the award of jobs to foreigners before Americans find jobs.\nIn an early-February statement to Breitbart News, Trump’s campaign also said he would push for a reduction in legal immigration.\nI will support legislation to reduce the numbers, and will oppose legislation to increase the numbers. I have laid out a detailed plan to accomplish this goal on my website www.DonaldJTrump.com. My suggested reforms include a requirement to give all open jobs to Americans first — instead of importing foreign replacements. This plan will appeal to voters from all walks of life by making it easier for workers in this country to find jobs and support their families. It will also help minority workers, youth, and previous immigrants who face intense job competition from waves of incoming foreign workers.\nView the ad here.\nAccording to the Feb. 12 press statement released by the campaign:\nMr. Trump says, ‘People wouldn’t be talking about illegal immigration had I not brought it up when I announced I was running for President. It is a massive problem in our country and now everybody agrees with me — bad for crime and the economy. A wonderful young man, Jamiel Shaw Jr., whose father has become a friend of mine, was shot in the face for no reason by an illegal immigrant. He was getting ready to go to college on a football scholarship and his sole fault was walking home to see his father. Because of the relationship I have established with his father, Jamiel’s death is very personal to me. We must stop illegal immigration.’ Jamiel Shaw added, ‘Donald Trump is the only person fighting to put American families first. He will protect our children and put an end to these senseless acts of violence that are caused by our failed policies and broken immigration system. Donald Trump has made it clear he, like most Americans, want to return the rule of law to the people of this country. Without strong borders we don’t have a country. Strong border enforcement is the first step to preventing future tragedies. We must secure our borders and return those who came here illegally to their native lands. Donald Trump is a man who stands for what is right. He stands for America and I stand with him.’\nThe South Carolina primary will be held Feb. 20.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/02/12/3022731/"}
