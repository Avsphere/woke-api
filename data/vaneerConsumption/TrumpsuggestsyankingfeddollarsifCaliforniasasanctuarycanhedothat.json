This year, with hundreds of millions of dollars rolling into initiative campaigns over housing and health care, California has hit a new record.\nThe $111 million campaign against Proposition 8 on kidney dialysis clinics amounts to the most money poured into a single side of a ballot measure in the United States—at least since electronic record-keeping began in 2002, and possibly ever.\nHere are three industries spending huge sums to influence your vote:\nLandlords and real estate agents outraising rent-control advocates 3-to-1\nLandlords are largely bankrolling the campaign against Proposition 10, which would allow local governments to expand rent control.\n“They don’t want to see their property values decline, it’s that simple,” said Steve Maviglio, spokesman for the No on Prop. 10 campaign, which has raised $74.7 million.\nProp. 10 would repeal a 1995 state law that forbids cities from applying rent control to single-family houses, or any type of home built after 1995, and allows landlords to raise apartment rent any time a tenant moves out. Instead the ballot measure would give cities the option to expand rent control to cover more homes—making it harder for landlords to turn a profit.\n“It’s about their future, their bottom line. That’s why they’re spending so much,” said Charly Norton, spokeswoman for the Yes on prop. 10 campaign, which has raised $25.9 million, mostly from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\nSupporters say Prop. 10 is necessary because homelessness is on the rise and a growing share of Californians spend more than half their income on rent. Opponents say it will worsen the state’s housing shortage by discouraging developers from building more homes.\nDonors against Prop. 10 include corporate property owners like Blackstone, Essex and Equity Residential, as well as many individual landlords. The biggest donor is the California Association of Realtors, which has given $8 million to the campaign.\nThe Realtors association also has poured $13.2 million into the campaign for Proposition 5, making it the sole funder of that push to change California’s property tax law.\nCalifornians now generally pay much higher property taxes if they buy a new home after selling a house they’ve owned for many years. That’s because property taxes are based on the sales price of a house, not how much it’s worth as it appreciates over time.\nThis initiative would allow three categories of homeowners—those over 55, disabled or who lost their homes in natural disasters—would keep the property tax levels of the home they sold if they buy a new home.\nReal estate agents say it would encourage older Californians to sell their homes, making more houses available in our tight market. (Experts disagree.) Of course, it also would boost their commissions.\n“It will give a huge windfall to the real estate industry,” said Mike Roth, spokesman for the campaign against Prop. 5, which has raised about $3.2 million, largely from public employee unions that could see cuts if the government loses tax revenue.\nSteve White, president of the California Association of Realtors, insisted it’s about “meeting a need. The unaffordability of housing in California…is largely dictated by lack of availability,” he said. “We have tens of thousands of homes that could be waiting for all those tens of thousands of younger families.”\nDialysis clinics outraising labor opponents 5-to-1\nThe most expensive fight on the California ballot this year is over Proposition 8, which would limit profits for dialysis companies. The businesses are fighting back, pouring $111 million into the campaign against Prop. 8—most of it from two dialysis companies, DaVita and Fresenius.\n“Prop. 8 was designed to have a negative impact on dialysis clinics in California, and that’s why the groups that are opposed are fighting it so heavily,” said Kathy Fairbanks, spokeswoman for the No Prop. 8 campaign.\nShe said the measure wouldn’t allow dialysis clinics to be reimbursed by insurance companies for many routine business expenses. Ultimately, that would cause companies to close clinics, Fairbanks said, giving patients fewer places to seek treatment.\nWorkers at dialysis clinics are not unionized. A labor group that represents other health care workers has had its sights on organizing dialysis workers, and put Prop. 8 on the ballot as part of a much larger feud within the industry.\n“This record amount of (campaign) spending speaks to the priorities of the dialysis corporations which is to protect their profits,” said Sean Wherley, spokesman Service Employees International Union – United Healthcare Workers, the sponsor of Prop. 8.\nThe Prop. 8 campaign has raised $20.3 million, most of it from SEIU United Healthcare Workers. The union argues that dialysis clinic companies are netting huge profits while allowing shoddy health and safety conditions at some clinics. Limiting the companies’ profits to 15 percent, as Prop. 8 calls for, would encourage the clinics to put more money into improving patient care, the union argues.\nAmbulance companies outraising labor opponents more than 600-to-1\nColorado-based company American Medical Response put Proposition 11 on the ballot and contributed most of the $29.9 million raised to support it. The measure would allow private ambulance companies to require workers to remain on-call during breaks, so they can respond to an emergency even if it comes while they’re eating lunch. That’s already the common practice, but this measure comes in response to a court ruling that security guards cannot be required to stay on-call while they’re on breaks. Ambulance companies don’t want to be held to the same standard.\n“If applied to the ambulance industry, it would have a significant public safety risk,” said Marie Brichetto, spokeswoman for the Yes on Prop. 11 campaign.\nOpponents, the emergency responders who work on ambulances, aren’t raising much money—the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees union contributed just $47,000 to oppose Prop. 11.\n“This is a classic ‘big corporation against its own employees,’” said Jason Brollini, president of the United EMS Workers union that is affiliated with AFSCME.\nHe contends the ambulance companies’ real motive with Prop. 11 is to eliminate any liability they could face from employees who sue over not getting the extra pay they’re supposed to receive when their breaks are interrupted by an emergency call.","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/trump_california/29187/"}
t defense against the executive order may be “state’s rights”\nSan Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera insists that his city’s policies do not violate Section 1373. But even if they did, he argues in a complaint submitted to the U.S. District Court, section 1373 is “unconstitutional on its face.”\nBecause the law dictates how local and state employees can or cannot communicate with ICE, the city contends that it constitutes the commandeering of state and local officers by the federal government, and therefore violates the 10th Amendment of the Constitution.\nLegal wonks may note the irony here. The 10th Amendment provides that “powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States” and is the foundation of many “states’ rights” arguments typically favored by small-government conservatives. Call this San Francisco’s “Born Again Federalist” moment.\nCalifornians split on support for sanctuary status\nIn fact, according to some legal scholars, San Francisco’s best line of defense might come from a 1997 Supreme Court case over the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which would have required local police and sheriffs to perform background checks on prospective gun buyers. The Court struck that provision down on 10th Amendment grounds.\nThe majority opinion, written by the late Justice and titan of conservative jurisprudence Antonin Scalia, held that the federal government simply cannot “command the States’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program”\nAccording to Deep Gulasekaram, a professor of constitutional and immigration law at Santa Clara University, that argument looks an awful lot like the question over sanctuary cities.\n“If you apply that same logic there, Congress cannot force local law enforcement officers to participate in immigration enforcement,” he says. “They simply can’t.”\nStill, this won’t be the first time that Section 1373 sees its day in court. In 1999, New York City saw its own policy, which banned city employees from passing information about undocumented immigrants to federal immigration authorities, struck down by a federal court as a violation of the statute.\nSan Francisco is now hoping that a court will either view the city’s own sanctuary policy as narrower than New York’s blanket ban on communication—or better yet, that the New York ruling will simply be overturned.\n5. If Trump tries to strip sanctuaries of federal funding, it won’t be that easy\nCalifornia’s Legislative Analyst’s Office recently estimated that California receives roughly $368 billion from the federal government every year. That includes $79 billion in direct spending to the state, $8.2 billion in local and county funding, and $281 billion to California-based individuals, non-profits, businesses, and universities. (It might be worth noting that this is still substantially less than the $405 billion that the federal government collects from California, but so far, no California lawmakers are threatening to cut off D.C. in retaliation and, even if they did, it isn’t clear how the state would go about doing that).\nNow that the Trump administration has threatened to pull federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions, how much of this money is actually on the line?\nWhere do California’s federal dollars go?\nCourts have traditionally limited the degree to which the federal government can use funding as a cudgel against uncooperative state and local governments.\nFirst, most legal scholars agree that the money at stake generally has to relate in some way to the law or action that the federal government wants the city or state to take. For example, in 2016, California received a total of $132 million in grant money from the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs. While the Trump administration might be able to pull those funds in response to the state’s sanctuary policies without too much legal trouble, cutting off the entire $368 billion tap might not pass constitutional muster.\nLikewise, courts have generally held that conditions on federal grants have to be spelled out to recipients ahead of time. This prevents the federal government from luring a city or state into taking federal funding only to use those dollars as ransom to extract desired policy changes.\nLastly, and maybe most challenging for the Trump administration’s de-funding efforts, courts have ruled that federal funding options can’t be so coercive that they pass the point where “pressure turns into compulsion” and they deprive local or state governments of any real choice about policy decisions.\nFor example, the federal government makes a small fraction of highway funding contingent on each state maintaining a legal drinking age of 21. The Supreme Court has held that this restriction wasn’t unduly coercive because of the relatively small stakes involved. But what about a threat to take away all federal funding?\nThrough his executive orders and in other ways, President Trump is likely to test the limits of these precedents. After a recent protest turned violent at UC Berkeley, he took to Twitter, asking whether the university couldn’t also be deprived of federal funding.\n“I don’t have a crystal ball, so maybe a court looking at this would end up changing the way we understand these conditions,” says Santa Clara’s Gulasekaram. “But the fact is, that’s not how constitutional law works.”","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/trump-suggests-yanking-fed-dollars-if-california-is-a-sanctuary-statecan-he-do-that/"}
