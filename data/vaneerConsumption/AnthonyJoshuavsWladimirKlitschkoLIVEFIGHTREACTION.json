He rose but the 14-years younger man who had looked exhausted for some time took an energy charge from that success and dropped him again with vicious left hook.\nRead Jeff Powell's full report here.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-4458728/Anthony-Joshua-v-Wladimir-Klitschko-fight-LIVE-BOXING.html"}
