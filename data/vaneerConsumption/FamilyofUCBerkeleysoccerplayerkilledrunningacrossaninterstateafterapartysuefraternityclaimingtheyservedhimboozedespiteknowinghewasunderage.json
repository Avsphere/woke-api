The economics major and soccer star at the prestigious school had then lost contact.\nReports said he was likely drunk at the time. His cousin Logan Crespan told DailyMail.com: 'He said he was going to the beach when he left the party but the closest beach was 15 miles away.'\nHis family believe members of the frat (pictured) let him in without an ID and served him booze even though they knew he was underage\nVasquez, born in Novato, California, was an accomplished soccer player who trained at France's esteemed Racing Club Strasbourg Alsace and the youth academy of Pachuca in Mexico\nVasquez's mother, Wendy Margolin, said that at around 2.20am her son had called a friend, Aurora, Cardenas, and told her he was 'screwed' and did not know where he was.\n'He pretty much said, \"I need you to come over here, I need help.' I asked him, 'Where are you?' and he told me that he was in LA and that he didn't know where he was at and that he was lost,\" Cardenas told NBC Bay Area.\n'The second time he called it just clicked. I didn't know if his phone died, or if he hung up.'\nVasquez was not a member of a fraternity.\nAt the time Cal Athletics released a statement saying: 'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,' the press release said. 'Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloiâ€™s safety and our first priority is to help in any way we can to locate him.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423171/Family-UC-Berkeley-soccer-player-killed-running-interstate-party-sue-fraternity-claiming-served-booze-despite-knowing-underage.html"}
