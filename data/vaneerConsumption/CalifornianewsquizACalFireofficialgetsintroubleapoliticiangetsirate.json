In documents released to CALmatters, Padilla wrote to Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon about the incident, which detailed how Chau “spoke to the staff in a highly aggressive and demeaning tone, at times leaning over the counter and raising his hands at staff while berating them.” In a response letter, Rendon told Padilla he had talked to Chau and that it would not happen again. Chau told CALmatters the incident was a “miscommunication or misunderstanding.”","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/california-news-quiz-july-27/"}
