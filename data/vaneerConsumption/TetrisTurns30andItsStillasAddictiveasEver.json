The game is as big as it ever was, and amazingly, has hardly changed a bit over 30 years and dozens of titles. A few new features have made it both more complex and forgiving, but the developers haven't added any new blocks.\nFeeling the need to play right now? The official Tetris site has links to a number of free versions — if you don't already have one installed.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/tetris-turns-30-its-still-addictive-ever-n124871"}
