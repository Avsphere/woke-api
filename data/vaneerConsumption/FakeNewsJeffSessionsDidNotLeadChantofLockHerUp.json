Politico, in the same vein, reported — as news — that the incident was “the latest example of President Donald Trump and his aides making aggressive gestures toward their political rivals” and that it “follows other moves by Trump and his aides that have alarmed not only Trump critics but other fellow Republicans.”\nIn fact, all Sessions did was laugh — once he recognized the chant — and comment that it had been heard on the campaign trail. As Breitbart News reported, and as video confirms: “Sessions laughed as the chants grew louder and replied, “‘Lock her up,’ I heard that a long time over the last campaign.”\nThat did not stop the media from pretending that Sessions’s response was somehow significant — and marked a further sign of descent into authoritarian rule:\nJUST IN: Attorney General Jeff Sessions laughs and repeats “Lock her up” as audience at a high school leadership summit here in DC begins chanting those words. — Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) July 24, 2018\nThe attorney general of the united states just joined a chant of “lock her up” at an event in DC. — Dafna Linzer (@DafnaLinzer) July 24, 2018\nJeff Sessions just led a chant of “lock her up” at a high school leadership summit.
