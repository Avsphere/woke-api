On August 19 Nicolas Hanauer is listed as giving $1 million as well. These million-dollar contributions are on top of the hundreds of thousands that one-percenters had contributed to Initiative 594 by August 17.\nFor example, Breitbart News reported Steve and Connie Ballmer gave $580,000 prior to August 17, and Hanauer had already given hundreds of thousands too. The AP reports that Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen gave “$500,000 earlier this month.”\nGun-rights supporters are pushing Initiative 591 to counter 594.\n591 would prevent “Washington state from adopting background-check laws that go beyond the national standard.”\nLacking the support of one-percenters, Initiative 591 has received just over $1 million in total donations.\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.
