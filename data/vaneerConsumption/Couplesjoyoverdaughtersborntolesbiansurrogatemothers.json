She says she then suffered “repeated losses” after that.\nPete Akoun, Tricia Hunt, Kate Fruin-Smith and Tracy Akoun\nShe added: “I saw a programme on This Morning about surrogacy and Pete went away and researched it and asked how I felt about it.”\nThe couple created a profile on a surrogacy website but were duped by a conwoman into handing over £400.\nThey were overjoyed to meet Ms Fruin-Smith, but she suggested she only wanted to carry one baby. The couple wanted two children and so approached Mrs Hunt, who was willing to carry a second child.\nBoth women fell pregnant – using syringes and a Mooncup to carry the sperm – in Autumn 2015.\nMrs Akoun, an assistant manager in a care home, said: “We were absolutely ecstatic. I don’t think Pete took it on board at all. I think he was worried that something might go wrong. At the end of the day, you worry until that baby is in your arms. We took each day at a time.”\nNyobi (left) and Kenya, daughters of Tracy and Pete Akoun, who were born a month apart to two different lesbian surrogate mothers\nNyobi was born to Mrs Hunt two weeks early on June 4, 2016, at St Richard’s Hospital in Chichester. Kenya was born to Ms Fruin-Smith a month later, on July 4, at Rotherham General Hospital in South Yorkshire.\nUnder UK law, the surrogate is the child’s legal parent until the intended parents are granted a parental order six weeks after the birth.\nMrs Akoun said she never “thought for one minute” that either woman would not be able to give up the baby: “The relationship is like family and we’re still in touch – we visit each other.\n“Tricia only lives 20 minutes away, they come around for dinner and we go round to theirs every three or four months. I don’t have any jealousy or insecurity when they’re here. To both girls, I am their mum.”\nNyobi and Kenya at home in Portsmouth\nMr Akoun, 26, who came to the UK from Nigeria in 2009, has also never doubted that the babies would be handed over.\nThe full-time dad said: “Nyobi is now nine months and Kenya is eight months. When the time is right, we’ll tell them about how they were conceived.”\nMrs Akoun, who has an 18-year-old daughter, Breunne, from a previous relationship, said: “All you ever hear is the negative side of surrogacy. But for every negative story there are 40 or 50 positive ones. They are your children from the word go.”\nMrs Hunt, 36, a dog groomer from Chichester, has two sons, Joe, 13, and Bradley, six, from a previous heterosexual relationship. She also has twin girls, Katie and Jessica, aged two, from her marriage to partner Cathy, 31. Cathy conceived the girls using donor sperm.\nMrs Hunt said: “We’d had help to conceive the girls and we thought we’d try and help somebody else out – it was our way of giving back.”\nTracy and Pete Akoun, with their daughters\nMrs Hunt said there is “always an affection” for the surrogate baby and she would often chat to Nyobi while pregnant.\n“But when you meet the intended mother and get to know the couple you’re going to work with, you get involved in their emotion,” she said.\n“I remember at the 20-week scan that Pete cried. It’s almost like a drug. I couldn’t wait for them to hold their baby.”\nMs Fruin-Smith, 37, from Rotherham, is in a civil partnership with Rebecca, 28, a stay-at-home mother.\nShe works in a children’s nursery and has four children from a previous heterosexual relationship; Daniel, 16, Heather, 15, Zoe, 11, and Thomas, nine. She also has Lily, aged three, with Rebecca, who was conceived with donor sperm.\nKate Fruin-Smith\nShe said: “When I met Rebecca, we started looking into sperm donation. We decided that if we were going to accept help, we could help others. I spent about four or five years to think about it and look into the legalities of it all.”\nMs Fruin-Smith gave birth to a girl, now aged three, for another couple before agreeing to carry for Mr and Mrs Akoun.\nShe said: “The child was conceived to never be my baby – all through the pregnancy it was their child. Tracy is a very emotional person so it was amazing to see her light up at the scans.\n“It’s so rewarding to know you can make that much difference in somebody’s life.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4300320/Couple-s-joy-daughters-born-lesbian-surrogate-mothers.html"}
