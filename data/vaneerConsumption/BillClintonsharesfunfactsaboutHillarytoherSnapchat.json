The potential jokes from this post are endless'.\nScroll down for video\nTeaming up: Bill took over Hillary's Snapchat account on Friday in a move that prompted much hilarity online\nFun facts: While on the way to Muscatine, Bill shared some fun facts about his wife. He said that she loves hot peppers and is a huge Chicago Cubs baseball fan.\nAnd Kodi Gaddis was slightly more direct adding: 'I bet he sends d*** pics'.\nThe SnapChat stunt comes as Hillary's once substantial lead in the polls continues to hemorrhage and the pressure mounts ahead of Monday's all-important Iowa caucus.\nA Quinnipiac University survey on Wednesday put Clinton in a dead heat with Bernie Sanders in Iowa with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley in a distant third to win support for the Democratic candidacy.\nHillary has increasingly used Bill on the campaign trail as the pressure mounts.\nSignature please: Bill signed a man's shirt during one event Friday for his wife. He also shared a snap of himself carpooling to his next stop, Davenport, Iowa\nCatching up: Before taking the stage in Davenport, Bill had the chance to catch up with his wife. The couple also shared a touching moment when they hugged each other back stage\nWhile recording videos on the social media app, Bill gave three fun facts about his wife. He shared that she loves hot peppers and is a fan of the Chicago Cubs and thinks they'll win the World Series in her lifetime.\nThe couple took to the stage together in a show of family unity while in Iowa Friday for a campaign event.\nOnce Hillary announced that he would take over her Snapchat for the day, hundreds of users shared their thoughts - both positive and negative - on Twitter.\nThe mocking tweets followed her initial post well into Friday afternoon.\n@Rubberlon commented: 'It's Friday. Hill handed her snatch-chat account over to Bill. Allows time for R and R!!'\nAnother user crudely added: 'He's gonna snapchat lots of v**'.\nThe former president is also known for his love for the saxophone and took a snap with a girl who had hers on hand. He also poised for several photos with Hillary supporters throughout the day at events\nOf course, Bill wasn't using the service to send pictures but instead took over the account to document 24 hours on the campaign trail using the app's popular My Story function.\nIn the introductory video, the couple were seen giggling as Hillary handed over her smartphone: 'Here it is. You're going to be in charge of my Snapchat today have fun,' she tells her husband.\nAnd the former President had already filmed himself stopping off at various campaign events by the early afternoon.\nSpeaking to camera at one stop Bill said: 'I'm in charge of Hillary's Snapchat today come along in Iowa while I tell them why she'll be the best President.'\nBut the couple's innocent posts still couldn't shake off the naughty interpretations.\nBill Clinton's Twitter account was also inundated with crude messages.\nWindswept: Bill began posting immediately on the app including one video where he spoke to camera\nModern man: An assistant filmed Bill signing autographs in an Iowa campaign event for Hillary documented on her Snapchat account\n'BE CAREFUL BILL', one thoughtful commentator wrote, while another advised him to 'get some hotties' and another warned other men: 'Hide your women!'.\nOnline sext-scandals aren't new to the Clinton campaign given the crisis that embroiled Anthony Weiner - the husband of Hillary's assistant Huma Abedbin.\nThe New York politician torpedoed his mayoral bid in 2013 when he was caught in a cyber sexting scandal for the second time, sending lewd texts and photos to various women.\nA documentary named Weiner, taken from some 400 hours of footage filmed during his campaign, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday.\nOne last push: Hillary spoke at a rally at Grand View University in Des Moines on Friday while letting husband Bill run her Snapchat account. The all important Iowa caucus vote is on Monday\nBad example: Anthony Weiner pictured stepping out in New York City hours after a documentary telling the story of his disastrous 2013 mayoral bid premiered at Sundance\nCyber scandal: Weiner sent several shirtless selfies to women including Sydney Leathers, right, during his marriage, including this image, left\nDaily Mail Online was there to see the no-holds-barred portrait of the former US Congressman as he crashed and burned, almost taking his wife Huma - Hillary Clinton's close friend and political advisor - with him.\nThe 90-minute film which will be in theaters in May and on Showtime in October reveals Huma's pain, humiliation and anger.\nAt one point she says her life's 'like living in a nightmare.' But she stands by her husband after he publicly admits violating her trust.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423405/What-possibly-wrong-Hillary-hands-Snapchat-account-Bill-day-prompting-naughty-Twitter-reaction.html"}
