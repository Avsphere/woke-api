CNBC/ Heidi Guzman Women make up about half of the world's workforce, but they are far from parity in the worlds of venture capital, hedge funds, private equity, and other Wall Street investing firms.\nThere are a lot of reasons for that, a thin pipeline of candidates, biases, and a lack of recruitment among them. What's certain is that it's not because women are less apt investors — some studies even show that female hedge fund managers outperform their male counterparts.\nA new survey of 791 industry professionals released by KPMG outlines where progress is being made and what would need to happen to close the gender gap.\nFirst, some background. Here's KPMG:\n\"In alternatives, there are certain prototypical models of a fund manager: people with certain pedigrees and characteristics, physical and otherwise,\" PAAMCO CEO Jane Buchan said in the KPMG report. \"When someone conforms to that model, there's confirmation bias. However, if a fund manager is off-model — if, for example, they are a woman — as the research shows, they need to perform substantially better to get capital.\"\nIndeed, some research shows that female managers outperform men but don't raise nearly as much money.\nHere's KPMG on a 2016 study by Rajesh Aggarwal and Nicole Boyson of Northeastern University's D'Amore-McKim School of Business. The research looked at performance of nearly 9,520 hedge funds from 1994 to 2013.\n\"The sixty-two surviving female run funds in the study had better returns and similar risk measures than their male-run peers (of which there were 1,669), but lagged male counterparts in several significant ways: the female funds had significantly less AUM ($150 million versus $222 million for male-run funds), lower management and incentive fees but longer tenure than their male-managed counterparts.\"\n\"Our data suggested no inherent differences in skills between male and female-run funds, but, in order to survive, women-run funds have to be better,\" Aggarwal, the study's coauthor, told KPMG. \"And even when they survive they don't have the same\" assets under management.\nSo how does one fix the gap? One issue is that female fund managers often say they have trouble raising money from investors, while investors say they have trouble finding female managers.\n\"That's the dichotomy of both sides of the coin,\" Kelly Rau, a KPMG audit partner who helped organize the report, told Business Insider.\nAbout six out of the 10 investor respondents said they thought there was a lack of supply in women-run funds.\nAnother issue is size. Women tend to run funds that manage less money, which means they have less resources for infrastructure that bigger investors require before investing. About one in five investors cited that as a top barrier to invest in women.\n\"Women are saying it's harder for us to raise assets, but we're here — we're here,\" Rau said. \"And the investors are saying they don't think there are enough women to invests assets in.\"\nLinkedIn screenshot. The report highlighted some areas of optimism, however. Ten percent of investor respondents now have specific mandates for funds owned or managed by women, which KPMG called a \"significant improvement\" since its 2013 survey, in which only 2% of investor respondents did.\n\"It's very encouraging,\" Kate Mitchell, a cofounder of Scale Venture Partners, told KPMG. \"We are no longer making the business case about why diversity is important — we are now talking about what we can do to change our numbers.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/kpmg-annual-study-on-women-in-alternative-investing-2016-2016-12"}
