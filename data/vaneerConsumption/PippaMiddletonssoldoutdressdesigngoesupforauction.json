Pippa's designs were originally sold to raise funds for her London to Brighton charity bike ride\n'As an ambassador of the British Heart Foundation, I’m delighted that all the profits of the sales will go towards their lifesaving research into heart disease,' she told Hello! magazine at the time.\n'Creating the limited edition pieces was a fun and creative way to fundraise for the BHF London to Brighton cycle challenge.'\nPippa did her bit to promote her designs by making an appearance at Wimbledon in the tea dress.\nSure enough silk frock and cashmere-blend scarf, both of which featured a bespoke floral pattern designed by print-specialist Tabitha, went on to sell out.\nA Keepsake sleeveless coat belonging to The Saturdays’ Mollie King (left), is also up for grabs; Made In Chelsea fans can bid for the opportunity to go on a date with Ollie Locke, one of the show's original stars\nIf neither takes your fancy, Made In Chelsea enthusiasts have the chance to win a date with Ollie Locke.\nAnd Downton Abbey followers can bid on the chance for a Valentine’s Day weekend in Highclere Castle.\nThe online auction closes at midnight on Thursday, 11 February and the money raised will go towards life saving research into heart and circulatory disease.\nIts finish coincides with the charity's annual Roll Out The Red ball, which will be hosted by Natasha Kaplinsky. Pippa will give a welcome speech at the event.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3419904/Pippa-Middleton-s-sold-dress-design-goes-auction.html"}
