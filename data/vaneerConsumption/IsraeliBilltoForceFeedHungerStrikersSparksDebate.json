More than 300 of the prisoners are on hunger strike, among them 175 administrative detainees, who can spend years in prison without being charged, he said.\n\"There is a fear that riots will ensue...in the case of the death of a prisoner.\"\nYoel Hadar of the Public Security Ministry, which launched the bill, said force-feeding would be a last resort and a needed safeguard for Israel’s security.\n“There is fear that riots will ensue inside prisons, in the Judia and Samaria, Israel and even around the world in the case of the death of a prisoner on hunger strike,” he said, using the biblical name some in Israel use to refer to the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians hope one day will become part of an independent state.\nForce-feeding also does not run counter to international conventions, he said, adding that it is practiced in Austria and Australia.\nThe Israeli government came under renewed pressure on Friday when U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was concerned about the worsening health of Palestinian hunger strikers.\n\"The Secretary-General is concerned about reports regarding the deteriorating health of Palestinian administrative detainees who have been on hunger strike for over a month,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. \"He reiterates his long-standing position that administrative detainees should be charged or released without delay.\"\nIsraeli security services contend that administrative detention is central to the war on terror and abolishing it would hamper efforts to stop terror attacks.\nBan Ki-moon’s statement will surely be welcomed by Palestinians whose loved ones are detained.\nHasan Al-Warydan, whose 36-year-old son Mahmoud has spent eight years in administrative detention and is one of the hunger strikers, supports his son’s right to protest what he considers to be illegal detention.\n\"It's my son’s right to go on hunger strike, and this is his way to protest his imprisonment in Israeli jail without filing charges and without any trial,\" he said, adding that Mahmoud had lost some 55 pounds while on strike.\n\"Instead of forcing them to eat, they should force the Israeli security services to release them,\" he said.\nReuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/israeli-bill-force-feed-hunger-strikers-sparks-debate-n126266"}
