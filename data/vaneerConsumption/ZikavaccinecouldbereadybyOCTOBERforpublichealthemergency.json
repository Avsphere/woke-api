That's because, unlike other viruses that have had recent outbreaks, Zika was assumed to be 'mild' and no vaccine had been in development\n'The first thing is to be ready for the worst,' Kobinger, who helped develop a trial vaccine that was successful in fighting Ebola in Guinea, said.\n'This vaccine is easy to produce. It could be cranked to very high levels in a really short time.' He did not say when it could be widely available.\nThe United States has two potential candidates for a Zika vaccine and may begin clinical trials in people by the end of this year, but there will not be a widely available vaccine for several years, U.S. officials said on Thursday.\nThe mosquito-transmitted virus has been linked to brain damage in thousands of babies in Brazil. There is no proven vaccine or treatment for Zika, a close cousin of dengue and chikungunya, which causes mild fever and rash.\nAn estimated 80 percent of people infected have no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected.\nIn Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that Zika is spreading 'explosively' and could affect as many as four million people in the Americas.\nKobinger, the lead scientist on this project from Quebec City's Laval University and head of special pathogens at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, is working with the University of Pennsylvania, led by scientist David Weiner, Inovio Pharmaceuticals and South Korea's GeneOne Life Science.\nJoseph Kim, chief executive of Inovio, said the timeline to make the vaccine available by year's end is aggressive, but possible.\n'I believe this will be the first to go into human testing. We believe we're ahead of the pack in the race for a Zika vaccine,' he said in an interview.\nInovio shares on the Nasdaq jumped 7.6 percent on Thursday to close at $5.78.\nTHE RACE FOR A ZIKA VACCINE Privately owned vaccine developer Hawaii Biotech Inc has joined the race to produce a vaccine for the mosquito-borne Zika virus, a fast-spreading infection which has been linked to severe birth defects in babies. The company initiated a formal program to test a Zika vaccine last fall, as the virus began to gain traction in Brazil, said Chief Executive Dr. Elliot Parks. 'Right now, we are in the pre-clinical stage, as I suspect everyone is,' Parks, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the Zika virus is 'spreading explosively' and could infect as many as 4 million people in the Americas. There is no proven vaccine or treatment. Although a direct causal relationship has not been established, a link is strongly suspected between Zika and thousands of children born in Brazil with abnormally small heads, brain defects and impaired vision. A close cousin of dengue and chikungunya, Zika causes mild fever and rash. But an estimated 80 percent of those infected suffer no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected. 'We will have data coming through this year,' Parks said. 'When we enter the clinic is yet to be determined.' The United States has two potential candidates for a Zika vaccine and may begin clinical trials in people by the end of this year, but there will not be a widely available vaccine for several years, U.S. officials said on Thursday. Canadian scientist Gary Kobinger, who helped develop a trial vaccine that was successful in fighting Ebola, is part of a consortium working on a Zika vaccine that could be ready for emergency use before the end of the year. This week, GlaxoSmithKline Plc also said it was concluding studies to check whether its technology is suitable for the virus. Parks and his team at Hawaii Biotech are initially funding development themselves, while looking ultimately to partner with a big player that would have the ability to deliver a vaccine worldwide. The Honolulu, Hawaii-based company, which is also testing vaccines for infectious diseases including West Nile virus and chikungunya, sold its early-stage dengue vaccine candidate to Merck & Co Inc in 2010. It also has a tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccine in the pre-clinical stage, funded by a grant from the infectious disease arm of the National Institutes of Health.\nOther vaccine candidates appear to be moving more slowly.\nThe Sao Paulo-based Butantan Institute said last week it planned to develop a vaccine 'in record time,' although its director warned this was still likely to take three to five years.\nThe candidate vaccine Kobinger is working on mimics the virus, triggering the body's immune system, he said.\n'When the real thing comes in, then the antibodies are there, the immune system is primed, it's ready to attack right away,' Kobinger said.\nDr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there have been 31 cases of Zika infection among U.S. citizens who traveled to areas affected by the virus. So far, there have been no cases of transmission of the virus through mosquitoes in the United States, she said.\nA 6-week old baby born with microcephaly is treated at the Lessa de Andrade polyclinic during a physical therapy session on January 29, 2016 in Recife, Pernambuco state, Brazil. Health officials believe as many as 100,000 people have been exposed to the Zika virus in Recife, although most never develop symptoms. In the last four months, authorities have recorded around 4,000 cases in Brazil in which the mosquito-borne Zika virus may have led to microcephaly in infants. The ailment results in an abnormally small head in newborns and is associated with various disorders including decreased brain development.\nIn Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that Zika is spreading 'explosively' and could affect as many as four million people in the Americas.\nIt said the mosquito-borne disease had gone from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions and admitted up to four million people could be infected.\nThe agency will convene an emergency committee of disease experts on Monday.\nIt comes after US experts claimed WHO was not taking a leadership role in the Zika pandemic.\nThey said the organisation needed to learn lessons from its handling of the Ebola epidemic where the 'agency's failure to act decisively cost thousands of lives'.\nThe WHO says it has set up measures to fight the spread including surveillance, laboratories for testing, clinical care and vector control - killing off the mosquitoes spreading the infection.\nBut Dr Amesh Adalja, senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, told dailymail.com that officials shouldn't expect any fast results from vaccines.\nBefore the current outbreak – which is linked to a surge in babies being born with abnormally small heads – Zika was not considered to be a public health risk.\nDr Adalja told Daily Mail Online: 'There wasn't any vaccine development being undertaken prior to this outbreak in Brazil.\nThe virus is spread through the Aedes mosquito (pictured). As a vaccine won't be available anytime soon, the medical community should focus on wiping out the mosquito that transmits the disease, the expert said\n'It will be quite a while – and this is on the scale of about a decade for a vaccine to be developed usually.'\nThere is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika, which is a close cousin of dengue and chikungunya, two viruses that cause mild fever and rash.\nApproximately 80 per cent of people who are infected with Zika have no symptoms.\nThe other 20 per cent experience 'mild' symptoms, such as fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes.\nAs a result, there weren't any Zika vaccines in the pipeline, according to Dr Adalja.\nBut in recent months, the virus has been linked to a rare birth defect called microcephaly – in which a newborn's head is smaller than normal and the brain may not have developed properly.\nThe virus has been found in 24 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe World Health Organization has warned it will soon spread to all countries across the Americas, except for Canada and Chile.\nA lot of people might be thinking that all of the sudden they had an Ebola vaccine. This is different from Ebola – that vaccine had been in development for many years Dr Amesh Adalja, senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\nDr Adalja explained that the public incorrectly assumes a vaccine will be available shortly – because of the rapid vaccine that was made available shortly after the Ebola crisis struck.\nHe said: 'A lot of people might be thinking that all of the sudden they had an Ebola vaccine.\n'This is different from Ebola – that vaccine had been in development for many years.'\nBut now that Zika has become a public health concern, researchers are going into overdrive.\nFirst off, scientists will have to do 'some basic science' to see if parts of the virus can be presented to the immune system, according to Dr Adalja.\nThat phase of the research may involve animal studies in the laboratory – and will involve investigating different ways that the immune system may react to the virus.\nAnd once the first step is completed, scientists will next have to determine whether the vaccine is safe or if it has a high burden of side effects.\nThey will also have to look into if the vaccine triggers any autoimmune reactions.\nDr Adalja said: 'It takes time, and there are a lot of steps where the process can fail, but it seems to me that because of Zika's ability to affect fetal abnormalities, it will become a priority.'\nHe noted that the vaccine won't work just to limit the disease in adults – but also to limit the effect it can have on fetuses.\nHowever, for the time being, there is no cure for Zika.\nThe doctor said: 'Once a person is infected, there is nothing that you can do.\nIt takes time, and there are a lot of steps where the process can fail, but it seems to me that because of Zika's ability to affect fetal abnormalities, it will become a priority Dr Adalja\n'If a pregnant woman is infected, there is no treatment that can be done to protect the fetus – it either happens or it doesn't.'\nThe best way to prevent a fetus from getting infected right now is for pregnant women to avoid travelling to regions that are affected by the virus.\nDr Adalja added: 'While we wait for a vaccine, people really need to focus the battle on the mosquitoes that are transmitting the virus.'\nA developer recently revealed it created a genetically modified mosquito that reduces the number of mosquitoes spreading Zika.\nOxitec, a UK-subsidiary of US synthetic biology company Intrexon, said it developed a self-limiting strain of the Aedes aegypti mosquito.\nThe male mosquitoes were modified so that their offspring will die before reaching adulthood or being able to reproduce.\nThe company said it saw strong results in controlling the population of the Aedes vector that carries Zika and also the dengue virus.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3422951/Zika-vaccine-ready-OCTOBER-Researchers-claim-experimental-vaccine-easy-produce-given-ahead-public-health-emergency.html"}
