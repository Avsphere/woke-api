There was also the creative force of Ilkay Gundogan, who arrived for £20m.\nIt was a bad night for Pep Guardiola as Manchester City were dumped out by Monaco\nTiemoue Bakayoko headed home the decisive goal with 13 minutes remaining in Monaco\nBut after Monaco tore City to shreds at the Stade Louis II, dumping Guardiola out at the Champions League last-16 stage for the first time, it's startlingly clear where this summer's priorities should lie.\nHaving been overrun in the first half, City were just 19 minutes away from making it through when Sane scored. Once again, it was their defensive line that let them down when it mattered most.\nMonaco, who looked out on their feet after half-time, were able to score from a set-piece, delivered into the penalty area by Thomas Lemar and headed into the net with alarming ease by Tiemoue Bakayoko.\nBut those warning bells had been clanging much earlier, with the goals from Kylian Mbappe and Fabinho the result of serious defensive breaches.\nThe consensus of those analysing the game was clear. BT Sport pundit Rio Ferdinand called City's defending 'pathetic' while Roy Keane on ITV Sport said: 'City don't have enough defensive-minded players. Pep doesn't have the players to do it, some are not good enough. He needs at least five or six.'\nGuardiola yells at John Stones during what was a terrible defensive performance\nStones was left to retrieve the ball from the net after Bakayoko came up with the winner\nFernandinho looks distraught at the final whistle after City exited at the last-16 stage\nGuardiola, however, refuses to blame his defence for what is an immensely disappointing early European exit, especially after winning the first leg 5-3 in Manchester.\nStones partnered Aleksandar Kolarov in the heart of the City back line, with the fit-again Vincent Kompany not even making the substitutes' bench. How they missed his authority and experience of such European occasions.\nNicolas Otamendi and Pablo Zabaleta were among the subs, but neither made it onto the pitch, which speaks volumes for Guardiola's faith in them to handle Monaco's vibrant and rapid front line.\nCity players look dejected after Bakayoko scored Monaco's winning goal on Wednesday night\nKevin De Bruyne reflects at the end as Manchester City's European run came to an end\nOtamendi, who hasn't ever come close to justifying his £28.5m transfer fee, suffered a torrid time in the first leg at the Etihad Stadium as City trailed 2-1 and 3-2 before asserting themselves.\nGiven this, it was surprising how naive City seemed to the potent Monaco threat early on in the second leg.\nThey received a wake-up call moments before the opening goal, when Fernandinho, pushed so deep as to practically be a third centre-back, sloppily surrendered possession to Bakayoko.\nWith Stones and Kolarov committed further forward than they should have been, it took just one pass to unlock City's defence, with Mbappe racing through. Their blushes were spared by a fine Willy Caballero save.\nCity were almost exposed two minutes before Monaco's opening goal when Fernandinho lost possession sloppily and the hosts pushed men forward against City's stretched defence\nWith the City defenders out of position, it required just one through pass from Bakayoko to set Mbappe in the clear - on this occasion, Caballero saved their skin\nTwo minutes later and they weren't so lucky. Again Fernandinho lost possession and Benjamin Mendy was simply allowed by Sane and Sergio Aguero to advance into the box.\nBoth those attacking players then failed to track back, allowing Bernardo Silva space and time to cross and find Mbappe, astonishingly one of four Monaco players in the six-yard box, to poke home.\nAnother sloppy loss of possession by Fernandinho led to Monaco's opening goal, with Benjamin Mendy able to step inside Leroy Sane and Sergio Aguero\nNeither Sane nor Aguero offer a challenge, allowing Mendy free passage into the City area. Looking up, he sees five red and white shirts to aim for and the same number of defenders\nA well-timed defensive tackle averts initial danger, but Aguero simply doesn't notice that Bernardo Silva is free behind his left shoulder\nAs Silva has plenty of time to assess his options, there are remarkably four Monaco players in the six-yard box and just three City defenders\nThe low cross evades the City man at the front post and Mbappe is able to poke it home\nCity had greater numbers back for Monaco's second goal just before the half-hour, but a failure of anyone to take any responsibility allowed Fernandinho to fire home.\nIt certainly didn't help that Stones had been dragged hopelessly out of position as he tried to cover for Bacary Sagna and cut out Mendy's cross.\nNobody tracked Fabinho's dart and the best efforts of Kolarov to prevent the goal were too little, too late.\nAs Mendy (out of shot) crosses for Monaco's second goal, it appears City have the situation under control, despite John Stones (No 24) being dragged out of position\nBut nobody has picked up the penalty box run of Fabinho, who slots the ball home despite a desperate lunging tackle by Kolarov\nBut it is the positioning for the third, decisive goal late on that is the most shocking.\nWhen Lemar whips in the free-kick, the City players are enforcing a defensive line more than 20 yards from goal. There really shouldn't be a problem here.\nYet a split-second later there are three Monaco players between Kolarov, who thinks he can head the ball clear but woefully mistimes his leap, and Stones. It left Bakayoko unmarked to place a header past Caballero and send City into oblivion.\nAs Lemar prepares to deliver the free-kick, City appear to have the situation under control with a line of light blue shirts some 20 yards away from the goal\nHowever, a split-second later and three Monaco players have managed to get between central defenders Stones and Kolarov as the ball flies in\nKolarov thinks he can head the ball clear but his jump is badly mistimed and the ball flies over him towards the three Monaco players behind who he has left unmarked\nKolarov twists round in despair as the ball reaches the head of Bakayoko behind him\nThere is a look of horror on Stones' face as Bakayoko heads home the winning goal\nThis shambolic defensive performance illustrated that City need to spend big on defensive reinforcements over the summer.\nThey'll hate to admit it, but Keane is right. It may take the signing of five or six top quality defensive players to solve all the problems that Monaco so brilliantly exposed during a classic last-16 tie.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4319474/Manchester-City-spend-big-defenders.html"}
