We would love to have the recipe for their Charred Teriyaki Brussels Sprouts. Thanks. — Barbara Selby, Marietta\nExecutive chef Derek Dollar was happy to share this recipe. It’s his creation and the sprouts are on the menu all year ‘round.\nWe cut the recipe for the teriyaki sauce down to a quarter of what they make at the restaurant, but it’s still a good bit. Don’t restrict your use to Brussels sprouts. We’re using the extra on pretty much everything coming off the grill and for stir frying luscious summer vegetables.\n﻿The Big Ketch, 3279 Roswell Road, Atlanta, 404-474-9508 and ﻿1105 Canton St., Roswell, 770-993-5749. thebigketch.com\nIs there a recipe from a metro Atlanta restaurant you’d like to make at home?
