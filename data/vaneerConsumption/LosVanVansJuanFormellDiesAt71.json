It was announced on Cuban state television, though the cause of death was not given.\nLos Van Van became Cuba's most famous big band orchestra and also had a large fan base overseas. His songs told the social history of the island with a sense of humor and reflected Cuban's concerns and joys.\nAs a young man Formell joined various important musical groups and collaborated with well-known musicians such as Guillermo Rubalcaba.\n\"My life has been entirely dedicated to music and only makes sense when people make it theirs and enjoy it,\" said Formell when he received the Latin Grammy for Excellence in 2013.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/los-van-vans-juan-formell-dies-71-n96006"}
