Tom Cotton (R-AR) pointed out that on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s server were emails about recently executed Iranian nuclear scientist Shahram Amiri\n“You mentioned the Iranian scientist that was recently executed. Of course, I’m not going to comment on what he may or may not have done for the United States government,” Cotton said. “But in the emails that were on Hillary Clinton’s private server, there were conversations among her senior advisers about this gentleman. That goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information a private server. I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe.”\n(h/t The Hill)\nFollow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/08/07/cotton-hillary-emails-executed-nuclear-scientist-iran/"}
