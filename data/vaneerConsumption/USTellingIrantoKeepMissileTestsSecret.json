Bring us the details [of the missiles].’ After that, they will say: ‘We need to set up cameras.’ And, finally, they will say: ‘Either saw [the missiles into pieces] or, like [Libyan dictator Mu’ammar] Gadhafi, load them on to a ship and hand [them] over to us.’ ”\n“They are clearly deluding themselves. Nothing like this will ever happen,” he added.\nNevertheless, Hajizadeh said, it is up to Iran to confront America.\n“We must act. If we do not, we will witness daily their exaggerated and evil demands.”\nA request by the Washington Free Beacon for a response was declined by a State Department official, who said that it is U.S. policy to avoid responding publicly to Iran.\n“We generally don’t comment on public remarks by Iranian officials, and especially IRGC officials,” the official told the Free Beacon. “We’re not going to start now.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/05/17/iranian-commander-u-s-telling-iran-keep-missile-tests-secret/"}
