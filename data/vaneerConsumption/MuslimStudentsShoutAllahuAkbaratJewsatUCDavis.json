The motion passed, and two days later a Jewish fraternity was vandalized with swastikas, in an act of apparent intimidation.\nHere is the video, via YouTube and the Washington Free Beacon:\nThe term “Allahu Akbar” means “Allah is the greatest.” It is an ordinary declaration of Muslim faith, but in the context of political demonstrations it is also a declaration of loyalty to radical Islam, and is frequently shouted at anti-Israel and anti-American protests. By using the chant in response to a call of “Takbir,” the Muslim students demonstrated–to each other and to the outside world–that the true audience for their vote against Israel is not UC Davis campus but the Muslim world.\nA Facebook post by one of the student senators (via National Review and the Clarion Project), which appeared somewhat tongue-in-check, advertised that “Hamas and Shariah law have taken over UC Davis.”\nThe video lends that remark a rather more chilling connotation, and suggests that radical Islamists have considerable influence and sympathy among students at University of California campuses. Other campuses have begun passing divestment resolutions in recent months.\nSenior Editor-at-Large Joel B.
