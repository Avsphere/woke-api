So they’re sharing pictures of the guy in his birthday suit in the hopes someone knows his, uh, body type.\nTo be clear, the sheriff’s office has blurred certain parts of the photo so it is acceptable for public viewing.\n“Someone may recognize this subject's body type,” the sheriff’s office said, “or the fact that he likes to shower naked in folks' yards at 3 in the afternoon.”\nAccording to officials, the man parked at the private residence on Armour Bridge Road near Walker Church Road in Greensboro. He emerged from a blue or gray truck “completely naked with a plastic bag over his head to obscure his identity,” then used “painters tape to obscure a camera near the back door of the house,” the sheriff’s office said in the Facebook post.\nAnother camera he did not see caught him using the shower, then leaving the residence.\n“Homeowners are still doing an inventory to determine if anything is missing,” the sheriff’s office said.\nThe hunt is on in Greene County, which is about 75 miles east of downtown Atlanta.\nAnyone who recognizes the man is asked to call Capt. Lee Stancill at 706-523-6468.\n“You can stay anonymous,” the sheriff’s office said.\nIn other news:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/bolo-with-plastic-bag-his-head-naked-man-showers-someone-yard/rbLs8fSXHoCK50LlDaPnzK/"}
