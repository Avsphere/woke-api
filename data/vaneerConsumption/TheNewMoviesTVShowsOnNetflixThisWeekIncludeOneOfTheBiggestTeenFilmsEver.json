As the streaming site has invested billions of dollars into developing its own original content, its library of classic films has continually dwindled. But that doesn't mean Netflix no longer offers any older movies, and this week's new releases offer a reprieve for those fans who prefer oldies to the new productions the site is cooking up. The movies and shows hitting Netflix this week are mostly made up of older Hollywood films, some of which can be considered classics. And films don't get much more classic than The Breakfast Club.\nThe 1985 film from '80s comedy master John Hughes is considered to be one of the greatest teen movies of all time, and if you've never seen it, now's your chance. The movie is about five high schoolers who each represent a different stereotype — a brain, a criminal, an athlete, a princess, and a basket case — who all end up spending an eight hour Saturday detention together in their school library. After lots of tension, the group comes to understand that they're really not so different and all face similar problems, and the film has long been lauded (despite some bits that don't really hold up through a modern lens) as one of the best coming-of-age films ever made.\nSo if you've never seen it, or if it's been a while, be sure and check out The Breakfast Club when it hits Netflix, along with all of the other top movies and shows hitting the site this week, listed below.\n1 'The Breakfast Club' - Sept 1 Movieclips Classic Trailers on YouTube John Hughes was in top form when he crafted this classic.\n2 '10,000 B.C.' - Sept 1 Movieclips Classic Trailers on YouTube Like your dialogue light and your saber-toothed tigers plentiful?
