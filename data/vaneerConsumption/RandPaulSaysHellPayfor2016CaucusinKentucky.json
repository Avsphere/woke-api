(AP) — Republican Rand Paul says he has contributed $250,000 and pledged another $200,000 to pay for a proposed GOP presidential caucus in his home state of Kentucky next year.\nState GOP officials are scheduled to vote Saturday on rules for the proposed March 5 caucus.\nThe state party’s proposed switch from a primary to a caucus would allow Paul to run for president and re-election to his U.S. Senate seat simultaneously without violating a state law banning candidates from appearing on the ballot twice.\nIn a letter to party officials, Paul says he transferred $250,000 to a state GOP account. He pledged to raise or transfer another $200,000. He says the caucus will cost an estimated $400,000 to $500,000.\nMore money would come from filing fees paid by candidates.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that Paul is sticking to his commitment to defray caucus costs. McConnell has endorsed the caucus.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/08/17/rand-paul-says-hell-pay-for-kentucky-to-switch-from-primary-to-caucus/"}
