(Photo: Channel 2 Action News)\nThe warrants involve allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with three East Point women during Gooddine’s employment with the East Point Police Department in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nGooddine was accused this month of stalking a 15-year-old girl and her mother at a local hospital hours after he sexually assaulted the teen; he has maintained his innocence. Since then, three previous allegations of sexual misconduct or inappropriate touching have come to light, including a case from 2011.\nThe warrants include allegations of aggravated sexual battery and child molestation, and an attempt by Goodine to intimidate the most recent victim while she received treatment at Atlanta Medical Center South.\nAttorney Thomas Reynolds, who represents the 15-year-old victim in the latest case, said in a statement to Channel 2 that it’s “astonishing it took over seven years and four victims to reach this point.”\n“The family will undoubtedly be relieved that this individual, who hid behind the protection of his badge, will finally have to face legal consequences for the allegations against him,” Reynolds said. “We are thankful for the bravery of the past victims and witnesses who have come forward and we encourage others who may have useful information to continue reaching out to our office so we can pursue justice for the victims.\"\nMORE: Officer accused of sexually assaulting girl, stalking her at hospital\nRELATED: Officer accused of sexual assault faced similar accusations years ago — but wasn’t prosecuted\nLike Atlanta News Now on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/warrants-issued-for-east-point-cop-accused-sexual-assault/oPra7ToeqoXhaK2kECezhL/"}
