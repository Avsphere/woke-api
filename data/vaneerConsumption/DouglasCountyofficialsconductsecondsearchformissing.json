Glenn Daniel said Tuesday.\nLocal and state fire, police and sheriff’s officials scoured nearly 500 acres of wooded and open areas of property around Hunter Park, where Bolen’s vehicle was found several days after his disappearance.\n“The decision was made at the end of the day that the search had covered all the best probable areas, sometimes even twice,” Daniel said.\nPrevious searches for Bolen have proved unsuccessful, too.\nInvestigators said they have received several tips and followed up on leads that yielded no results. Investigators also said they have continued to communicate with the family and the public to develop new leads.\nThe case remains open, Daniel said.\nAnyone with information on Bolen’s whereabouts can contact the Douglas sheriff’s office.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/douglas-county-officials-conduct-second-search-for-missing-teacher/MOlvoEd2E00P2R3uegzLPP/"}
