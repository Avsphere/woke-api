Of course I’m not hiding. I’m fine in myself and I’ve got confidence in my team.\n“On a personal level, I’ve been through a lot over the years and it’s important to make sure that you can look at yourself and say that there has been no wrongdoing. I’m confident of that.\n“From a personal point of view, you’ve got to put the team first and the riders first and think about what is good for them and what’s good for our owners.\n“When I started years and years ago, cycling in Britain when I was riding, there was hardly a sport to speak of.\n“Now we’ve got millions of people riding bikes. It’s a massive sport and I’m proud to have played a part in that.\n“Team Sky and British Cycling have been a part of that and hopefully it will continue to do so in the years to come.”\nThe team remain embroiled in controversy relating to a ‘mystery’ package which was delivered to then Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine – a race won by Sir Bradley Wiggins – and three therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) granted to Wiggins in 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nOn Tuesday, Team Sky published a letter and supporting documents sent by Brailsford to Damian Collins MP, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, in which Brailsford reiterated his belief that the team was not guilty of breaching anti-doping rules. Wiggins has also denied wrongdoing.\nMoments after the statement was published Graham McWilliam, the chairman of the Team Sky board, used Twitter to say the board remained “100 per cent behind team and Sir Dave Brailsford” following suggestions that some riders might want the team principal to resign.\nPleased to see @TeamSky challenging some of the inaccurate commentary of recent days... (1/2) — Graham McWilliam (@grahammcwilliam) March 7, 2017\nFor record, TS Board & Sky are 100% behind team and Sir Dave Brailsford as its leader. We look forward to many more years of success (2/2) — Graham McWilliam (@grahammcwilliam) March 7, 2017\nThree-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome was not among the riders who publicly declared their support for Brailsford on Twitter this week.\n“We had a good conversation, that’s it,” Brailsford added.\nUKAD is investigating whether the team and British Cycling violated anti-doping rules when the package, addressed to Freeman, was delivered to Team Sky at the end of the 2011 Criterium.\nBrailsford has said he was told the package contained the legal decongestant Fluimucil, but as yet no documentary evidence has been produced.\nBrailsford added: “I’m disappointed that anything from the past, I’m not saying that there was any wrongdoing, but that the current guys within the team get any reflection from something, which has nothing to do with them.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4301468/Sir-Dave-Brailsford-not-quit-Team-Sky-post-mystery-package-furore.html"}
