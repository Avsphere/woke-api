Her disappearance sparked global interest as pictures of her and her grieving parents were published around the world.\nFILE- In this July 24, 2008 file photo, former detective Goncalo Amaral in the Madeleine McCann case poses next to her photo with his book, whose title translates as \"The Truth in the Lies\", during its launch in Lisbon.
