Reeves then arranged trysts with the men at Athens-area motels, Athens-Clarke police Commander Lt. Mike Tyndell told the paper.\nIn each scenario, the men had “almost identical” experiences with Reeves. After having sex with the woman, two accomplices popped out of the bathroom and beat and robbed the victims, demanding their ATM cards and PINs in both incidents, the paper reported.\nOne victim— a 19-year-old — immediately reported the robbery to police, saying “they put him on the floor and zip tied his wrists and duct taped his mouth, then beat him some more,” Tyndall said.\nOn Tuesday, the 47-year-old second victim came forward to report that he was also robbed by Reeves, police said.\nRead more of the story here.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/alleged-atlanta-escort-charged-robberies-athens-motels/7v1U94GgYIi1QmUOXgStxO/"}
