Rising water levels in spring could lead to the breach of the 3.6-km (2.2-mile) long structure\nKurdish fighters stood guard at Mosul Dam in Iraq in August 2015 after they and Iraqi forces retook the dam from the Islamic State\nThere is also the possibility that the dam is breached in the summer or fall, when the water level is lower.\nIn a call to Iraq's prime minister Haider al-Abadi, US president Barack Obama highlighted the need to make emergency repairs to avoid the tragedy.\nGen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also stressed the importance of carrying out maintenance works at the dam during a meeting with Abadi in Baghdad.\nAmerican officials called on the Iraqi government to start warning its citizens about the perils of a possible breach in the dam, and where to find safety should the dam collapse.\nBuilt in 1984 by a German and Italian consortium and located 30 miles upstream from Mosul, Iraq's biggest dam has long been a maintenance nightmare, with serious structural flaws.\nSome 600 Iraqis worked at the site, relentlessly drilling holes in the gypsum base under the structure and filling them with a cement grout mixture.\nThe operation, which was carried out three times a day, six days a week, was a desperate attempt to prevent water from eroding the dam's base.\nISIS fighters took over the dam in August 2014 raising fears that they might blow it up and unleash a wall of water on Mosul and Baghdad that could kill thousands of civilians.\nIn a joint Kurdish and Iraqi effort, the dam was wrestled back at the end of the month.\nBut many of the Iraqi workers did not return to the site and the Iraqi government failed to resume regular maintenance.\nThe Obama administration installed 92 instruments to measure the pressure on the dam and the sediment in the water nearby to assess the rate at which the gypsum base was disintegrating.\nPrime Minister Matteo Renzi said in December that the country would deploy 450 troops near the site to protect workers carrying out repairs\nISIS fighters took over the dam in August 2014 raising fears that they might blow it up and unleash a wall of water on Mosul and Baghdad that could kill thousands of civilians. The site was wrestled back at the end of the month by a joint Iraqi-Kurdish operation\nBut it stopped short from undertaking the costly repair project itself, urging instead the World Bank to agree that that $200 million of a $1.2 billion loan for Iraq would be for Mosul Dam repairs.\nItaly also stepped up efforts to protect the dam. An Italian company, the Trevi Group, has been negotiating with the Iraqi government to make emergency repairs at an estimated cost of more than $380million, according to Iraqi officials. Trevi said work will start almost immediately to 'safeguard the stability' of a dam that 'is seriously damaged,'\n'The presence of the Italian contingent alongside the Iraqi army and international forces is fundamentally important for the security of the project,' the statement said.\nPrime Minister Matteo Renzi said in December that the country would deploy 450 troops near the site to protect workers carrying out repairs.\nRenzi said the dam project was a concrete way to safeguard civilians and oppose Islamist militants. Italy has not joined France and US in air strikes on ISIS in Syria.\n'Everybody was saying 'let's bomb here', 'let's bomb there', 'bomb, bomb'. I said, 'Let's do something useful',' Renzi said in an interview with Italian radio.\nThe dam must be repaired because it could cause a civilian disaster,' Renzi said. 'We will fix the dam and the workers will be defended by our troops, who are already present in Iraq.'\nHowever, plans to send Italian troops have stalled after the head of Iraq's ministry of water resources Moshin al-Shammari, also a supporter of the anti-American Shia cleric Moktada al-Sadr, said that Iraq did not need any 'foreign support' in guarding the dam\n'There is no need for Italian forces to protect the dam,' Mahdi Rasheed, an adviser to Mr. Shammari, said Sunday in a telephone interview.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3394369/Crumbling-dam-collapse-killing-500-000-people-poor-maintenance-year-Iraqi-forces-reclaimed-ISIS.html"}
