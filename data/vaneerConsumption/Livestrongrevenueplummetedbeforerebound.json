Contributions fell to $3.7 million from $11.9 million the previous year. Total revenue fell to $6.2 million from $16.6 million and the charity was forced to spend cash reserves to cover operations.\nLivestrong officials say it remains healthy and had the money to survive. President Greg Lee also says donations are rising again and patient services have expanded as the charity settles into its new normal of a smaller, leaner organization.\nLee says revenue got a bounce in 2016 and is trending up in 2017.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4448236/Livestrong-revenue-plummeted-rebound.html"}
