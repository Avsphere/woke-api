One version is a sedan and the other is speculated to be a crossover, but both will sell for about $30,000 and be on the market sometime in 2017\n'The biggest tidbit I’ve heard from a second-hand source is that Tesla is readying at least 2 different versions of its Model 3 for the March launch,' said Seth Weintraub of Electrek.\n'One version is a sedan and another is a small crossover built on the same platform.'\nWeintraub referenced a presentation that Tesla gave at a Hong Kong meeting this week that showed both a sedan and a crossover vehicle.\nOne version of the Model 3 is a sedan and the other is a small crossover built on the same platform.\nThe base price for the Model 3 will be about $35,000 before government subsidies, Weintraub says, which means that it will likely cost less than the $30,000 Chevy Bolt when it's released.\nWHAT ELECTREK BELIEVES ABOUT NEW MODEL 3 Battery size: Tesla needs to beat GM's range but can do it with the same amount of battery — so something around the same 60kWh on the base model should get Tesla to 240 miles with low drag, light aluminum body, efficient motors and regeneration. There will also likely be a long-range battery which could be as high as 80kWh or eventually 90kWh. Superchargers: A big cost savings will be supercharging at a fee. Rather than include 'free supercharging for life' like Tesla does with its Model S and X vehicles (it was originally a $2500 option), Tesla will want to associate a credit card with the car and automatically charge on an as-needed basis. Delivery: If Tesla follows their current pattern, and there is no reason to believe that they won't, they will begin shipping higher end varieties of the Model 3 to the first reservation holders at the currently scheduled end of 2017. From there, a wider roll out of base model vehicles will hit the road in 2018 as production ramps. Source: Electrek\nThe article also talks about a smaller SUV or CUV that Tesla could debut following the unveiling of the Model 3.\nThis vehicle would have Falcon doors and the same 'pancake' electric battery platform as new the new sedan.\nHowever, a Tesla spokesperson called this report “wrong” and that only 1 of the vehicles would be announced in March.\nThe news came from a reporter at Electrek who heard it from a second-hand source that confirmed the rumors. One version of the Model 3 is a sedan and the other is a small crossover built on the same platform. The article discusses a smaller SUV or CUV that Teslacould debut following the the Model 3\nThe crossover could end up being the Model Y, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk blatantly hinted at in October last year.\nMusk tweeted 'a Model 3 and a Model Y',\nOne of the two will [have falcon-wing doors].' Musk quickly deleted the tweet.\nThe Model Y would be the vehicle to complete the model's S.3.X.Y. lineup.\nThis vehicle would have Falcon doors and the same 'pancake' electric battery platform as new the new sedan – news that has been out since June 2015. A spokesperson from Tesla contacted Electrek, who updated the original post, claiming this report was 'incorrect', reported Jalopnik .\nAnd the CFO, JB Straubel, also made a few comments suggesting the Model Y will be similar to the Model X, but less expensive and based on the smaller Model 3.\nElectrek's source said the Model Y would cost about $5,000 more than the Model 3, which is similar to the price difference between the Model S and the Model X.\nIS THIS TESLA'S FIRST EVER TV AD? Tesla has revealed what could become its first ever TV ad, showing off its Autopilot feature. It follows the rollout out Autopilot software to 60,000 owners, including Model S sedans made after September 2014 and Model X SUVs. The advert may be a response to the series of YouTube videos that showed a number of drivers using the feature irresponsibly. The video shows the driver summoning his car remotely, keeping it's lane on a highway and self-parallel parking at the end. The Autopilot feature has an autosteer functionality, which is currently in beta, and keeps the car in the current lane while maintaining speed. When the driver flicks the indicator switch and turn signal, the Model S will move itself to the adjacent lane when safe to do so. Side Collision Warning alerts drivers to objects, such as cars, that are too close to the side of Model S. When the car detects an object close to its side, fluid lines will appear around an image of the Model S image in the instrument panel. Model S can now park itself. When driving at low speeds around cities, a 'P' will appear on the instrument panel when the Tesla detects a parking spot. The Autopark guide appears on the touchscreen along with the rear camera display, and, once activated, Autopark will begin to park itself by controlling steering and vehicle speed.\nBut there is no question that the Model 3 will be unveiled this March, and that the firm is working on another new vehicle that would share its platform.\nElectric car manufacturers have to design futuristic vehicles to entice buyers in order to ride out the challenge of plunging oil prices, Musk said earlier this week.\nThe luxury all-electric US car maker, founded in 2003, rose to prominence as oil prices soared and made alternative energy vehicles more tempting.\nElektrek's source said the Model Y would cost about $5,000 more than the Model 3, which is similar to the price difference between the Model S and the Model X. But there is no question that the Model 3 will be unveiled this March, and that the firm is working on another new vehicle that would share its platform\nNow the fledgling industry is under pressure, said Musk.\nTesla itself saw shares dive earlier this month after it reported deliveries at the bottom end of its forecast for the 2015 fourth quarter.\n'It definitely makes the transition to sustainable energy more difficult,' Musk, said when asked at a business conference in Hong Kong about the impact of free-falling oil prices.\nReporter Seth Weintraub noted that he could not confirm the source's statements, he but referenced a presentation that Tesla gave at a Hong Kong meeting this week that showed both a sedan and a crossover vehicle\n'No doubt that is going to dampen interest in electric vehicles in general,' Musk told the 'StartmeupHK' event.\nTesla is looking to recruit 1,600 software engineers to help develop 'Autopilot', its autonomous car IT system and aims to have a fully self-driving car by 2018. 'What we're aspiring to do is to make the cars so compelling that even with lower gas prices, it's still the car you want to buy,' said Musk.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3423245/Elon-Musk-building-two-affordable-30-000-electric-cars-Tesla-confirms-sedan-crossover-coming.html"}
