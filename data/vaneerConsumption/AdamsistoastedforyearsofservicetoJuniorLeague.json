Britt Skarda gave the benediction. Billie Rutherford, Sharon Bale and Georgia Mjartan all said a few words about Adams. The luncheon began with league president Marisha DiCarlo's notes on the year.\nAdams framed her acceptance speech as a letter to her parents. \"I think you would love knowing that at least a little of what you tried to instill in me was working. I remember what you always said and how you certainly lived it -- 'Give off the top, not just what's left.'\"\n-- Story and photos by Bobby Ampezzan\nHigh Profile on 05/08/2016","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/may/08/adams-is-toasted-for-years-of-service-t/"}
