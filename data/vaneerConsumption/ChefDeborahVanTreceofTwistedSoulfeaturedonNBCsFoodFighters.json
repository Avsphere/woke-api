In this culinary competition series, Chef VanTrece, along with several other professionals, will compete against a home cook. To level the playing field, none of the chefs will have advance knowledge of what to prepare; they will discover it on-site. The completed dishes will then be sampled in a blind taste test by culinary judges known as “The Dinner Party.” After the two competing dishes are tested, the verdict determining the winner is given to the host.\nFor some chefs, the challenge will be a piece of cake.\nFans can enjoy VanTrece’s inspired soul food menu, indulge in $5 drink specials, complimentary bar hors d'oeuvres and watch “Food Fighters” every Thursday from 8-9 p.m. at her restaurant.\nTwisted Soul Kitchen & Bar is located at 314 East Howard Ave. in Decatur. The “Georgia Voice” named it “Best New Restaurant in Atlanta” this year.\nMore from the press\n“Food Fighters” features a line-up of celebrity chefs and the introduction of kids as contestants for the first time in this second season. It’s the perfect recipe for the ultimate food battle when the best amateur cooks in America put their signature dishes to the test against five professional chefs, with the chance to win as much as $100,000. Television personality, author and food enthusiast Adam Richman (“Man Finds Food,” “Fandemonium”) hosts the series that takes culinary sparring to an exciting new level.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/atlanta-restaurants/chef-deborah-vantrece-twisted-soul-featured-nbc-food-fighters-tonight/UwCtImsIfkXE7jvWUmjkiO/"}
