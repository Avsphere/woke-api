BT haven't replied to me, so why should I reply?'\nEarl's only son who was caught drink driving The Earl's only son and current heir to the estate is Viscount Thomas Stafford St Cyres who made headlines in 2009 when he was caught drink driving for the second time after boasting about his binge drinking habits online. Son: Viscount Thomas Stafford St Cyres Now 32, the young aristocrat posted dozens of pictures of himself on social networking sites with captions including 'Drunk as a Lord'. St Cyres posted on his Bebo page drinking lager, wine and champagne in numerous photographs. He labelled his social networking site 'Self-indulgence is not a crime', talked about 'debauchery' and added 'Still drinking too much gin, but then again what's new?' Another image showed him in a brightly striped jacket holding a pint of lager with the comment: 'Lovely blazer, shame about the chap wearing it!' Under another grinning picture he wrote: 'I fail to remember when this was taken (at which point during dins). I look fairly sloshed so must be late on... Or is that how I look most of the time?!' St Cyres, a classics graduate, was banned from the road for three years.\nA spokesman for the Earl said he was not against bringing broadband to Upton Pyne, but preferred the cables to be buried because telegraph poles would have to cross an 'unspoilt valley'.\nCouncillor Bob Short of Upton Pyne and Cowley Parish Council said: 'In the interests of keeping the countryside looking pretty for everybody, nobody wants poles.\n'But it's the case that they'd not be the only ones in the area, there are poles everywhere. Surely four more isn't going to be too much of an inconvenience for the countryside?'\nOther villagers said the broadband was desperately needed.\nOne, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's an absolute disgrace. We suffer from really bad broadband here and someone who has power from a medieval land grab.\n'It is a ridiculous situation.'\nAnother local added: 'The internet is so slow my son can't do his homework if I go on too. It's very, very frustrating.\n'We've got lots of poles around here - will four more matter?'\nJohn Howells, 38, who works from home as a photographer and artist, said: 'When I want to load images, it's very, very slow.\n'If it gets very desperate I have to drive to my girlfriend's in the countryside - and that's 25 miles away.'\nAnd Fabian King added: 'We've got the cabinet here and we've got the fibre optic cable on the poles. There's one gap of four poles, that's all we need to sew it up.'\nThe family residence was historically Pynes House, a 70 room 21,000 sq ft rural palace similar to Downton Abbey where the clocks mysteriously stopped in 1939.\nThe 2nd Earl of Iddesleigh once claimed the house was the inspiration for Barton Park, which features in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility.\nBut several decades ago, the 4th Earl of Iddesleigh parted with his ancestral pile and moved to a smaller house nearby where his widow still lives - Shillands House near Exeter.\nThe current 5th Earl lives in Newton St Cyres in a Grade II-listed farmhouse built in the late 18th or early 19th century.\nA representative of the Earl said: 'My client is not objecting to broadband, nor has he formally objected to the poles.\n'There is information outstanding by BT, but his preference is for the cables to go underground so there is no further spoiling of the area. I will represent him at the meeting next month when the issue will be discussed.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447464/Earl-sparks-fury-Devon-village-broadband-row.html"}
