Electoral law has been broken and Conservative central office must be investigated by the police. — Pete Wishart (@PeteWishart) March 16, 2017\nI reported Conservative central office to the police about this last year. Now imperative that it is properly investigated. — Pete Wishart (@PeteWishart) March 16, 2017\nThey include Craig Mackinlay, who successfully saw off the challenge of former Ukip leader Nigel Farage in South Thanet, as well as MPs visited by the party’s controversial Battlebus2015 tour.\nSimon Day, who was party treasurer until April last year and who signed off the party’s expenses declaration, has been referred by the commission to the Metropolitan Police.\nHe could face charges under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act if he is judged to have “knowingly or recklessly” made a false declaration that the party’s election spending return was complete and correct.\nCraig Mackinlay's South Thanet seat was one of the seats investigated by the Commission\nThe commission’s findings will alarm Conservative MPs who have already faced police questioning over their individual declarations.\nAt least 12 forces are known to have submitted files to the Crown Prosecution Service with a view to possible criminal action.\nIt comes with the Tories under pressure on numerous fronts, including a dramatic U-turn on Budget tax rises, the Scottish Government’s demands for a second independence referendum, and as Theresa May prepares to trigger Brexit by the end of the month.\nTory election expenses scandal is nothing to do with admin mistakes. Everyone in politics, at this level, knows the limits & how it works. — Simon Danczuk (@SimonDanczuk) March 16, 2017\nThe Prime Minister said the party would pay the fine imposed by the commission. “We have complied fully with the Electoral Commission throughout their investigation,” she told ITV News.\nBut the tensions within the Tory ranks were underlined when party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin reportedly tried to knock the mobile phone from the hand of a Sky News journalist as he tried to film him outside the Houses of Parliament.\nAltogether, the commission found payments worth at least £104,765 were missing from the party’s general election expenses declaration while payments worth up to £118,124 were either incorrectly reported or not reported at all.\nThe investigation was launched following allegations the Tories had incorrectly recorded spending on a \"battle bus\" tour\nThey included spending of £63,486.83 which the party failed to report in relation to the Battlebus2015 tour which bussed activists into around 30 key target seats in the final weeks of the campaign.\nA Conservative Party spokesman said both Labour and the Liberal Democrats also had been fined in relation to their general election expenses, with the Lib Dems facing a police investigation.\n“This is the first time the Conservative Party has been fined for a reporting error. We regret that and will continue to keep our internal processes under review to ensure this does not happen again,” the spokesman said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4319138/Tories-fined-70-000-failing-accurately-report-election-expenses.html"}
