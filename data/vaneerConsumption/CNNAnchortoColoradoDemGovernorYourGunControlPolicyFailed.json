But those checks did not prevent the shooting in Colorado Springs.\nBreitbart News previously reported that Hickenlooper (D) signed multiple gun controls into law in reaction to the July 2012 Aurora theater attack and the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. Among the laws signed were expanded background checks, a ban on “high capacity” ammunition magazines, and new rules on how long a gun can be out of the owner’s possession before another background check is required for him or her to get it back.\nDuring his appearance on State of the Union, Hickenlooper tried to hedge in these controls by pointing to the high number of concealed carry permit holders in Colorado Springs. He said:\nYou know, in Colorado, we passed universal background checks. But at the same time, Colorado Springs is one of the more conservative parts of the state, and we probably have more people who have licenses for concealed weapons—probably more guns around—[but] that didn’t help. I think as a state, but as a country, we’ve got a lot more thinking about this—about how to keep guns out of the hands of people who are unstable.\nKeilar responded, “You’re saying those efforts that you helped spearhead obviously didn’t prevent [the Planned Parenthood shooting.”\nKeilar then pointed out that although gun control did not work, President Obama responded to Friday’s attack by calling for more gun control.\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
