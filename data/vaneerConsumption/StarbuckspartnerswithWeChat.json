WeChat is massive for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, but lags behind rival Alipay in-store. This is likely why the the company has added a popular retailer like Starbucks to its portfolio of stores that accept WeChat Pay, joining KFC, Disney and Uniqlo. On top of partnering with a popular brand, WeChat is also adding a feature that has been successful in the past.\nIn China, it's traditional for individuals to send red envelopes of money to friends and family for the Chinese New Year. WeChat saw over 8.1 billion digital red envelopes sent this year alone. It's likely the social app could increase payments volume on its mobile wallet by leveraging interest in social gifting, and partnering with a retailer that now accepts WeChat Pay.\nThe U.S. payments ecosystem is in the midst of a shift toward mobile, and countless new and old stakeholders are attempting to accelerate this migration, which is moving at a glacial pace relative to other markets globally. But mobile payments can rise to the mainstream. For companies seeking to build out a robust mobile payments product, China's thriving mobile payments ecosystem offers some insight â€” and some lessons.\nTotal mobile payments volume in China will reach $6.3 trillion by 2020, according to our estimates based on iResearch data. This marks a healthy 33% five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). In comparison, the U.S. will generate $154 billion in mobile payments volume this year by our estimates, which amounts to just 6.5% of China's mobile payments volume.\nEven accounting for population discrepancies, China will generate over $1,700 in mobile payments volume per capita in 2016, compared with $475 in the U.S., based on forecasts from BI Intelligence and eMarketer. China's advantage will eventually diminish, but it will still produce around twice as much volume per capita in 2020.\nChina has unique factors buoying the industry, like the dominance of mobile phones, a lack of legacy infrastructure, and the surging popularity of digital retail marketplaces. Some of the characteristics behind the country's success can be mimicked, or even replicated to some extent, in other markets like the U.S. However, one fundamental barrier in the U.S. is that it's being forced to layer mobile payments on top of an existing payments system, and the ecosystem is very fragmented.\nBI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments in China that takes a deep dive into China's mobile payments ecosystem and deciphers which growth drivers can be exported to the U.S. to help spark its relatively lackluster market.\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\nChina claims the world's largest mobile payments market and serves as the global benchmark for other markets to pursue.China will process a whopping $6.3 trillion in total mobile payments by 2020, according to our estimates based on iResearch data.
