It is listed by the 2000 IUCN Red List as \"Lower Risk—Conservation Dependent\" and on the African Wildlife Foundation \"Least Threatened\" list, and not on the list for CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\nWildebeest are not sought after by poachers and even the tracking of their herds is unlikely to expose other wildlife that interact with the herds, Verhoef said.\n\"Lions and other predators are territorial creatures. They roam freely within their territorial areas and do not 'follow the herd' per se. There is no way that HerdTracker could ever reveal the location of lions or any other animals in a way that would be to the benefit of poachers,\" he said.\n\"HerdTracker's GPS updates do not single out individual animals (as was the case of the Rhino and the Bengal Tiger). HerdTracker GPS updates plot the approximate position of the entire herd. Usually the epicentre of the largest herd, which can consist of hundreds of thousands of animals. There are dozens of subherds that make-up the mega-herd that is the migration.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/searching-wildebeest-theres-app-n104211"}
