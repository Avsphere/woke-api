The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nMILWAUKEE — Wisconsin's tough laws requiring children be charged as adults in homicide cases could mean a 12-year-old girl accused of stabbing a friend won't get help she needs, her attorney said Tuesday.\nWaukesha County prosecutors have charged two 12-year-old girls in adult court with stabbing a friend the same age nearly to death in the woods. The girls allegedly told detectives they conspired for months to kill the other girl in hopes of pleasing Slenderman, a bogeyman character they read about online.\nEach girl faces one count of first-degree \"attempted homicide with a knife enhancer\" and could get up to 65 years in the state prison system.\nIn Wisconsin, anyone 10 or older charged with homicide is automatically considered an adult. Four states have the next youngest threshold for that, at 13.\nAnthony Cotton, an attorney for one of the girls, said he believed the two may be the youngest ever charged as adults in the county.\nHe said he plans to push to get his client transferred to juvenile court, where he said she can get help. The state's juvenile system is geared toward rehabilitation rather than punishment; offenders can be held only until they're 25 years old.\n\"She's 12 and she has mental health issues,\" Cotton said of his client. \"There's no question that she needs to go to the hospital.\"\nWaukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel called adult court a starting point for the case and noted that the allegations haven't been proven. But he added that one could argue the girls deserve a harsher punishment than confinement until age 25.\n\"I realize they're only 12,\" said Schimel, who is running for attorney general. \"But so is the victim and she came very close to not seeing her 13th birthday.\"\nAccording to court documents, the girls invited the victim to a sleepover on Friday. They planned to stab her while she slept to become Slenderman's \"proxies,\" Cotton's client told investigators.\nThey planned to run off to Slenderman's mythical forest mansion after the victim was dead.\nThey decided to kill her on Saturday instead. They went into the woods, where one girl pushed the victim down and sat on her. The girls then traded the knife back and forth between them before one of them finally tackled the victim again and began stabbing her, according to the complaint.\nThe girls left the victim lying in the woods. She crawled to a road where a bicyclist found her lying on the sidewalk. Police arrived and she gave them the name of one of the girls who attacked her.\nCotton said he didn't know if the allegations were true but if they were his client would have started plotting the attack when she was only 11. She needs help, not prison, he said.\nCotton said he plans to have a doctor evaluate the girl and present the findings to prosecutors in hopes they wouldn't oppose moving her into juvenile court. He then plans to present those findings to a judge, although he said it could be months before a decision comes.\nHis client told a detective she regretted the incident. The other girl told detectives they both stabbed the victim. At one point that girl said she was sorry.\nThe other girl's attorney, public defender Joseph Smith, Jr., didn't return a telephone message.\n— The Associated Press","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawyer-pushing-juvenile-court-12-year-old-stabbing-suspect-n121871"}
