All times local.\n10:30 a.m.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is continuing his attacks on Fox News host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly.\nThe GOP front-runner posted seductive photos of her from a 2010 GQ Magazine shoot on his official Twitter page and referred to her as \"the bimbo that's asking presidential questions.\"\nTrump's Fox feud dates back to the first primary debate, when Kelly took him to task over derogatory statements he'd made about women.\nTrump announced this week that he would boycott Thursday's Fox debate following a mocking Fox News statement that suggested Trump would replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers and that the leaders of Iran and Russia \"both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly\" if he becomes president.\nHe accused Kelly of being \"a lightweight\" and says he will instead host a fundraiser for wounded veterans instead of attending the debate.\n___\n10:20 a.m.\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson received a standing ovation from Iowa lawmakers during a visit to the state Capitol.\nCarson spent time in the House chamber Thursday morning. He sat alongside Rep. Rob Taylor, a Republican from West Des Moines who is co-chair of Carson's campaign in Iowa.\nCarson did not make public remarks but received a standing ovation from lawmakers in the chamber when Taylor introduced him. He later met privately with Republican lawmakers.\nCarson is one of several presidential candidates traveling around Iowa ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucuses on Monday. He will participate in a Fox News GOP debate Thursday night in Des Moines.\n___\n10:00 a.m.\nA new $1 million political advertisement says that Donald Trump can't be trusted, even on his signature issue of getting tough on illegal immigrants.\nThe ad seeks to undermine the frequent Republican presidential poll leader's tough talk about building a wall on the Mexican border.\nIt includes comments he has made about giving \"amnesty\" to some who are in the country illegally. And it goes on to assert that his real estate development company relies on illegal immigrants for cheap labor, pointing out a $1 million fine the Trump Organization paid for employing illegal immigrants in the construction of the Trump Tower in New York.\nRepresentatives of Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421162/The-Latest-New-ad-criticizes-Trumps-record-amnesty.html"}
