Don't go see the movies that don't have your representation. That's the boycott you want,' she continued. 'To me, we have this conversation every year. It p*sses me off.'\nThe 60-year-old - who has hosted the show four times - also pointed another flaw in the Academy discrimination argument: The person who won the 1991 Best Supporting Actress for her role in Ghost was black.\n'I won once,' she said. 'So it can't be that racist.'\nPharrell, The Weeknd and Lady Gaga - who are all nominated for Best Original Song - will also each perform on the night.\nWriting's on the wall: Nine-year-old Jacob Tremblay is set to melt hearts again, while Sam Smith is the third of the dual performer/presenters","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/usshowbiz/article-3421473/Hart-Del-Toro-Goldberg-Oscar-presenters.html"}
