However, I recently had lunch at Jim ‘N Nick’s in Smyrna and their eggs were delicious — so much better than mine! Do you think they would share the recipe? I would really appreciate it. Thank you. — Martha Knight, Sandy Springs\nPaul Bestafka, local owner of the Jim ‘N Nick’s location in Smyrna as well as in Hiram, and the Nick’s in Acworth, was happy to share the recipe for their delicious deviled eggs. It’s full of classic deviled egg seasonings but maybe the secret is in how carefully those seasonings are prepared.\nThe final touch for the eggs is a sprinkle of Jim ‘N Nick’s Bar-B-Q Dry Rub seasoning. It’s available for sale in the restaurants and online at www.jimnnicks.com.\nIs there a recipe from a metro Atlanta restaurant you’d like to make at home? Tell us and we’ll try to get it.
