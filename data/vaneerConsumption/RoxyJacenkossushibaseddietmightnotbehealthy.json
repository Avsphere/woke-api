You can be lean, fit and nutritionally malnourished, abs are not an indication of how healthy you are.\n'The specific nutrients of concern are calcium and iron. Sushi and sashimi do not provide enough iron to reach the recommended daily intake for women at 14mg daily.\n'You've got a degree in hustle' one fan wrote on Ms Jacenko's most recent #fitspo post\n'When iron is depleted over the long term a person can become anaemic, resulting in extreme fatigue, lack of motivation and hair loss. Similarly, calcium is another nutrient that is very important for women.\n'Although there is calcium in vegetables and green juices, it’s almost impossible to reach recommended diary intakes for health without eating dairy products, or fortified goods or supplementation.\n'The consequences of long term calcium depletion will show up post menopause when hormone estrogen levels decline and your bones are no longer protected. Low calcium intakes are associated with brittle bones resulting osteoporosis in older women,' she said.\nPrinted tights are an outfit staple for Ms Jacenko who rocks the likes of Nimble Activewear, Lorna Jane and PE Nation to the gym\nMs Maston doesn't believe the diet the 36-year-old has adopted is 'healthy'.\n'In younger women reduced energy intakes, low iron and calcium intakes, coupled with heavy training loads can result in the female athlete triad. It’s a condition that’s influenced by the combination of the above factors leading to brittle bones, menstrual disturbances, and fatigue.\n'It’s important that in striving to achieve the ‘ideal’ body through cleaning eating and exercise, that we don’t end up developing disordered eating like orthorexia as a result. Being healthy and feeling good in your body doesn’t mean you have to excessively restrict everything you eat or drop nutritious foods,' she continued.\nMs Jacenko trains every Monday to Friday making sure she leaves her weekends free to relax with her children Pixie, five, and Hunter, two.\nSeeing double: 'I had to start [exercising] for my health as part of radiation treatment [for breast cancer], so it wasn’t an option'\nThree of those days are spent doing weights and resistance training with Dan Adair at the lucrative 98 Riley St gym and the other two days she attends cardio sessions at F45.\n'I do a lot of core work with Dan Adair and push ups. I am also extremely careful what I eat – basically a sushi/sashimi diet and green juices. There’s nothing better than that line down your stomach! Proud!' Ms Jacenko told Body and Soul.\nAnd she's not shy in sharing her workout outfits on Instagram. The incredibly fit 36-year-old director of Sweaty Betty PR has been tagging PE Nation, Lorna Jane and Nimble Activewear in her #fitspo posts with many of her followers asking where she purchases her printed pieces from.\nJaggad tights worn by Ms Jacenko to one of her three weekly strength and resistance based classes\nThe answer? Online sports retailer Stylerunner.\nMs Jacenko said she used to say she was 'too busy' to exercise consistently but once she found a rhythm it became an irrelevant excuse.\n'I had to start [exercising] for my health as part of radiation treatment [for breast cancer], so it wasn’t an option.\n'That said, really, there is no excuse not to be able to fit in 45-60 minutes a day for training when it’s going to be beneficial to your health and well being long-term.\n'I used to have the mentality that I was too busy, but it’s important to put it in perspective,” she said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4318132/Roxy-Jacenko-s-sushi-based-diet-not-healthy.html"}
