We’ll make it up in a double header around Labor day. A lot of people think I’m retiring, and I’ve been kind of telling a fib. I have been forced to leave the job because I gave $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/05/20/letterman-im-being-forced-out-because-i-gave-75k-to-the-clinton-foundation/"}
