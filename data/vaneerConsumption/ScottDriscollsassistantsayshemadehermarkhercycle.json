Driscoll's executive assistant in 2009 when he was chief executive of Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association.\nMs Ellingworth claims Driscoll, who was jailed for fraud on Friday, made inappropriate comments to female members of staff about strip clubs and adult shops â€“ and that women never worked at the QRTSA for very long.\n'I was 20 or 21 and not very political but I just knew he was shady,' she told the Brisbane Times.\nShe said the final straw for her was when she confided in him about suffering from endometriosis and said she may occasionally need to call in sick or work from home if her cramps became too painful.\nShe says Driscoll demanded she mark up his office calendar with the dates she would be menstruating, adding: 'I need to know when you might not be in the office.'\nAmy Ellingworth, a former executive assistant to disgraced MP Scott Driscoll, says he asked her to mark up her menstrual cycle in his office calendar\nMs Ellingworth claims Scott Driscoll (pictured) made inappropriate comments to female members of staff about strip clubs and adult shops\nMs Ellingworth also said that Driscoll instructed her to just 'smile and nod and look as if you are taking minutes' at board meetings.\nShe says he told her he would take care of the notes.\nDriscoll, who was elected to Queensland Parliament in 2012, will spend at least 18 months in jail after using his trusted position at the QRTSA to swindle money and attempt to solicit hundreds-of-thousands in secret commissions.\nIt's unclear exactly how much money he took during his year-long rort of the lobby group.\nBut during his sentencing at the Brisbane District Court on Friday, Judge Deborah Richards said he used fraudulently obtained money to pay about $55,000 to the LNP.\nAnother $57,00 was used to buy a property and about $176,000 was defrauded through the creation of fake documents made while he was the member for Redcliffe, the court heard.\nDriscoll will spend at least 18 months in jail after using his trusted position at the QRTSA to swindle money and attempt to solicit hundreds-of-thousands in secret commissions\n'This position of trust enabled you to continue the fraud offences such that they would go undetected for a period of time,' Judge Richards said.\n'These are very serious offences committed by someone in a significant position of trust.'\nDriscoll stood still in the dock as he was sentenced to a maximum six-years, following his guilty plea three days before he was due to go to trial in November.\nDue to his extensive mental health issues, he will be eligible for parole after 18 months behind bars.\nDriscoll had used QRTSA, the small business lobby group he ran, to funnel money from its members to a company he also ran called Norsefire.\nSome of the funds were then paid to his personal account.\nDue to his extensive mental health issues, he will be eligible for parole after 18 months\nWhen QRTSA received $110,000, it was immediately deposited to Norsefire and a few months later $57,200 was transferred to Driscoll and used as a deposit on a property, Judge Richards said.\nThat month Driscoll also called a Coles government relations representative and introduced himself as the member for Redcliffe.\nHe offered to make a public statement supporting them if they paid $200,000 to $300,000 to the QRTSA.\nHe made Woolworths a similar offer on the same day.\n'This was unauthorised, these representations, and against the instructions of the QRTSA,' Judge Richards said.\nNeither company paid the demanded fee to Driscoll.\nHowever, if the payments had been made, it is unlikely it would have been to QRTSA's benefit, the court heard.\n'The money would, or at least some of the money would, undoubtedly have ended up in the Norsefire account,' Judge Richards said.\nDuring his time ripping off QRTSA and its members several other loans were made to Driscoll.\n'The exact amount used to your benefit is unknown,' Judge Richards said.\nDriscoll also swindled an $18,000 car from QRTSA, which was uncovered during an audit.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4299820/Scott-Driscoll-s-assistant-says-mark-cycle.html"}
