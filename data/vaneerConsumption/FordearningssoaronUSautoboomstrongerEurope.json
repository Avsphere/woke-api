When Ford announced the change on January 7, it said it would boost 2015 pre-tax profit by $1.5 billion.\nEarnings for the fourth quarter were $1.9 billion, up $4.4 billion from the year-ago period. Quarterly profits were 58 cents per share, seven cents above analyst expectations.\nFord confirmed its 2016 forecast for revenue and earnings per share equal or higher to that in 2015.\n\"In 2016, we will continue to build on our strengths and accelerate our pace of progress even further, while transforming Ford into both an auto and a mobility company and creating value for all of our stakeholders,\" said Ford president and chief executive Mark Fields in a statement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3421128/Ford-earnings-US-auto-boom-stronger-Europe.html"}
