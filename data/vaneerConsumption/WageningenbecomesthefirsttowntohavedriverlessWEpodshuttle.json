The event will involve taxiing six passengers along a 655ft (200 metre) stretch of road in the first trial of its kind worldwide. The WEpod, one of a fleet to be rolled out in coming years, will ride in the central Dutch town of Wageningen\nAt 5mph (8km/h), it's not going to set a speed record, 'but an unmanned vehicle has never been used on public roads,' the project's technical director, Jan Willem van der Wiel, said.\nThe WEpod is a self-propelled vehicle without control and without pedals.\nIt runs completely automatically on electricity and inside the shuttle is a six-seater cab with automatic doors and a ramp for wheelchair use.\nWHAT IS THE WEPOD? The WEpod is a self-propelled vehicle without control and without pedals and the vehicle runs completely automatically on electricity. Inside the shuttle is a six-seater cab with automatic doors. It is 9ft tall (2.7 metres) and 6.5ft wide (1.9 metres). The pod's maximum speed is 25mph (40km/h) but when driving on roads its speed will be restricted to 15.5mph (25km/h). The electric drive with a range of about 62 miles (100km).\nThe vehicle is 9ft tall (2.7 metres) and 6.5ft wide (1.9 metres).\nThe pod's maximum speed is 25mph (40km/h) but when driving on roads its speed will be restricted to 15.5mph (25km/h).\nUsing cameras, radar and laser sensors, WEpod collects information about its surroundings.\nOn-board computers combine all data and give commands to the brakes and steering.\nAs a result, the vehicle can respond to other road users and sudden changes.\nAt predetermined points, and if the vehicle is stopped during travel, an operator in a remote 'control room' can check the vehicle and restart it if needed.\nPassengers can also contact the control room from the WEpod.\nSeveral trials of so-called autonomous vehicles are under way in the automotive and technology industries.\nThe vehicle is 9ft tall (2.7 metres) and 6.5ft wide (1.9 metres). The pod's maximum speed is 25mph (40km/h) but when driving on roads its speed will be restricted to 15.5mph (25km/h)\nThe shuttle pilot (passengers pictured) will be expanded in coming months and will eventually be used as public transport along a 4-mile (6km) route\nThese include Tesla's Model S sedan, which can change lanes with minimal driver input, to plans by Google and Daimler to introduce driverless vehicles.\nFord has even tested its own self-driving cars in a variety of conditions, including snow.\n'There are initiatives all over the world, but this is the first time one will operate without a driver, on a public road,' added Iris van Cattenburch of Connekt, a group of companies developing sustainable public transport.\nThe shuttle pilot project will be expanded in coming months and will eventually be used as public transport along a 4-mile (6km) route in the town, she said.\nIn April, the Netherlands will hold the first trial with driverless semi-trucks at Rotterdam port, which autonomous road trains sending cargo from Europe's biggest port, throughout the continent by 2019.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3420837/Driverless-shuttle-bus-Dutch-public-roads-world-first.html"}
