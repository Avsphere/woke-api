To stage at New York Fashion Week. Instead of a presentation or runway show. And with that, all the classic, stuffy notions of a high-class NYFW have officially gone out the window. And to that, I say, good riddance.\nThis partnership between Opening Ceremony and Spike Jonze isn't as unexpected as it might seem at read-through. You can still shop the Her by Opening Ceremony collection on the brand's website (and you should, since the futuristically cool pieces are on major sale right now). The brand also collaborated with the director for his on-screen adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are, so, really, it's about time Jonze returned the creative favor.\nBringing Hill, star of such quality films as Superbad and 21 Jump Street, onto the project was apparently all Jonze's idea, presumably to add some of that silly sense of humor fashion people are so notorious for having (what?) into the script. While I'd certainly love to see him crash around in some fancy clothes, it appears only his writing skills will be put to good use — Hill won't actually be appearing in the one-act.\nThere's no word yet on the plot, but I assume it will be a buddy comedy about a superstylish bro from the future who, in order to win over his high school crush, must craft a bunch of really trendy sweatshirts. And James Franco makes a cameo appearance.\nImages: Angela Weiss, Brad Barket/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35586-spike-jonze-and-jonah-hill-writing-a-one-act-play-for-opening-ceremony-during-fashion-week-and"}
