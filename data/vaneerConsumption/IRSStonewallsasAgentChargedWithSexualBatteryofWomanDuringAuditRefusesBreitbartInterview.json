In a news release, a spokesperson for the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office said the charges are related to an IRS audit that Garza was performing on a Williamson County business. According to an arrest report, Garza showed up at the business and made “sexual overtures,” implying the woman would lose the business if she didn’t cooperate.
