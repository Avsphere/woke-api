Asa Hutchinson fully endorsed the proposal made by Key for a waiver of the state's Teacher Fair Dismissal Act and the Public School Employee Fair Hearing Act in the 22 Little Rock schools, which is the point of sharp contention between the district and the union.\nKey acts as the school board in the state-controlled Little Rock district that has no elected school board.\nHutchinson said the state is constitutionally responsible for ensuring that every child has access to a good education, and that the proposed waiver of the school employment protection laws would help to ensure that in Little Rock.\n\"Whenever you look at a D or F school, that's not fair to the children and its not fair to the parents,\" Hutchinson said. \"We want exceptional schools here in Arkansas and that includes Little Rock. No one should be left behind or left out.\"\nMost of teachers do an incredible job, are dedicated and in big demand, the governor said. The proposed amendment to the 2018-19 professional negotiated agreement would \"make it a little bit easier\" to make a change \"if we have a non-performing teacher -- a bad teacher who is not doing a good job.\"\nHutchinson said the union is arguing for the unacceptable status quo and \"fear mongering\" about the possibility of large scale employee firings.\n\"If you look at teachers across Arkansas, they do a good job and they do a good job in Little Rock school district, he said. \"We want to make sure they are rewarded but it is not fair to the excellent teachers we have to stand beside someone who is not doing a good job, who doesn't show up in the classroom and ... year after year they are non-performing, and nothing is done about that. This gives more flexibility and I think the excellent teachers in Little Rock understand that this is necessary to move the schools in a better direction.\"\nKey on Oct. 22 had rejected a 2018-19 tentative agreement between the district and the Little Rock Education Association. He directed Poore to re-enter negotiations with the union to insert language in which the district and association would both support a waiver of the school employee protection laws in the 22 Little Rock schools -- including three high schools -- that recently received D and F ratings from the state.\nThe school ratings or grades are based on student achievement and academic gains on the 2018 ACT Aspire as well as on factors such as student attendance, high school graduation data, and college entrance exam scores.\nThe Arkansas Board of Education would ultimately have to approve any waiver of the school employee protection laws. It has the legal authority to do that in a Level 5-Intensive Support district, such as Little Rock, because of provisions in Act 930 of 2017, that sets up the state's school accountability system.\nGordon said Monday night that she had told Poore that a lengthier extension of the existing 2017-18 negotiated agreement was necessary to study the proposed waiver of the laws.\n\"I communicated to Mr. Poore that I feel we need to be very careful and more deliberate about this directive and that we really need to consider the ramifications on all employees,\" she said. She said, for example, that state Board of Education waivers typically apply to a whole district and not to specific campuses, as is being proposed.\nThe proposed waiver would eliminate time-consuming requirements for principal observations of teachers and the writing and carrying out of employee improvement plans. Key has said repeatedly -- and again on Monday -- that he expects the proposed waiver to be used like a scalpel to remove ineffective teachers and not a chainsaw, and that there would not be mass firings.\n\"The academic success of nearly 11,000 LRSD students in these schools depends on having all administrative tools available,\" Key said Monday. \"The outstanding teachers, administrators and support staff who come to work every day with the sole focus of helping our students achieve their potential have no reason to worry.\"\nBut Gordon questioned what would happen if Key is replaced.\n\"Somebody else could decide to use it like a chainsaw,\" Gordon said of the waiver if it is put into place. \"We have no guarantees if we agree to that and put it in our contract.\n\"Those laws were fought for a long time ago and were fought for a reason,\" she also said in calling for careful deliberation and research.\nMetro on 10/30/2018","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/oct/30/teachers-pact-given-extension-20181030/"}
