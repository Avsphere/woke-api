Apple dived 6.5 percent in US trade.\nAsian tech supplier share falls came despite a broad pick-up across regional stock markets ©Wang Zhao (AFP/File)\nSamsung sank more than two percent in the morning in Seoul. Among regional suppliers, Tokyo-listed Alps Electric -- which Wednesday cut its profit forecast because of weak smartphone sales -- plunged almost 16 percent. Japan Display lost almost five percent and TDK almost seven percent.\nLG Display in Seoul was 3.7 percent off.\nThe losses came despite a broad pick-up across regional stock markets, despite losses on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve left open the door to another interest rate hike.\nAfter concluding its first meeting since lifting rates in December, the US central bank kept rates unchanged and said growth in the world's number one economy slowed late last year and was concerned about ongoing global weaknesses.\n- Focus on BoJ meeting -\nHowever, despite the turmoil that has wracked world markets so far in 2016, policymakers added that they expected inflation -- softened by falling oil prices -- would rise toward its 2.0 percent target in the medium term. The comment was seen as keeping the Fed's option open for another hike in March.\n\"With investor sentiment quite poor and fixated on the negatives, they'll likely latch onto the Fed's focus over global risks,\" Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management, told Bloomberg News.\n\"However, rather than a hawkish statement, I think we got one that was market friendly. And that should impact stocks over the longer run.\"\nBy lunch Tokyo's Nikkei index was up 0.2 percent, while Hong Kong gained 0.5 percent and Sydney 0.7 percent. Seoul was slightly lower, with Samsung acting as a drag. Shanghai slipped 0.4 percent, with ongoing worries about the domestic economy continuing to play on investors' minds.\nNext up is the Bank of Japan's policy meeting, which concludes Friday. While expectations are that it will not move just yet, its statement will be pored over for an idea about policymakers' thinking as Japan's economy stumbles and local stock markets are jostled by the global rout.\nOn oil markets, both global contracts turned lower with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate down 0.9 percent and Brent 0.8 percent off.\nThey posted gains Wednesday, even after a report showed US stockpiles surged last week. Analysts said the rally was in reaction to the fact the rise was not as big as expected.\n- Key figures around 0230 GMT -\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.2 percent at 17,196.30 (break)\nShanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.4 percent at 2,725.57\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.5 percent at 19,153.52\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.0893 from $1.0892 Wednesday\nDollar/yen: UP at 118.81 yen from 118.67 yen\nNew York - Dow: DOWN 1.4 percent at 15,944.46 (close)\nLondon - FTSE 100: UP 1.3 percent at 5,990.37 (close)\nSamsung Electronics reported a 40 percent on-year drop in fourth-quarter net profit on Thursday ©Jung Yeon-Je (AFP/File)\nApple this week reported the slowest growth sales ever of its iPhone and warned it expects worse to come ©Andrew Burton (GETTY/AFP)","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420293/Samsung-suppliers-sink-smartphone-woes-Asia-stocks-gain.html"}
