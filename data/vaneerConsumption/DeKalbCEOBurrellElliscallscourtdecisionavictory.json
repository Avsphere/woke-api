He already served an eight-month prison sentence.\nA jury found Ellis guilty of trying to shake down a contractor for campaign contributions, but Ellis won his appeal. The court decided that Ellis didn’t receive a fair trial, in part because a judge didn’t allow him to solicit testimony from county contractors who didn’t feel pressured to make political donations.\nThe charges against Ellis haven’t been dismissed, and incoming DeKalb District Attorney Sherry Boston will have to decide whether to move forward with the case.\nPlease read the full story on MyAJC.com.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/dekalb-ceo-burrell-ellis-calls-court-decision-victory/KjJM4AEvHk3NbSUoN29KEI/"}
