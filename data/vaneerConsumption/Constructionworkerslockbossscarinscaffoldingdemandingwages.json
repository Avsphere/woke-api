Enforcement of laws to protect the group is also relatively weak.\nIt is unclear if the extreme clamping method by the employees at the Shangrao Economic Development Zone was successful.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3420841/The-ultimate-car-clamp-Angry-construction-workers-lock-boss-s-car-scaffolding-demand-owed-salaries.html"}
