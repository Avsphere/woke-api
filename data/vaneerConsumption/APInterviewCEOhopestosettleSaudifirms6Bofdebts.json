As financial markets tightened during the Great Recession, the company began defaulting on those loans. It quickly spiraled, becoming one of the largest corporate defaults in Mideast history.\nThe firm's founding al-Gosaibi family responded by alleging that Maan al-Sanea, who married into the family and worked in AHAB, had issued a series of fake loans. Al-Sanea, once described as a billionaire by Forbes magazine and who formerly held a significant portion of stock in HSBC bank, has long denied the allegations. A string of lawsuits against al-Sanea and his interests around the world followed.\nAHAB has been working to find a way to bring all its creditors into agreement about how to settle the outstanding debt.\nUnder the current deal, AHAB would guarantee repaying debts \"25 to 30 cents\" on the dollar based on its assets, Charlton said. Based on the company's outstanding debts, the payout could be as much as $1.8 billion.\nHe said the company hoped that its lawsuits, if successful, would boost that payout to \"40 to 60 cents on the dollar.\"\nIf a majority of creditors agree, Charlton said he hoped AHAB would present the proposed plan to a Saudi enforcement court before the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan begins in July. However, he stressed Thursday that creditors had yet to formally agree on the proposal, though many seemed to be warming to the idea.\nThe settlement proposal comes as Saudi Arabia's budget is squeezed by low oil prices. The kingdom is considering offering shares of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world's largest oil producer, to the public.\nAn AHAB settlement would send a \"good message to international markets and international investors,\" Charlton said. \"I think it will give people a lot of comfort if they know ... (there's) a system and a process that's fair and equal.\"\n___","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420944/AP-Interview-CEO-hopes-settle-Saudi-firms-6B-debts.html"}
