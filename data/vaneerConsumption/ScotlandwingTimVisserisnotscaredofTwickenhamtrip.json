We need to play the game not the occasion that is why we have to treat this as just another game of rugby.\n“We are going to where they say is a daunting place but we are looking forward to it. The last couple of weeks we have played exciting rugby.\n“England know how to win games but I don’t think they’ve been winning as smoothly as they always have. They have struggled up to half time in various games. But they must be doing something right to have won 17 games in a row.\nScotland's Tim Visser\n“But I don´t think we are a team under pressure. We go down there with a record of not much success but we have kept our feet on the ground. We have to give it our best but I think the pressure is on them.”\nScotland have put themselves in rare contention to land the RBS 6 Nations title following wins over Ireland and Wales. And Visser admits there is more than just national pride riding on this edition of the annual Calcutta Cup duel.\n“I would be lying if I said there wasn’t,” he said. “We all know the importance of it with one eye on the championship.\n“At this level it is all about keeping a calm head. We showed that against Ireland and Wales when we won in the later stages of the game. It is going to be a tight game. If we want to be in it we still have to be in with a shout at half time.\n“England have won championships but we have shown we can win tight games. All we have to do now is do it at Twickenham.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4300610/Scotland-wing-Tim-Visser-not-scared-Twickenham-trip.html"}
