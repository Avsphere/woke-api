And if we don’t respect where they’re coming from and be willing to engage in dialogue and debate based on that level, then we’re no better than the racists that we’re decrying right now. We have a responsibility to be that way.”\n“No, that’s not true. We are still better than the racists. But you’re right. It is a lowering of kind of decent standards because many of the voters were also just people susceptible to low-quality information,” Kellerman replied.\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/12/09/espns-kellerman-many-trump-voters-susceptible-low-quality-information/"}
