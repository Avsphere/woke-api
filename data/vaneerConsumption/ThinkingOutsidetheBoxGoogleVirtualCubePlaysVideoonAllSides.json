In terms of filmmaking, it was a challenge as unique as the canvas itself. “The main challenge is that you’re not just telling one story. You’re telling six stories,” Ayson says. Ultimately, they settled on a loosely connected series of sequences based on the seven main story types–comedy, tragedy, rags-to-riches and so on–with characters moving seamlessly between the different scenes of the cube’s faces.\nThe idea for the project was born last year at the Google Creative Lab in Sydney. From the start, the team saw it as an experiment in both technology and storytelling. “At Google, what’s exciting to us about the cube is that it’s really exploring different ways of approaching film,” says Jonathan Richards, a creative lead at the studio. “We’ve been quite accustomed to film being a little rectangle on the web which you could play and experience the director’s vision. But what would it be like if you handed the editing experience over to the audience and said, ‘You’re going to create the path through this film. You’re going to decide the narrative structure.’”\nThe ultimate aim is to make the cube available as a sort of sandbox for creators. In coming months, Google plans to release an embeddable version of the player, in addition to a smartphone app which would let viewers prod the cube as scenes played out. Tom Uglow, a creative director at Google’s Sydney studio, hopes that the experimental canvas might be of interest not just to artists but perhaps to people like educators and journalists, too.\n“There are so many places you can go,” he says. “We show it to creative people, and they all want to take it to their own place.”\n— Kyle Vanhemert, Wired\nMore from Wired:\n30 Years After Chernobyl's Meltdown, Gripping Photos Expose the Human Fallout\nThe Mystery of Go, the Ancient Game That Computers Still Can’t Win\nInstagram Finally Unveils New and Improved Photo Filters\nThe Eerie, Crumbling Bunkers of the Nazis’ Atlantic Wall","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/gift-guide/thinking-outside-box-google-virtual-cube-plays-video-all-sides-n121631"}
