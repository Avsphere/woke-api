The cross, originally a 19th-century German military medal, was once used by the Nazis and is sometimes still displayed as a hate symbol, although it can have other meanings\nThe strongman (pictured), 48, killed himself Wednesday morning after being pulled over by the FBI in Haverstraw, New York, sources said\nPhotos taken in front of Benderoth's home in Stony Point, New York, reveal racist black-faced statues on the stoop, such as this 'lawn jockey' in a red jacket and white pants\n'He stayed there for three days putting body parts together on the sidewalk,' John Livesay told the New York Daily News. 'I don't think you can see that and come away normal.'\nThe depression ultimately prompted Benderoth to leave his job at the NYPD in 2004 to work at the Haverstraw police department instead, another friend said.\n'The last time I talked with him, a year ago, he was not good. He suffered from 9/11 related depression,' sportswriter Albert Thompson Thompson said. 'He went to the Haverstraw Police Department because of the trauma. He couldn't be a cop in New York.'\nBenderoth retired last year. He and his wife Amy also owed $349,901 to Citizens Bank in mortgage payment, according to court records obtained by the newspaper. The couple lived in Stony Point, New York with their four children.\nPhotos taken outside the home have revealed that the former cop kept racist lawn ornaments on the stoop.\nOne of the four black-faced statues, pictured by the New York Post, depicts a caricatured black person carrying a slice of watermelon. Another one shows a shoeshine boy and the other two are 'lawn jockeys' wearing white pants and red vests.\nSome have tried to defend the lawn jockeys saying they were actually an homage to an African-American soldier who froze to death during the Revolutionary War, but historians have found no evidence of that account.\nA friend of Benderoth's, however, told the New York Post there 'wasn't a racist bone' in the former cop's body, adding: 'He was just a guy that would stop and help anyone.'\nAn Instagram photo shows Benderoth shirtless, revealing an Iron Cross tattoo on his chest. The Iron Cross, originally a 19th-century German military medal once used by the Nazis, is sometimes still displayed as a hate symbol, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which noted that the cross on its own could have other meanings.\nLaw enforcement sources cited Benderoth's close friendship with former Westchester County officer Nicholas Tartaglione (pictured), who was accused of a quadruple murder in December\nAmong the four men Tartaglione is accused of killing are Urbano Santiago (left) and Hector Gutierrez (right). Authorities said they dug up their bodies on the former cop's property\nTartaglione has also been charged with the murders of Miguel Sosa-Luna (left) and Martin Santos-Luna (right). The former cop is also accused of participating in a conspiracy to distribute 5 kilograms and more of cocaine\nBenderoth was stopped in Haverstraw around 8:20am Wednesday and shot and killed himself as officials approached his vehicle, the North Rockland Daily Voice reported previously.\nLaw enforcement sources cited Benderoth's close friendship with Tartaglione, a former Briarcliff Manor officer who was accused of a quadruple murder in December last year.\nThe avid weightlifter decided he wanted to be 'big and strong' aged 13 after watching Conan The Barbarian.\nAuthorities didn't confirm why Benderoth had been pulled over but told the North Rockland Daily Voice about his relationship with Tartaglione, who is accused of killing four people in a drug deal gone wrong.\nTartaglione, a fellow weightlifter, was arrested and charged in December after authorities said they had dug up four bodies on his property.\nThe former cop has been charged by US Attorney Preet Bharara's office with participation in a conspiracy to distribute five kilograms and more of cocaine and the 'senseless murders' of four men.\nTartaglione was previously involved in a feud with TV host Clay Tiffany, who accused the ex-officer of assaulting him before earning a $1 million settlement, News 12 reported at the time.\nIt is unclear how Benderoth might have been connected to the case. The FBI declined to identify the strongman but confirmed to the New York Post that someone had committed suicide after being stopped.\nHis death occurred on a residential street, not far from an elementary school.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4299670/Ex-cop-9-11-related-depression-suicide.html"}
