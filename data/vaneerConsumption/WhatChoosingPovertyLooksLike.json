Using scrap wood, he spent $75 to build it; most of that paid for fasteners and sealants. The living space is eight feet across and shaped like a circle with a four-feet-high sloped ceiling. \"The things I need are food, clothing, shelter,\" said Price, who lives on about $5,000 a year. Adopting a life of radical simplicity, he said, \"stopped all of my worrying about money and jobs.\"\nNBC News","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/photo/what-choosing-poverty-looks-n75796"}
