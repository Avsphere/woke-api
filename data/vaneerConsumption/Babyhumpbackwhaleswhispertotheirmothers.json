The quiet communication reduces the chances of being overheard by killer whales and sexually rampant male humpbacks looking for an opportunity to mate. The findings highlight the importance of keeping humpback 'nursery' waters as quiet as possible say the scientists.\n'We heard a lot of rubbing sounds, like two balloons being rubbed together, which we think was the calf nudging its mother when it wants to nurse', said Dr Simone Videsen, from the University of Aarhus in Denmark, who led the research in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia.\n'Killer whales hunt young humpback calves outside Exmouth Gulf, so by calling softly to its mother, the calf is less likely to be heard by killer whales, and avoid attracting male humpbacks who want to mate with the nursing females.'\nThe findings highlight the importance of keeping humpback 'nursery' waters as quiet as possible, say the scientists, whose findings appear in the journal Functional Ecology.\n'The calls that we recorded from the mother-calf pairs varied a lot, there were two main groups of call types, grunting sounds that sound like grunts and tonal sounds that sound more squeaky', Dr Videsen told MailOnline.\n'The calls varied from calf to calf within those two categories', she said.\n'Because mother and calf communicate in whispers, shipping noise could easily mask these quiet calls.'\nThe team tagged eight humpback calves and two mothers with suction cup devices that recorded both their sounds and movements\nHUMPBACK WHALES The huge mammals grow up to 16 metres (52 feet) in length. They weigh approximately 36,000 kg (79,000 lbs). Despite their intimidating size, humpback whales are harmless to humans. They mostly eat krill and small fish. During the winter months, humpback whales leave the icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and migrate past the UK to warmer locations. They are rarely seen in large groups, preferring to travel and hunt alone, in pairs, or as small groups that quickly disband.\nThe team tagged eight humpback calves and two mothers with suction cup devices that recorded both their sounds and movements.\nThe tags recorded their communication for up to 48 hours before detaching and floating to the surface.\nThere are two major humpback whale populations - one in the northern hemisphere and the other in the south.\nBoth breed in the tropics during winter and then migrate thousands of miles to their summer feeding grounds in the Arctic and Antarctic.\n'We know next to nothing about the early life stages of whales in the wild, but they are crucial for the calves' survival during the long migration to their feeding grounds', said Dr Videsen.\n'This migration is very demanding for young calves. They travel 5,000 miles across open water in rough seas and with strong winds.\n'Knowing more about their suckling will help us understand what could disrupt this critical behaviour, so we can target conservation efforts more effectively.'\nDuring the winter months, humpback whales leave the icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and migrate to warmer locations.

Pregnancy lasts for around one year and calves – which are five metres at birth – stay with their mothers until they are one year old.\nDuring their first weeks of life, calves can grow by up to one metre per month.\nThis diagram shows the dive profiles for eight tagged calves.
