In an email leaked to the BBC, a serving Royal Navy officer wrote that ‘total electric failures are common’ in the fleet.\nTHE SIX £1BN ROYAL NAVY SHIPS ALL NEEDING NEW ENGINES HMS Daring HMS Dauntless HMS Diamond HMS Defender HMS Dragon HMS Duncan\nA defence source said: ‘It happened with enough frequency that it was decided something needed to be done. But it won’t affect operations and whilst the refit sounds dramatic it is not unusual.’\nCutting into the side of the ship is a normal way to access the engine rooms, the source added.\nIn 2014, HMS Dauntless had to abandon a training exercise and in 2009 HMS Daring lost power in the Atlantic on her first voyage to the US.\nEach of the ships, which are described as 'part of the backbone of the Royal Navy', are fitted with two engines - a gas turbine and a diesel generator.\nA Royal Navy source said the most likely action will be to add as many as two generators to 'bolster the power that's already there'.\nHe accepted that carrying out such maintenance just a few years into the ships' service was not 'normal'.\nHe said: 'It is an issue, we're managing it at the moment but we need to do something about it.'\nPower: The Type 45 destroyers have been branded the world's most advanced small warships but have power problems\nAdmiral Lord West, a former First Sea Lord, said the development was ‘very worrying’, and added that the MoD must have known ‘three or four years ago’ that the destroyers had problems.\nThe ex-Labour security minister said: ‘If there’s a war suddenly, we’ve got six ships you can’t rely on totally in a very hot situation.’\nThe work will be staggered over a period of years so some ships remain available for operational commitments at all times.\nThe MoD has not disclosed the cost of the work but it is thought that it could run to tens of millions of pounds.\nAn MoD spokesman said: 'The Type 45 destroyers are hugely capable ships and have consistently made a difference to our safety and security.\n'In our defence review last year we committed to improving the Type 45's power and propulsion system through a series of machinery upgrades during planned maintenance, which will ensure increased availability and resilience over the life of the ships.'\nThe destroyers are used in 'hunting pirates, drug runners or submarines, defending the fleet from air attack, and providing humanitarian aid after natural disasters', the MoD said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422476/Six-Britain-s-newest-warships-worth-1bn-need-new-engines-breaking-down.html"}
