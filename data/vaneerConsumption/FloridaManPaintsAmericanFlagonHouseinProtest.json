Bradenton Mayor Wayne Poston did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA code enforcement hearing is set for June 17 at which Greer said he could be fined $250 a day.\nGreer, who runs a landscaping business and acknowledges the 110-year-old home is not in perfect repair, said he made some corrections but disputes other parts of the citation.\n\"There are no safety issues at my house. None. Zero,\" Greer said.\nThe Bradenton Herald described the house as one of the few old residences along the Manatee River built before a boom in multi-million homes.\nGreer said his wife Catherine, who holds an art degree, and their seven children repainted the house in red, white and blue, complete with stars.\nHe said the family has received an outpouring of support, particularly among veterans. He said they intend to further decorate the house with a painted plywood Liberty Bell which they will place where the Christmas tree had stood.\n\"It's in compliance,\" Greer said.\nâ€” Reuters","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-man-paints-american-flag-house-protest-n125446"}
