He’s graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand,” the actor said in 2014, immediately following the win for Best Actor for his role in Dallas Buyers Club.\n“He has shown me that it’s a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates,” McConaughey continued. “In the words of the late (British actor) Charlie Laughton, who said, ‘When you got God you got a friend and that friend is you.'”\nWhile faith certainly wasn’t a focal point for most attendees on Sunday, it is safe to say stars were busy championing other noble causes, including ALS, Alzheimer’s, civil rights, equal pay for women, and suicide prevention.\nWhile some of those calls to action touched hearts and drew applause, it is likely a gutter-joke made by Sean Penn that will go down as this year’s most memorable moment, and it came at the end of the show.\nAs Penn presented the award for Best Picture to Alejandro González Iñárritu for Birdman, the liberal icon said, “Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?”\nIn a demonstration of the duality of Hollywood, Penn received a great deal of laughter for the quip, while last year, McConaughey was met with mostly silence.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/02/23/oscar-speeches-racist-jokes-demonstrate-hollywoods-religious-intolerance/"}
