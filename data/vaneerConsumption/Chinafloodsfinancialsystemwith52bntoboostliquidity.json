People also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period.\nThe PBoC last week flooded the financial system with more than 1.5 trillion yuan.\nSome analysts say the recent cash injections are a replacement for monetary easing as the PBoC has become reluctant to cut reserve requirement ratios -- the proportion of money banks must put aside -- on worries over the impact on China's yuan currency, which has been weakening.\nChina's economy grew at its slowest rate in a quarter of a century in 2015, at 6.9 percent, raising expectations for further cuts in interest rates or reserve requirements.\n\"The huge amount of open-market injections are targeting the pre-holiday cash demand,\" Liu Changjiang, a Shanghai-based bond analyst at Soochow Securities, told Bloomberg.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420404/China-floods-financial-52-bn-boost-liquidity.html"}
