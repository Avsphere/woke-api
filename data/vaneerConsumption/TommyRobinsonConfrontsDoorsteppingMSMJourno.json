You got kids?” asks Robinson.\n“I have got kids, yeah,” the journalist replies.\n“Shall I come with a camera to where you are… Shall I come outside your child’s school? Would it be fair?”, Robinson said — making it clear that be believed doing such things was not morally acceptable.\nTommy Robinson: I Was Kept in Solitary Confinement 23.5 Hours a Day, Excrement Pushed Through Windows https://t.co/FWaz9cJOEW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018\n“Look, you’re a high-profile person, I’m not a high-profile person,” the journalist answered, with little clear conviction.\nReplying, Robinson said: “No, you’re a lying journalist. You’re a lying journalist with no conscience.”\nThe journalist continues to insist he should not be ambushed in the same way as Robinson because he is “not high-profile”, but Robinson is unimpressed.\n“You are now mate, you are high-profile now… You’re going to be under the public eye for the hundreds of thousands of people who watch this, yeah, so is it going to be OK for me to come to your house, and your Mum’s house… I’ll do to you what you’ve done to me. Is that going to be fair?”\n“No,” he replies dejectedly — but continues to insist it is different because he is not a “divisive figure”.\nRobinson suggests this is only because the journalist is “too much of a coward” to express his views, and begins to grill him on his opinions on Islam and child grooming gangs — prompting him to say he has “said enough” and begin to physically flee.\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/08/20/watch-tommy-robinson-confronts-doorstepping-msm-journo-who-tracked-his-family-down-on-holiday/"}
