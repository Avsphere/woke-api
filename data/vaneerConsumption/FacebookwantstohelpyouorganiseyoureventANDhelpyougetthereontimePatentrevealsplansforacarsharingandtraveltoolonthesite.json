An illustration from the patent showing one of the options is pictured above\nAccording to the filing, the tool is designed so that once someone has indicated they're attending an event, the site would also ask them whether they are driving or not.\nThey will also be encouraged to offer a ride to friends, or request a lift if they have no way of getting there themselves.\n'The indication that the user intends to attend the event and drive/not drive is received and used to facilitate ridesharing,' the patent, filed by Facebook in July 2014, explained.\nThe feature would then look at people's personal information, such as interests, friends and location, to match passengers to drivers.\nAccording to the filing, the tool is designed so that once someone has indicated they're attending an event, the site would also ask them whether they are driving or not. They will also be encouraged to offer a ride to friends, or request a lift if they have no way of getting there themselves (illustrated)\n'For example, the user may indicate a maximum number of passengers the user is willing to take to the event, a set of users that may be matched with the driver for a rideshare, a departure location, a threshold distance or location the user is willing to travel to pick up a passenger, an earliest departure time, etc,' the patent continued.\nOnce a group agrees to a carpool, the driver would additionally get a suggested route.\n'An estimated travel time may be calculated based upon the determined route,' the patent added.\nThe system may 'provide notifications to the passenger(s), e.g. of when the driver departs, when the driver picks up another passenger, when the driver is approaching, an estimated pick up time, etc.'\nThe proposed feature could also let friends organise taking public transport together.\nThe patent says: 'the user may indicate a maximum number of passengers the user is willing to take to the event, a set of users that may be matched with the driver for a rideshare, a departure location, a threshold distance or location the user is willing to travel to pick up a passenger.' An illustration is shown\nThe feature would then look at people's personal information, such as interests, friends and location, to match passengers to drivers (a jokey example from the patent is shown left). An estimated travel time may also be calculated based upon the determined route (pictured right)\nFor example, in one embodiment, non-driving users would be presented with an option to co-ordinate travel with one or more other attendees.\nIf two users indicate that they plan to attend an event and travel to the event via a train line, bus line, taxi, the tool may suggest the users get on same train.\nCommenting on its Q4 earnings earlier this week, Facebook revealed more than 500 million people use 'Events' to manage their social life every month, collectively organising up some 123 million events in 2015.\nElsewhere, the social network recently integrated features to order an Uber using the site's messaging.\nMark Zuckerberg has said Facebook plans to bringing more transport platforms to Messenger this year, and roll out the Uber service in more countries than just the US.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3422746/Facebook-wants-help-organise-event-help-time-Patent-reveals-plans-car-sharing-travel-tool-site.html"}
