We are finished.'\nThe Scottish MP has since made her Twitter account private - hiding her Twitter history.\nThe row came to an end after Rowling suggested she would take legal action against McGarry.\nThe Harry Potter author tweeted: 'You don't appear to understand how Twitter or defamation works.\n'I'm going to help you out with the latter,' adding that any damages she wins will go to her charity.\nFinally, McGarry cited the actual tweet from October 2015. Rowling responded by saying she was praising the account for donating to her charity, Lumos.\nMcGarry was forced to resign the SNP party whip last November after police named her as part of their investigation into allegations that Â£30,000 of donations had gone missing from the pro-independence campaign group Women for Independence (WFI).\nWithdrawing the party whip leads to an automatic suspension from the party.\nThe suspension came just six months after winning the Glasgow East seat off former Shadow Scotland Secretary Margaret Curran.\nMcGarry, who co-founded WFI in 2012, denied any wrongdoing.\nShe was the second SNP MP to leave the party following Edinburgh West MP's Michelle Thomson suspension over allegations of mortgage fraud involving property deals.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422386/JK-Rowling-threatens-sue-suspended-SNP-MP-Natalie-McGarry-Twitter-row.html"}
