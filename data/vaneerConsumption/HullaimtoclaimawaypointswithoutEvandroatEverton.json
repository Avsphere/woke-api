The Tigers have taken only five points from 14 away league fixtures since securing promotion in May - their only victory came at Swansea on August 20 - and they have not won at Goodison Park since 1952.\n'Of course we do need to improve our performance away,' said Silva, whose side's 2-1 home win against Swansea last week left them third from bottom, one point from safety.\n'In some (away) games we have improved, we've shown progress, but the results achieved are not the best.\n'Only against Man United (0-0) we had a very good result, but the others no, and our last performance away against Leicester was not the best, that's clear.\nEvandro has not played for the Tigers since a cameo in the defeat by Arsenal on February 11\nHull have moved to within a point of safety after a resurgence under manager Marco Silva\nSeason at a glance Live tables\nFixtures\nScores Premier League\nPremier League\nChampionship\nLeague One\nLeague Two\nScottish Premiership\nScottish Div 1\nScottish Div 2\nScottish Div 3\nLigue 1\nSerie A\nLa Liga\nBundesliga\n'We need to improve this situation and we've worked this week in a bid to take points.'\nSilva's home league record since arriving at the KCOM in early January is impressive, with three wins and a draw, but defeats at Chelsea, Arsenal and Leicester have prevented them from climbing out of the bottom three.\n'Our form at home has been very good because we've achieved results and this gives confidence to our players,' he added.\n'We've had good performances away, but not achieved the results and we need to change this situation as soon as possible because the 10 games we have left in the Premier League, not only are there five at home, but five of them are away and we need to take points.'\nSilva has no new injury concerns and confirmed midfielder Markus Henriksen was back in training after a shoulder injury.\nOumar Niasse will be unable to play against his parent club Everton at Goodison Park\nCurtis Davies is available again but Andrea Ranocchia (right) may keep his place in the side\nIt remains to be seen whether centre-half Curtis Davies will be recalled to the starting line-up after returning as an unused substitute following a hamstring injury last week.\nSilva must decide whether to retain Andrea Ranocchia alongside Harry Maguire at the heart of defence.\nMaguire had been widely tipped for his first senior call-up by England after a string of outstanding displays for the Tigers this season, but was omitted from Gareth Southgate's squad which was announced on Thursday for the forthcoming friendlies against Germany and Lithuania.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4320806/Hull-aim-claim-away-points-without-Evandro-Everton.html"}
