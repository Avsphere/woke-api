Tony Ferguson is out there, the Floyd Mayweather thing is out there, we’ll see how this thing plays out.'\nWhite also told Conan O'Brian: 'There’s so much money involved. I just don’t see how it doesn’t happen.'\nThe softening of White's stance could now open the door for a deal to be finalised as both fighters remain keen on agreeing terms.\nMcGregor has been taking time away from competition since his victory at UFC 205\nMayweather has publicly stated his desire to take on the charismatic Dubliner and noted the UFC star is the only man who will tempt him out of retirement.\nMcGregor has pushed for the contest for months despite taking time off to be with his long-term partner Dee Devlin ahead of the birth of their first child.\nThe waters have been muddied in the lightweight division by Khabib Nurmagomedov's failure to make weight at UFC 209.\nThe undefeated American boxer said he would come out of retirement to face McGregor\nNurmagomedov was scheduled to take on Tony Ferguson in what would have effectively been a title eliminator fight to face McGregor but the Dagestani was hospitalised at the 11th hour and the bout cancelled.\nWith the interim title fight called off, McGregor's hopes of facing Mayweather have improved and White's remarkably softened approach could pave the way for one of the biggest fights of all time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/ufc/article-4319086/Dana-White-u-turn-Conor-McGregor-vs-Floyd-Mayweather.html"}
