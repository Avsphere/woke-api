John Lewis, who made national headlines when he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he will skip the inauguration next week.\nAs Atlantans got wind of Trump’s tweets, they began flooding social media with photos of their fifth district neighborhoods using a variety of hashtags including #defendthe5th and #fifthdistrict. Here’s what some residents think of Trump’s criticism:\n» RELATED | Voices from the 5th district: “This is where I want to be”\n» RELATED | 12 (other) times Rep. john Lewis broke the internet\n[...] Congrats to #Atlanta - just proclaimed by the president-elect as \"crime-infested\" and in \"horrible shape.\"\nDon't guess he'll be stopping by. pic.twitter.com/YFmcbx2x9I — johnnorth (@jnbeatlefan) January 14, 2017\n[...]\n[...]\n#fifthdistrict isn't perfect, but it's in pretty good shape if you ask me pic.twitter.com/Ihn66jXbgn — Kathryn (@kath_ebooks) January 14, 2017\n» RELATED | Politicians, pundits slam Trump for Lewis comments\n» RELATED | Atlanta Mayor Reed to Trump: “John Lewis an American hero.
