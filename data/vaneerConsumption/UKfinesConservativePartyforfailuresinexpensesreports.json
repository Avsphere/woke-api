A dozen police forces are also looking into whether laws were broken in the 2015 contest.\nThe fines follow reports from Channel 4 news that the Conservatives incorrectly recorded spending on bus tours that took activists to campaign in key areas.\nCommission chairman John Holmes says the failures \"undermined voters' confidence in our democratic processes.\"\nThe commission said there was a \"realistic prospect\" that the party gained a \"financial advantage\" over opponents in the 2015 vote.\nIt is the largest fine ever imposed by the commission.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319326/UK-fines-Conservative-Party-failures-expenses-reports.html"}
