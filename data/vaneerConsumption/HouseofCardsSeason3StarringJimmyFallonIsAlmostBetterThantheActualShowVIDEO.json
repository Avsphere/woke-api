On last night's episode, Fallon paid homage to some of Netflix's most popular shows with a skit called House of Cue Cards , that, as the name suggests, mostly parodied House of Cards. Fallon portrayed a Frank Underwood-type version of himself (fake southern accent and all — he does it surprisingly well for someone from Brooklyn!), while former The New Normal star Ellen Barkin portrays Claire Fallon (a.k.a., Claire Underwood, a.k.a. Robin Wright's character in the series), his wife. Instead of attempting to secure the vice-presidency, as Frank is in the series, Jimmy is focused on running The Tonight Show in the darkest way possible — fourth wall breaks and all.\nI can honestly say this is one of the best skits I've ever seen a late night television show produce — it even surpasses that Glee parody Fallon did years back on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon that included the cast of Parks & Recreation when Aubrey Plaza had long hair, or that super involved Breaking Bad skit, \"Joking Bad,\" that he produced last year. It includes all the proper throwbacks to House of Cards without seeming overdone, and even manages to include Orange Is the New Black for a few seconds too.\nPlus, the end — I won't ruin the ending, or the fact that there's a very special guest included when the scene shifts to a subway stop at Grand Central (hint, hint, spoiler, HINT!), but I will say that part two of this skit is worth watching until the very end. You're not gonna wanna miss this.\nCheck out the skit below.\nPart 1:\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on YouTube\nPart 2:\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on YouTube\nImage: The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon/YouTube","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35579-house-of-cards-season-3-starring-jimmy-fallon-is-almost-better-than-the-actual-show"}
