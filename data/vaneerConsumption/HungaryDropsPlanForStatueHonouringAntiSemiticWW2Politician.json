He died in prison in 1951.\nIn 2015 a Hungarian court posthumously acquitted him of war crimes charges.\nHungary’s Jewish community and the World Jewish Congress had called on the right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party to block the plan which would have been partly funded by government money.\nU.S. special envoy against anti-Semitism Ira Forman said on Sunday that the plan seemed “incomprehensible”.\nReplying to a question from a Socialist opposition MP, Orban said in parliament on Tuesday that he did not back plans for the statue.\n“The government cannot support the erection of a statue for a politician who … collaborated with Hungary’s oppressors, regardless of what other merits he had,” Orban said.\nThe World Jewish Congress has praised Orban’s decision saying his “clear statement on this matter comes very late, but it is nonetheless welcome”.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/12/18/hungary-drops-plan-for-statue-honouring-anti-semitic-ww2-politician/"}
