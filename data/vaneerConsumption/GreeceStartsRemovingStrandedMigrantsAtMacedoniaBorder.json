A Moroccan man was electrocuted to death on the line last week.\nMacedonia has erected a metal fence to keep others out and plans to extend it to cover more than 40 km (25 miles) of the border.\nMore than 600,000 people have arrived in Greece this year by making the short but perilous journey by boat or rubber dinghy from Turkey to outlying islands. Thousands more have drowned.\nIn another such incident, Greek coastguard recovered the bodies of 11 people, including five children, after their wooden boat sank off the island of Farmakonisi in the early hours on Wednesday, a coastguard official said.\nSome 23 people were rescued, while 13 were still missing, the official added.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/12/09/greece-starts-removing-stranded-migrants-at-macedonia-border/"}
