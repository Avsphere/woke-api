All I can say is that of course I accept this decision, which falls in line with the constitution. One cannot say no to His Majesty,\" he said.\nBenkirane had proposed to rebuild his outgoing coalition, an alliance comprising a range of parties including other Islamists, liberals and ex-communists.\nHowever he faced opposition from Aziz Akhannouch -- leader of the National Rally of Independents (RNI) and a billionaire former agriculture minister who is close to the king -- and the resulting power struggle quickly led to political impasse.\nThe king has \"repeatedly urged Benkirane to accelerate the formation of the new government,\" the palace said in its statement issued late Wednesday.\nBut, after returning at the beginning of the week from a long African tour, the sovereign found negotiations \"had not succeeded\", with little prospect of a break in the deadlock.\nThe PJD was the first Islamist party to win an election in Morocco and the first to lead a government after the king -- whose family claims descent from the Prophet Mohammed and has ruled Morocco since the early 1600s -- gave up some of his power when thousands took to the streets in peaceful demonstrations inspired by the wave of uprisings across the Arab world.\nA senior Moroccan official told AFP \"this decision, where the Islamist PJD retains control over the forming of a future government, shows that the sovereign wants to consolidate the democratic change\".","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4318848/Morocco-king-replace-PM-end-political-impasse.html"}
