Both Jews and Christians, he said, have “the blessing but also the responsibility to help preserve the religious sense of the men and women of today, and that of our society.”\nEuropean society, he said, is “increasingly marked by secularism and threatened by atheism,” and “we run the risk of living as if God did not exist.”\nHe said:\nPeople are often tempted to take the place of God, to consider themselves the criterion of all things, to control them, to use everything according to their own will. It is so important to remember, however, that our life is a gift from God, and that we must depend on Him, confide in Him, and turn towards Him always.\nThis means that “it is more important than ever to emphasize the spiritual and religious dimension of human life,” he said.\nThe Pope appealed for a common Judeo-Christian witness “to the sanctity of God and human life.” God is holy, he said, “and the life He has given is holy and inviolable.”\nFrancis noted that for almost fifty years, “the dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Jewish community has progressed in a systematic way,” which calls for gratitude to the Lord, “rejoicing in our progress and in the friendship which has grown between us,” he said.\nFollow Thomas D.
