If they refuse and continue to ignore their role in promoting incitement, governments must pass legislation forcing them to do so.”\n“Today they are part of the problem. They must become part of the solution,” he added.\nErdan said the Israeli government is taking steps to curb incitement on social media, claiming that such measures have contributed to the drop in violent attacks in recent weeks.\n“We are making progress in combating this wave of violence and incitement,” Erdan said. “We have developed systems to identify potential lone-wolf terrorists from their social media posts, we increased the number of police officers in Jerusalem to enhance both prevention and deterrence, and we outlawed Islamist groups who are inciting violence, such as the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/05/23/israeli-minister-facebook-google-are-part-of-the-problem-in-fighting-terror/"}
