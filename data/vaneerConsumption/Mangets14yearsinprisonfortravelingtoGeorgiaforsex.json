Arrangements were made for a meeting in May of that year at a Hampton Inn in Ringgold, Ga. When Ellis arrived, FBI agents tried to arrest him and he fled, authorities said. A high-speed police chases ended when Ellis’ car crashed.\nEllis was convicted in February after pleading guilty to attempting to have sex with minors, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. In addition to his prison term, he was sentenced to 20 years of supervised release.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/man-gets-years-prison-for-traveling-georgia-for-sex-with-kids/ivOJHBZSJ9IYMCHp52ZrWN/"}
