There were touching tributes from late night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, the Good Will Hunting bench has been memorialized, and, now, Kanye West has added his own tribute. In a new tweet posted today, Kanye West paid tribute to Robin Williams with a simple, but genuine comment: \"Thank you Robin for all of the joy you brought the world.\"\nIt's not much, yes, especially for a man that so often says more than enough. But that's what makes the whole thing even more touching and, above all, genuine: There's no more that needs to be said, because nothing can really put into words the sadness that people all over the world are feeling due to Williams' passing. The grief is palpable.\nWest also included a photo of himself with Williams from an unspecified date, which adds to the power of the tweet.\nWilliams passed away on August 11 at his home in Northern California of a suspected suicide by asphyxia. He is survived by his wife, Susan Schneider, and his three kids. Check out Kanye's tweet below.\nAnd here's a bonus, because I feel like we all need a little joy in our lives right now, and no one was better at giving joy than Robin himself:\n:(\nImages: KanyeWest/Twitter","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35679-kanye-wests-robin-williams-tribute-is-touching-genuine-photo"}
