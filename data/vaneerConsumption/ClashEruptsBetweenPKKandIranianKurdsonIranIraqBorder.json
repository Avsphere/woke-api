Ahmedi, KDPI’s foreign relations chief, argued that his party’s support for the reconciliation process with Turkey instigated the deadly quarrel.\n“The PKK has closed all paths of dialogue despite every attempt,” reportedly said Rustom Jehangiri, head of KDPI’s Military Commission, on Monday.\nHowever, he added that KDPI remains open to negotiations with the PKK.\nA day prior to the fatal attack, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cautioned that the PKK is a serious concern, not only for Turkey, but for other nations in the region as well.\nThe parliament of northern Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which opposes the PKK, condemned the attack in a statement: “We seriously warn both Kurdish parties to avoid the use of violence and the gun in settling their political problems.”\nErdogan accused the PKK of trying to coerce Turkey’s Kurds into voting in favor of the Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP), which he accused of employing “a policy of threats in southeastern regions of Turkey” ahead of the June 7 parliamentary elections.\n“We aim to cherish life, but unfortunately the mentality backed by the terrorist group is still in pursuit of blood, life, threats and terrorizing,” said the president.\nErdogan, while speaking in the predominantly Kurdish province of Sanliurfa on Sunday, accused the PKK and HDP of trying to foment an atmosphere of terror in southeastern Turkey.\nThe Turkish leader reminded the audience of the Oct. 6-8 incidents that left an estimated 50 people dead when groups against and in favor of the PKK confronted one another.\nHe noted, “They are calling it doing politics. Does politics mean harboring the shadow of arms of the terrorist organization? Does politics mean pouring people onto the streets in the Oct. 6-8 incidents and causing 50 deaths?”\n“Here, this is the party [HDP] that is supported by the terrorist organization. Indeed, these divided the country. These pushed this country toward discrimination. They call it Kurd or Arab. They come into the square and say, ‘We are not the divider.’ How are you not the divider? You are the very image of a divider,” added Erdogan.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/05/28/clash-erupts-between-pkk-and-iranian-kurds-on-iran-iraq-border/"}
