A November 2011 report by the Justice Department showed that young African-American men are just 1 percent of the population, yet are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of murders in the nation.\nClinton suggested that people who disagree with her agenda are racists. “There is so much more to be done… we can’t be engaging in hateful rhetoric or incitement of violence, we need to be bringing people together … we need more love and kindness.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/07/08/hillary-clinton-blame-whites-cops-shooting-deaths-young-black-men/"}
