The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nWASHINGTON â€” A federal board investigation into the 2010 BP oil spill concludes that a last-ditch safety device on the underwater well had multiple failures, wasn't tested properly and still poses a risk for many rigs drilling today.\nThe report issued Thursday by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board zeroes in on what went wrong with the blowout preventer and blames bad management and operations. They found faulty wiring in two places, a dead battery and a bent pipe in the hulking device. And that, they said, led to the dumping of 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and the nation's worst offshore oil disaster.\n\"The problems with this blowout preventer were worse than we understood,\" safety board managing director Daniel Horowitz said. \"And there are still hazards out there that need to be improved if we are to prevent this from happening again.\"\nThe massive spill followed an explosion that killed 11 workers at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/problem-bp-oil-spill-exists-many-other-rigs-report-finds-n123706"}
