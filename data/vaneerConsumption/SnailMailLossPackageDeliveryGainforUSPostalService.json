Its net loss for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31 surpassed the first-quarter's loss of $354 million, although it remained flat from the year-ago quarter. It was the 20th of the last 22 quarters that the agency has posted a loss, USPS said. Liabilities totaling $64 billion exceeded current assets by $42 billion, adding to its dire financial situation, the agency said in a statement\nThe Postal Service is also still struggling under the weight of heavy mandatory payments into its future retirees' health fund, which was required by Congress in 2006. The mail carrier has sought legislative relief to allow it to modernize its business service offerings, restructure the retiree payments, and shift to a five-day mail delivery service.\nBut Congress has for years remained gridlocked on postal reforms, partly by pressure from the mailing industry to maintain the status quo as well as some lawmakers' reluctance to see postal services cut back in their districts. The mail agency, which does not rely on taxpayer funds, has said it could require a massive taxpayer-funded bailout in excess of $50 billion by 2017 if Congress fails to act.\n- Reuters\n-","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/snail-mail-loss-package-delivery-gain-u-s-postal-service-n101456"}
