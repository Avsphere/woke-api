Tom Taylor, R-Dunwoody, at the DeKalb Chamber of Commerce 2017 Legislative Preview Breakfast.\nIf approved by the Georgia General Assembly, voters would then have final say on the sales tax during a referendum next year.\nVoters could also be asked whether they want to further raise sales taxes to pay for MARTA projects in DeKalb.\nMARTA’s expansion could eventually include an eastward expansion of heavy rail along I-20 to Stonecrest, along with the light rail Clifton Corridor line from Lindbergh Center Station to Emory University and Avondale Station.\n“We’re going to try to bring that legislation forward and hopefully pass it,” said Rep. Howard Mosby, D-Atlanta.\nBesides sales tax increases, lawmakers also discussed the possibility for cities to expand through annexation.\nSeveral legislators said they want to plan cities’ growth across the county rather than approve piecemeal annexations.\n“We need a holistic approach … before we continue with annexations and incorporations,” said Rep. Michele Henson, D-Stone Mountain.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/sales-tax-proposed-for-roads-and-marta-dekalb/DhKBBfWix9KCOvuHZOg39N/"}
