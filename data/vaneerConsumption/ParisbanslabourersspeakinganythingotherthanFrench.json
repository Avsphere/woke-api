Ile de France will join regions like Normandy and Hauts-de-France who already have a similar ban in place\nOpponents to the Moliere clause, named after the 17th century French playwright, point out that it will disadvantage newly arrived foreigners living in France who are able to integrate via the workplace and learn French.\nIt also risks being difficult to monitor and enforce.\nIle de France are considering employing inspectors to listen in at building sites to check what language they are speaking.\nCritics of the Moliere clause say that it will be difficult to monitor and enforce. Ile de France are thinking about employing inspectors to listen at building site to check what language they are speaking\nOther French regions Normandy, Hauts-de-France and Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes have also introduced rules requiring companies to use the French language on public building sites.\nOfficials have said the move will help safety on work sites, but it will also affect the 500,000 foreign workers who labour on French building sites.\nOleg a Ukranian labourer working in the Parisian outskirts told Le Temps: 'In any case, speaking French does not help much when you moving cement around or demolishing walls.'\nIf Francois Fillon wins the presidential election, he will think about rolling out the ban nationally, rather than letting different regions decide on the rule.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301606/Paris-bans-labourers-speaking-French.html"}
