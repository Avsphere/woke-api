(AP) - A baby zebra born at a central New York wild animal park during this week's snowstorm has been given a fitting name: Blizzard.\nJeff Taylor, owner of The Wild Animal Park in Chittenango, near Syracuse, tells The Post-Standard (http://bit.ly/2n2wjl9 ) that the foal was born around 6 a.m. Tuesday, when a major storm that would eventually dump more than 2 feet of snow on the area was underway.\nTaylor asked for suggestions on Facebook on what to name the baby. Blizzard was the most popular suggestion.\nTaylor says Blizzard is very curious and bold and has a \"great personality.\"\nBlizzard is the third zebra to be born at the animal park and the second to be born there since late December.\nThe animal park is closed for the season. It opens on April 29.\n___\nInformation from: The Post-Standard, http://www.syracuse.com","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319910/Zebra-born-upstate-NY-snowstorm-named-Blizzard.html"}
