During matches, air space within a seven-kilometer radius of stadiums will be declared a no-fly zone.\nIn addition to this small army of police, soldiers and private contractors, there will also be a team of high-tech helpers: 30 robots, known as PackBots, will be on hand to investigate any suspicious packages.\nThe World Cup kicks off on Thursday when host country Brazil takes on Croatia.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/world-cup/infographic-brazils-massive-world-cup-security-plan-n128041"}
