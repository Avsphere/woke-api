Ellen DeLoach was a local artist whose paintings have been exhibited in recent years at the Bill Lowe Gallery in Atlanta.\nTwo other family members were inside the home at the time of the shooting, but were able to escape unharmed, the police spokeswoman said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/relative-arrested-cobb-shooting-deaths-man-and-woman/synfuEvAsabnPcJOExiiwM/"}
