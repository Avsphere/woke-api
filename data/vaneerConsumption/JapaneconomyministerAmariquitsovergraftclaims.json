He did not say how much was received in total.\n\"The economy is now on the verge of getting out of deflation after 15 years,\" Amari said.\n\"We need to enact a package of bills as quickly as we can to bring about a strong economy, and we need to avoid any obstacles to that -- I will not be an exception.\"\nAbe has lost three other ministers to political funding scandals since he swept to power in late 2012.\nSuch controversies are not uncommon in Japanese politics where the pork barrel reigns and rules on spending tend to be slightly opaque, barring little except explicit bribery and vote buying.\nIn 2014, two female ministers resigned over allegations that they had misspent money in what opponents insisted was an attempt to buy votes.\nLast year, farm minister Koya Nishikawa resigned after being accused of accepting illegal political funds.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420601/Japan-economy-minister-Amari-quits-graft-claims.html"}
