But those eggs aren’t expected to hatch until at least 30 more days, a college spokeswoman said Monday.\nIf the two latest eggs hatch, they will be the fourth and fifth offspring for the parent eagles, who have called Berry home since spring 2012.\nIn less than three years, the eagle family has become the most popular residents on the 27,000-acre campus, thanks to the “Eagle Cam,” which allows virtual access to the birds from anywhere. On Sunday, the Eagle Cam recorded a record 20 million views, the college said.\nThe birds are so popular, they have their own Facebook page, where more than 84,000 followers get frequent updates.\nThe pair successfully produced two eaglets, named B1 and B2, in early 2013. Last year, two eggs were laid, but only one was viable, according to Christine Kozelle, Berry spokeswoman. B3 was born in early 2014. All of these eaglets successfully fledged, but are sometimes spotted on campus.\nOn Jan. 6, the first egg of the year was laid, and a second followed Friday. The eggs should hatch between 33 and 37 days, meaning February could be an exciting time for the eagles and their fans.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/berry-college-eagle-lays-eggs/GFY8425YbPoVFrI4vHeasM/"}
