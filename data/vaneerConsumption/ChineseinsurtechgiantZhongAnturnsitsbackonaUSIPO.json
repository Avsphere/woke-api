Back in August, ZhongAn said it planned to IPO either in the US or Hong Kong by 2017, but Bloomberg's most recent sources said ZhongAn has told its lawyers to stop preparations and focus on an IPO in its home market.\nThere are several possible reasons why ZhongAn thinks it would be better to IPO in China than the US:\nThe US market may not be as friendly as it first appeared. Firms that pursue an IPO outside of their home market usually believe that investors and analysts in an international market better understand their business model. ZhongAn may have been considering the US because numerous fintechs have already IPO'd there, setting a precedent. But there have been notably few fintech IPOs in the US this year, reflecting investor caution in the industry and toward fintechs' business models. This may have put ZhongAn off a US IPO, and it wouldn't be alone if that were the case â€” just this week US alt lender SoFi delayed its planned public offering.\nPresident-elect Trump's hostile stance toward Chinese business. During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly lambasted Chinese business for stealing US jobs, threatened to label China as a currency manipulator, and said he would impose high tariffs on Chinese imports. This has likely left Chinese companies uncertain about how to approach the US market, and they will probably remain cautious until Trump enters office and his policies toward foreign companies take shape.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-insurtech-giant-zhong-an-turns-its-back-on-a-us-ipo-2016-12"}
