They have a direct impact on local services.”\nHavering Council is controlled by the Conservatives.\nPrime Minister David Cameron called a referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union after winning last year’s general election.\nThe vote is expected to be held this year and opinion polls currently point to a small lead for those who want out of the EU.\nCouncils are not obliged to take a position on whether they want to remain in the EU ahead of the referendum and votes will only take place where individual councillors table motions on the issue.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/01/28/london-local-council-votes-to-back-brexit-in-referendum/"}
