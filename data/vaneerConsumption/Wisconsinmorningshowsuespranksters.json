'They're trying to scare us, but we're going to fight it because we're well within our rights doing what we did.'\nSimilar to the Hans and Franz bodybuilders of Saturday Night Live, the pair subtly poked fun of strongmen while doing embarrassingly bizarre strength exercises\nThe pair showed how to increase strength while body pressing each other and Chop discussed violent outbursts he would have while on steriods\nJoe Pickett (left) and Nick Prueher of Found Footage Festival are being sued by Gray Television for fraud and copyright infringement\nGray Television is claiming fraud and copyright infringement, asking the court to find that the pair infringed on the copyright of the episode of Hello Wisconsin in which they appeared.\nPrueher admitted the suit was 'a little scary' but also 'amusing.'\n'If they had doneâ€¦ their due diligence, that I feel like is the responsibility of a news organization, they would have known this was a goof, but you know, they didn't,' he said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446308/Wisconsin-morning-sues-pranksters.html"}
