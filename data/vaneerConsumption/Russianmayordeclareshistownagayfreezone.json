Pictured, town celebrations in Svetogorsk\nSergey Davydov has been ridiculed by his critics for imposing the ban on a town with a population of 15,000. Already two LGBT activists have been stopped from entering the town\nHe insisted 'there are and will be no gays' in his industrial town.\nAs his opponents have pointed out, it is unclear how the mayor can vouch for his claim, but since his announcement two LGBT activists were detained seeking to enter Svetogorsk after travelling from St Petersburg.\nThe pair were 'expelled' from the town which requires special permits to enter because it lies on the border, said Davydov, a former military officer in the Russian army.\nHe claimed that gay parades were held 'all the time' in nearest city St Petersburg, where Putin was born.\n'Did you ever see a gay parade in Svetogorsk?' he asked.\n'No evidence is needed. Just show me one gay and then we'll talk about it.\nMayor Davydov decided to bring in the ban when he found out that the local bakery was selling penis-shaped lollipops (pictured)\n'I offer this every day but nobody ever comes.'\nHe was happy to meet 'all those who ready to argue about the presence of people with non-traditional sexual behaviour in our town', he said.\nDavydov apparently acted after being scandalised that a local bakery sold penis-shaped lollipops.\nThe policy has been praised by Vyborg district boss Gennady Orlov, who said gay people should go to Europe\nHis discriminatory policy has won support in Vyborg district, where regional boss Gennady Orlov said: 'I support Davydov.\n'There cannot be gay people in Vyborg District - and there must not be any.\n'All those who want to be gay should go to Europe.'\nAnd Konstantin Platonov, head Ivangorod, which borders Estonia, a former Soviet republic now in the EU and NATO, also backed the ban which flouts Russia's human rights commitments in international agreements.\n'I don't know any gay people,' he said.\n'I did not meet them in our town.\n'And I hope I never meet them here.'\nMeanwhile, regional MP Vladimir Petrov, who represents Slantsy district, said: 'I understand Svetogorsk town is free from gays, because this is what the mayor, a colonel of the Russian army, has said.\n'And who can we trust more in this country if not an officer?\nDavydov claimed that gay parades were held 'all the time' in nearest city St Petersburg, where Putin was born. Pictured, the town of Svetogorsk\nThe mayor has been branded a 'clown' and an 'idiot' for thinking that there are no gay people in the town of Svetogorsk. Pictured, the town during the winter\n'I can say, too, that the whole of Slantsy district is free from gays.\n'So we have joined the fight, and we are close to the border (with the West).\n'Estonia is very close.'\nOne critic wrote: 'I wonder what this is about - idiocy or light-fascism?'\nAnother commented: 'We need to impose at least a minimal brain test for officials.'\nOne critic wrote: 'I wonder what this is about - idiocy or light-fascism?'. Regional MP Vladimir Petrov claims there are no gay people in the whole Slantsy district\nOne reader asked why Putin's United Russia party did not have a higher calibre of politicians to fill local posts. Another asked: 'I wonder how he checked all 15,000 people in his town?'\nA further comment on a local news site read: 'He is not just a colonel, he's also a clown.'\nAnother critic wrote: 'I have always known that military men are a bit simple-minded, but to such an extent?'\nOne reader asked why Putin's United Russia party did not have a higher calibre of politicians to fill local posts.\nAnother asked: 'I wonder how he checked all 15,000 people in his town?'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4300638/Russian-mayor-declares-town-gay-free-zone.html"}
