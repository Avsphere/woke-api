They had the pregnant woman step out of the truck, get on her knees and put her hands behind her head.\nBoth the pregnant woman and a passenger were “briefly handcuffed,” then released once the LAPD officers realized it was a case of mistaken identity. LAPD made clear they took “precautions” because the windows of truck were tinted, which hindered them from clearly seeing the truck’s occupants.\nRaw Story reports “two small children were allegedly inside [the vehicle] at the time of the mistaken stop.”\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
