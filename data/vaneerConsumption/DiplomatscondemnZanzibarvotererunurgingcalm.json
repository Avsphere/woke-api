Zanzibar's election commission announced last week that fresh polls would be held on March 20 and the CUF have said it would boycott the vote.\nZanzibar's 500,000 registered voters also cast ballots for Tanzania's national president, and despite the cancellation of the vote on the islands, new Tanzanian President John Magufuli was sworn into office last year.\nThe diplomats called on Magufuli to \"pursue his previous calls for a negotiated solution between parties, so as to ensure a peaceful outcome.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3423024/Diplomats-condemn-Zanzibar-vote-run-urging-calm.html"}
