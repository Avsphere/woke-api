We must have American dominance in space.” He cited China and Russia as our competition in this frontier.\nBeyond the space force, the President also signed a directive at the end of his speech which will “work together with American industry to implement a state-of-the-art framework for space traffic management.” In addition to this, President Trump pledged “an eventual mission to Mars— which is actually going to happen very quickly.”\nThe President went on to encourage the private sector’s participation in this newfound pledge to space. Talking about “all of those rich guys that are dying for our real estate to launch their rockets,” Trump pledged to allow private organizations to use government facilities for launches in an effort to bring in all facets of American ingenuity to the forefront of this adventure ahead.\nTrump also went on to criticize “out-of-date space regulations,” though he did not mention any specifically. He pledged to modernize them as part of his new omni-push for space exploration.","url":"https://spectator.org/trump-the-return-of-a-space-president/"}
