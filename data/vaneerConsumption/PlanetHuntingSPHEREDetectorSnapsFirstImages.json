But scientists have rarely been able to look at these worlds directly because the weak glow of a planet is often overwhelmed by the bright light from its parent star.\nSPHERE is designed to get the highest contrast possible in a small patch of sky around a star to see exoplanets that might otherwise be hidden.\nTo boost the contrast in its images, SPHERE uses adaptive optics to correct for the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere as well as a coronagraph also blocks out starlight.\nSPHERE's first shot, taken in the infrared wavelength, shows the dust ring around the nearby star HR 4796A, which is in the southern constellation of Centaurus. Though it doesn't show a planet, the clarity of this disc demonstrates SPHERE's impressive ability to reduce the glare from a star, ESO officials said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/planet-hunting-sphere-detector-snaps-first-images-n123131"}
