JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) — Offspinner Sunil Narine was included in the West Indies squad for the World Twenty20 despite being suspended from bowling in internationals because of an illegal action.\nNarine, who has had issues since 2011, was reported in November, after which testing confirmed his technique exceeded allowable tolerances. In the meantime, he has been working on his action so he can pass tests next month back at Loughborough University in England.\nThe team announced on Friday included Chris Gayle, who has played in every World T20, but courted controversy for inappropriate comments aimed at TV presenter Mel McLaughlin during Australia's Big Bash this month.\nLeft-arm spinner Sulieman Benn, who hasn't played for the West Indies in eight months but finished the recent Caribbean one-day championship as the top wicket-taker has also been selected.\nAllrounder Darren Sammy was reappointed captain of the top-ranked team for the World T20 in India in March.\nSammy will lead the team for a third consecutive World T20: West Indies won in 2012, and reached the semifinals in 2014.\nThe 15-man squad included 11 players who triumphed in 2012, beating Sri Lanka in the final.\nThe squad will assemble in the United Arab Emirates for a training camp from Feb. 22, and will travel to India on March 7 for warm-up matches against India and Australia.\nThe West Indies opens the World T20 against England on March 16 in Mumbai, and follows with group games against Sri Lanka, South Africa, and a qualifier.\n___","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3423131/Narine-West-Indies-T20-squad-pending-passing-bowling-test.html"}
