On Christmas Day, McAuliffe was thrown from a horse and wound up with seven broken ribs. A doctor examined McAuliffe in Tanzania, but he was not hospitalized at the time.\nSince returning home, doctors have been monitoring McAuliffeâ€™s condition. After a check up Monday he was admitted to Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center after doctors found some fluid had built up in his lungs. The governor is expected to be hospitalized overnight and then will take a few days off to recover.\nUntil today the governor had carried on with his schedule, even giving a state-of-the-state speech last week. He attended an event in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Monday morning before being hospitalized.\nMcAuliffe and his family traveled to Africa over the holidays to visit his daughter who is working in Zambia.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/01/19/governor-mcauliffe-hospitalized-to-treat-african-safari-injury/"}
