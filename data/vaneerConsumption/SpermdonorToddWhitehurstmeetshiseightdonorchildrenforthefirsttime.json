'Why wouldn't you want and why wouldn't you want to help those people out?'\nFor four years, Whitehurst donated to the same clinic about 400 times and followed the protocol required.\nHe signed the agreement all donors sign to remain anonymous and received a unique donor ID number from the clinic.\nThe families in return, receive only basic information about the donors including their age, ethnicity and birthplace.\nOne single donation at a sperm bank can produce up to 24 sellable vials, and with Whitehursts' estimated 400 donations, that could have produced 9,600 sellable vials, according to CBS.\nTwo of his donor children, Sarah Malley (left) and Carey Phelps (right) are pictured together during the family gathering. They were among the eight half siblings who met last July\nWhitehurst said that he has 22 donor children that he knows of.\nSix months before the family gathering, one of his donor children 20-year-old Sarah Malley, learned that she and her twin sister Jenna were donor babies, according to CBS.\nMalley contacted Whitehurst through an online database called Donor Sibling Registry and helped organize the family gathering.\nShe said it was 'overwhelming' seeing him when he first walked up.\n'I was worried it would be just like a \"Hello, it's nice to meet you\" handshake. We hugged. And that was like a whole big thing,' she told CBS.\nThe networking site Donor Sibling Register, founded by Wendy Kramer, was set up for children who want to connect by matching their donor father's unique ID number.\n'It's an innate human desire to want to know where we come from,' Kramer told CBS.\nWhitehurst said he had spotted an ad in his school paper while a Stanford graduate student in 1998 for young men needed for sperm donation\nCarey Phelps, also one of Whitehursts' donor children, wanted to know her biological father and found him when she was 14 years old.\nPhelps, who is the daughter of a single mother, said she had known she was a donor child from an early age and spent two weeks searching for him online with the little information she had.\n'That moment when I saw his face for the first time, it's just, it's incredible' she recalled of when she saw a photo of him.\nAfter finding him, Phelps emailed Whitehurst and they met in person.\nThe pair grew close and eventually even took vacations together, some with his other donor children like the one last July, according to CBS.\nThe donor dad said that while he is not his donor children's parent, he does feel a responsibility for their lives going forward and called them all 'remarkable children'\nShe said she never felt like something was missing in her life but felt honored being able to meet her half siblings.\n'I never felt like there was something missing, because I've been so lucky,' Phelps told CBS.\n'I'm so wanted, and that's something that I think a lot of kids can't say for certain.\n'And so being able to meet all of these totally different, but at the same time, very related siblings is, it's such an incredible honor for me to grow up this way.'\nWhitehurst said that while he is not his donor children's parent, he does feel a responsibility for their lives going forward.\n'It's sort of the responsibility I feel as an uncle. I realize I'm not their parent, right? Their parents are primarily responsible for them,' he said.\n'But if their parents are unable to help them, then I would step in and do what I could.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393237/Sperm-donor-meets-kids-s-fathered-eight-donor-children-meet-time.html"}
