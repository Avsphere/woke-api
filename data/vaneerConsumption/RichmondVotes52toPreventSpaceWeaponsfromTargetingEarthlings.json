The council voted 5-2 on May 19 to endorse a resolution banning space-based weapons “to ensure that individuals will not be targets of space-based weapons.”\nThe action was triggered by a small group of people who believe that government agencies, among others, are “targeting” individuals with mind control.\nThe resolution came from controversial Councilwoman Jovanka Beckles, who was supported by councilmembers Eduardo Martinez, Gayle McLaughlin, Vice Mayor Jael Myrick and Nat Bates, and opposed by member Vinay Pimple and Mayor Tom Butt. Beckles, Martinez and McLaughlin are members of the Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA); Martinez has lauded the work of avowed socialist Bernie Sanders. The resolution was inspired by the “Space Preservation Act” and “Space Preservation Treaty” repeatedly brought by Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D–Ohio, in 2001, 2002, and 2005.\nBeckles told the San Francisco Chronicle that the resolution was catalyzed by a meeting with a Richmond woman who “informed me she was a survivor of such horrible attacks. According to her description, these government patented technologies and weapons interfere and disrupt the targeted individual’s health physically and psychologically by remote transmission.”\nButt stated in his weekly newsletter, “For a moment I was inclined to support it simply because of the symbolic relief it would bring to (people), and I could see no downside. On the other hand, I considered the message this would send to the hundred thousand or more Richmond residents who are not ‘targeted’ by mind control technology and do not suffer routine physical pain from space-based weapons.”\nOn his Facebook page, Butt posted several articles making fun of the council’s vote,","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2015/05/27/richmond-votes-5-2-to-prevent-space-weapons-from-targeting-earthlings/"}
