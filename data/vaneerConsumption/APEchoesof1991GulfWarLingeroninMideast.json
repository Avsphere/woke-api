Saddam Hussein, demonized as being worse than Adolf Hitler by President George H.W. Bush, would outlast his American rival in power until Bushâ€™s son launched the 2003 American-led invasion that toppled the Iraqi dictator.\nNow, 25 years after the first U.S. Marines swept across the border into Kuwait, American forces are battling the extremist Islamic State group, born out of al-Qaida, in the splintered territories of Iraq and Syria. The Arab allies that joined the 1991 coalition are fighting their own conflicts at home and abroad, as Iran vies for greater regional power following a nuclear deal with world powers.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/02/22/ap-echoes-of-1991-gulf-war-linger-on-in-mideast/"}
