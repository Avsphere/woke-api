I have watched a lot of James' games in detail, and again even before we met him, we saw that he had a lot of the qualities and the potential we think to do well in the Premiership.'\nJersey back row forward James Freeman (left) will also join Exeter on a two-year deal","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-4319314/Exeter-sign-Australia-international-scrum-half-Nic-White.html"}
