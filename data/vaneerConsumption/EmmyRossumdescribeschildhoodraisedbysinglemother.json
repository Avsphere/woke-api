I have a single mom. This isn't a secret. Growing up in a school — and a world — filled with mostly two parent units was difficult for me. Father's Day still is difficult for me.\n'I'm not really sure how to celebrate. In the weeks leading up to it, I sense it coming like a wave approaching. Sometimes I try to ignore it — but the ads in the paper or online banner ads for \"Macy's Fathers Day Cologne Sale!\" and restaurants selling \"Father's Day Brunch Mimosas!\" can make that pretty tricky.\n'Sometimes, I take my mom to brunch and get her a present, to show her how much I value her. She really was both a mother and a father for me. I don't like her to know that it still causes me pain - 30 years later - lest she feel somehow that she wasn't enough.\n'She was always enough. She is enough. She wasn't perfect, no one is, but for me she was the best mom ever.'\n'She was the best mom ever': The Shameless star raved about her mother Cheryl in her candid post (pictured in 2013)\nMake her feel special: The actress says she's gone out of her way to treat her mother with brunch and presents (pictured in 2015)\nEmmy also said she resonated with Katie, who suggested changing the name of 'Father Daughter' dance to 'Friend Dance' to her children's school.\nEmmy says these traditions - including being walked down the aisle - have been particularly painful for her.\n'Some of these traditions are really hard for those of us who don't have. Even today, the idea of no father/daughter dance at my wedding. No father to walk me down the aisle. All of these \"traditions\" are painful reminders that inadvertently re-injure us, causing a feeling of loss, jealously (of others who have what I didn't), anger and confusion. Usually leading to us feel somehow inadequate.'\nChildhood: Rossum was born in Manhattan and is the only child of her mother (pictured in Santa Monica in 2016)\nEmmy was born in Manhattan and is the only child of her mother.\nIn 2007, the actress told USA Today her mother and father separated when Cheryl was still pregnant.\nShe told the website she's only met her father twice.\nSpeaking about her debut album Inside Out, Emmy told the website: 'I've been this glossy, red-carpet version of me and not talked about myself, for a long time. But the last track on the album (Anymore) is about how being abandoned shouldn't make you feel ashamed … I miss him, or I miss the idea of what he could be. But a lot of people have filled that void.'\nEmmy is now engaged to television producer Sam Esmail, who is the creator of the critically acclaimed series Mr. Robot.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4447936/Emmy-Rossum-describes-childhood-raised-single-mother.html"}
