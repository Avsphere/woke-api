Bush did not lie about Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass distraction in the buildup to the 2003 Iraq war.\nWoodward said, “Iraq is a symbol. You can make a persuasive argument there was a mistake. But there is a kinda line going on that Bush and the other people lied about this. I spent 18 months looking at how Bush decided to invade Iraq. Lots of mistakes, but it was Bush telling George Tenet the CIA director, don’t let anyone stretch the case on WMD. He was the one who was skeptical. If you try to summarize why we went into Iraq, it was momentum. The war plan kept getting better and easier, and finally at the end, people were saying, ‘Hey, look, it will only take a week or two.’ Early on it looked like it was going to take a year or 18 months, so Bush pulled the trigger. A mistake certainly can be argued, and there is an abundance of evidence. But there was no lie in this that I could find.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/24/woodward-bush-did-not-lie-about-wmd-he-was-skeptical/"}
