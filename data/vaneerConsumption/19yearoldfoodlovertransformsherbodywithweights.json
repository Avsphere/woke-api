Also filling Teagan's feed are the kind of before and after photos that would seem more at home on a #fitspo account.\nThat's because the 19-year-old Melbourne student is out to prove that reaching your body goals doesn't have to mean giving up amazing food.\nTeagan Williams-Chen, 19, has become popular among the fitness community on Instagram for her incredible gains since she began weightlifting\nBut the Melbourne student is also out to prove that reaching your body goals doesn't have to mean giving up amazing food\nAlthough there are plenty of acai bowls and leafy greens on display across Teagan's page, the weightlifter wants to prove to girls that weight gain isn't a bad thing.\nAs Teagan posted pictures of her incredible muscle gain and body transformations, more and more followers were asking about her diet.\n'I always try to post so much food,' Teagan told Daily Mail Australia.\n'My Instagram has way more food than anything else and I don't hold back with what people conventionally see as unhealthy food.'\n'I'm a great food lover and I want to show people that you can do things that are fitness and health related, without restricting yourself.'\nTeagan's Instagram is filled with mouth-watering food that doesn't look waistline friendly\nLearning that getting fit can be fun is a lesson Teagan has learned since starting her body transformation journey two years ago.\nTeagan first began to work out after gaining a lot of weight while traveling with family overseas, feeling unhappy with her body and diet.\nShe began Kayla Itsines' Bikini Body Guide and the weight immediately began to fall off.\nTeagan weighed 57 kilos after completing those first 12 weeks and although she was happy with the results, she found herself getting caught up in her own progress.\n'It became kind of addicting in a way that wasn't healthy,' she said. 'I used to be obsessed with working out a certain number of days...and it was getting really straining and stressful.'\nBut the weightlifter wants to prove to girls that weight gain isn't a bad thing, and that balance and finding a workout they love should be the goal instead\nAs her fitness routine felt more and more repetitive, Teagan found that she wasn't seeing any new progress and the gym was beginning to feel like a chore.\n'Not much was changing about my body and it was getting hard doing the same repetitive things,' she said.\n'I was sort of losing faith, and knew I needed to change something.'\nThat's when Teagan began to dabble with weightlifting exercises, and it was love at first lift.\nShe was struck by the immediate changes she saw in her body and loved the new freedom that weightlifting gave her.\n'I didn't have a strict routine at all and that made me feel really free and good,' she said.\n'Once you start enjoying what you do, you're going to do it better and more often. That's when the progress began, when I reached that happiness with my routine.'\nWeightlifting became not just a means to get fit, but a passion for Teagan and it is now her sole kind of exercise.\nIt was love at first lift for Teagan when she first began weightlifting as her old gym routine began to feel like a chore\nShe no longer follows anyone else's plan, instead making up and modifying her own routines as she learns more and more about weightlifting.\n'Fitness and working out shouldn't be a stressful situation,' she said.\n'You can definitely want to improve parts of your body, but it shouldn't be the sole reason you do it.'\nTeagan now weighs around 63 kilos, the very same number that she weighed when she first began her fitness journey.\nBut Teagan has learned not to worry about the number on the scale, knowing that she needs more food to fuel her intense workouts five to six times a week.\nIt's a lesson she hopes to teach other women through her own Instagram, realising many of her followers were scared to start weightlifting became of weight gain.\n'I try to instill that weight really isn't relevant to this sort of thing,' she said.\n'If you're weightlifting you're going to have to eat more, it shouldn't be something you're scared of. I try and help girls understand that I eat so much to do the workouts as efficiently as I can.'\nThe proof is in Teagan's before and after pictures, and the neuroscience major said one of the best parts of weightlifting has being able to see such visual progress.\n'With weights you see the numbers go up and your body can do things that it couldn't do just a couple of weeks ago,' she said.\nTeagan has made incredible gains since committing solely to weight training, even if the number on the scale is no longer as low as it used to be\n'So it's really easy to map out your progress and that's so motivational in terms of weightlifting.'\nTeagan is happier than ever with her body, which is the strongest it has ever been in her two-year fitness journey.\n'I'm really motivated going to the gym, I've got a routine I really enjoy, and now it's about maintaining my fitness goals and making myself happy and strong.'\nTeagan is now hoping to inspire that same passion for weightlifting in others, advising girls to switch off between leg and upper-body days.\n'A lot of girls are scared of doing upper body because they're scared they're going to get bulky, but that's really difficult,' she said.\nTeagan has learned not to worry about the number on the scale, knowing that she needs more food to fuel her intense workouts five to six times a week\n'And you want to make sure that you're building your whole body at the same time. Don't be scared to strengthen your whole body.'\nTeagan advises starting off with light squats for an easy barbell exercise, and reveals that hip thrusts are her favourite when it comes to an intense way to target glutes.\nAt the end of the day, Teagan wants her Instagram to showcase that you can live a happy and fulfilling lifestyle while 'still seeing progress in your workouts'.\n'You can eat really great food and work out and just be happy,' she said.\n'It doesn't have to be a difficult process and it doesn't have to be something you're constantly worried about or thinking about.'\n'It can be a stress-free life journey. At no point do I see myself stopping because it's a part of my life now, and it's a really happy part of my life.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4446552/19-year-old-food-lover-transforms-body-weights.html"}
