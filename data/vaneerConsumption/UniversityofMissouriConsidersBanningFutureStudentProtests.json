He embarked on a speaking tour with celebrity talent booker All American Speakers and has spoken at the law schools of Duke and Harvard. However, he has recently come under fire after it was revealed that “he’s chronically stolen items, denigrated low-income workers, and made troubling comments about women and drugs.”\nButler, who is considered to be a prominent voice in the national conversation about the African-American struggle, is the son of a railroad executive who earns an annual salary of $8.4 million, according to regulatory filings.\nIn 2015, the protests orchestrated by Butler and the other students who comprised “Concerned Student 1950” culminated with the resignations of University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe and University Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. One of the main reasons for Wolfe’s resignation was a hunger strike conducted by Butler.\nToday is the National day of action! @blacklibco2015 and Million Student March #TheStruggleContinues pic.twitter.com/D3uDLTqdmh — ConcernedStudent1950 (@CS_1950) April 13, 2016\nSince the protests, the university has displayed a much stricter adherence to their rules about occupying campus space. When “Concerned Student 1950” attempted to occupy an administrative building in April, they were quietly told that they would face significant consequences, up to and including expulsion.\nAccording to campus Police Chief Doug Schwandt, he doesn’t foresee another campus protest of a similar magnitude in the near future. “I don’t think that would happen again,” Schwandt said. “I think there’s lessons learned from that. I doubt there would be approval to allow overnight camping again on campus.”\nTom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
