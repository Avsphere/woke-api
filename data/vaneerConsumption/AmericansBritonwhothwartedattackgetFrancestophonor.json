You behaved as soldiers but also as responsible men.\"\nHollande then pinned the Legion of Honor medal on U.S. Airman Spencer Stone, National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos and their longtime friend Anthony Sadler, who subdued the gunman as he moved through the train with an assault rifle strapped to his bare chest. British businessman Chris Norman, who also jumped into the fray, also received the medal.\nThe men showed \"that faced with terror, we have the power to resist. You also gave a lesson in courage, in will, and thus in hope,\" Hollande said.\nSee Tuesday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/aug/24/americans-briton-who-thwarted-attack-get-frances-t/?page=1"}
