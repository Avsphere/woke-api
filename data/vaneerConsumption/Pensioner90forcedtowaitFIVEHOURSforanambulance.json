To my mind a 90-year-old woman who has had a bad fall - five hours is too long to wait.'\nShe was left with a nasty black eye and bump to her head after falling over\nHe added: 'The instructions are not to move them. I overruled that after about an hour because I couldn't leave her on the floor.\n'If I hadn't had done that it would have been five hours waiting with someone lying on the floor with her, holding her head.'\nHe praised the work of care home staff and the paramedics who eventually attended, but said people need to know the strain the system is under.\nHe said: 'People should be aware, even if it does put pressure on the Government or whatever. I honestly thought the response time would be an hour at most for something like that. I just was not aware it was that bad.'\nMrs Wood, a former BT telephonist who celebrates her 91st birthday tomorrow, has suffered from dementia for the last two years.\nNorth West Ambulance Service have apologised to Mrs Wood and admitted that the length of time she had to wait was 'unacceptable'.\nA spokesman said: 'The Trust received a phone call at 2.21pm on Monday to an elderly female who had fallen at a residential home in Ellesmere Port. A paramedic arrived at 5.56pm in a rapid response vehicle, followed by an emergency ambulance at 7.16pm which took the patient to hospital.\n'We are extremely sorry for this delay and completely understand that this is an unacceptable length of time to be waiting for an ambulance.'\nThe fall happened at Mrs Wood's care home, which is just five miles from the nearest hospital\nThe spokesman added: 'Although we would like to get to all of our patients as quickly as possible, unfortunately this is not always possible due to the high demand of 'red' life-threatening calls that we are receiving meaning that the Trust must prioritise in order to attend the most seriously ill first.\n'On the day of this incident, we were also experiencing challenges with handovers at local hospitals which can also contribute to delays. We understand that waiting for an ambulance is very distressing and as soon as one became available, it was dispatched.\n'We hope that the patient is recovering well and wish her all the best. The lady's family has been in touch with our patient experience team which is now in communication with them and is investigating the incident.'\nMrs Wood was released from hospital the following day suffering severe bruising but no serious lasting injuries.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4300482/Pensioner-90-forced-wait-FIVE-HOURS-ambulance.html"}
