As of Saturday evening, the protest guide is among the top stories on the Times‘ web page.\nOne of the highlights of this week’s events includes a “Resist Trump” rally by Occupy Oakland, which promises to be “a family-friendly rally to protest Trump’s first day in office.”\nOccupy Oakland was among the more militant and violent groups within the international Occupy Wall Street movement in the fall of 2011.\nOther protests are specifically billed as “non-violent,” including a march across the pedestrian lanes of the Golden Gate Bridge holding purple fabric as a “symbolic visualization that unity and love are our greatest strengths against hate.”\nThe author of the East Bay Times article, Martha J. Ross, called the President-elect “illegitimate” and “loathsome” on Twitter on Saturday evening:\nWell, Trump as president is by many measures illegitimate and loathsome. Lewis is being truthful while Trump is, as usual, whining. https://t.co/YmagPW6D1W — Martha Ross (@marthajross) January 15, 2017\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
