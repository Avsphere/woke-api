He said, “It’s not a number that we talk about publicly, because it’s a — it’s not a good metric of success, and it’s not an easy number to determine, for all the reasons you would think about. This is a warzone. This is a conflict. Much of our efforts are being conducted from the air. We don’t necessarily have the ability to assess everything on the ground in the way we might like. … And so, I — there isn’t a good number for us to share with you, because we don’t have great confidence in that number.”\n(video via Real Clear Politics)\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/01/03/pentagon-spox-we-dont-have-good-number-of-how-many-isis-fighters-us-has-killed/"}
