The defence is expected to begin next week, when the first witnesses are also likely to testify.\nIf convicted, the maximum penalty is usually up to 30 years in prison. Judges can impose a life sentence \"when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime\", according to the court's guiding statute.\nHundreds of Gbagbo supporters from the country's large diaspora rallied outside the new ICC building on the coast of The Hague, playing drums and chanting slogans in support of the former president.\nOne of the march's organisers, Abel Naki, told AFP that Gbagbo had been \"kidnapped\" and \"deported\" to the ICC.\n\"It reminds us of the years of slavery and colonisation,\" Naki said.\nGbagbo supporters say the French government plotted to oust him and that the ICC has failed to investigate Ouattara's camp for alleged abuses.\n\"My brother was killed by Ouattara's rebels, he's the real criminal. He's the one who should be on trial,\" said 20-year-old Edwige.\nRights groups highlight that crimes were committed by both sides, and that no charges have yet been brought against the Ouattara camp. He was elected to a second term as president in October.\nIvorian Foreign Minister Albert Toikeusse Mabri told AFP during a visit to Ethiopia that after \"10 years of difficulties\" the start of the trial was welcome.\n\"We work for national reconciliation, but all this must be founded on the basis of justice for all... the ICC have started a trial whose conclusions are eagerly awaited,\" he said.\nWatching the trial from a cafe in Abidjan, Michel Gbagbo, son of the former president who was captured with his father in 2011 but released on bail two years later, questioned the impartiality of the court.\n\"The resignation of judges, that witnesses testify under anonymity, that the trial is secret... the fact that president Gbagbo has not been granted provisional release... all that raises questions,\" he said.\nAfrican leaders pursued by the ICC ©K.Tian/A.Bommenel, abm/pld (AFP)\nFormer Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo (left) pictured with his lawyer, Emmanuel Altit, before the start of his trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague on January 28, 2016 ©Peter Dejong (Pool/AFP)\nSupporters of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo attend a live broadcast of his trial on January 28, 2016 in Abidjan ©Sia Kambou (AFP)","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3419469/Gbagbo-trial-uncover-truth-ICC-prosecutor.html"}
