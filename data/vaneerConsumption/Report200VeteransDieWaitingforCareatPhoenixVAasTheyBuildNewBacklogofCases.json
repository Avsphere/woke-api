Shulkin said that the number of patients who wait over 90 days for an appointment went down by 64 percent, and most of the ones that have been waiting aren’t considered urgent.\nDr. Shulkin also said that many veterans received care, but the department hasn’t updated its records.\n“VHA is strongly committed to developing long-term solutions that mitigate risks to the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality and safety of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system,” he said.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/10/05/report-200-veterans-die-waiting-care-phoenix-va-build-new-backlog-cases/"}
