The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nAs Casey Kasem's health has deteriorated over the last month, and his family fought publicly about his medical care and visitation rights, many have wondered why he is 1,200 miles from home in his fragile condition.\nThe 82-year-old radio icon has been diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, and doctors say, he is \"near the end of his life.\"\nOn Friday, after a Kitsap Superior Court hearing in which his wife, Jean Kasem, was found in contempt of court, new details emerged about the five-day road trip in May that involved four states and ended in Silverdale, Washington at the home of a family he's never even met.\nFor nearly a year, Jean Kasem, 59, shut out Casey Kasem's children from his previous marriage and other family members from visiting him or speaking to him on the phone. Jean Kasem hasn't explained why in detail but she has accused the children of wanting to take the radio icon's $80 million fortune.\nAfter not seeing her father for five months, Kerri Kasem, 41, figured out he was at the Berkeley East Convalescent Hospital and visited him with her sister, Julie, 38. On Friday, after the hearing in Washington, Kerri Kasem gave this account about what happened next:\n\"A few hours later, at 2:30 a.m., my stepmother and her daughter—my half sister—went in and took my father from his bed against doctor's orders,\" she said, adding that the hospital security's cameras caught all of it. \"Adult Protective Services was called. Against them, against the nurse's orders, Jean grabbed my father, stole all of the equipment he was attached to, and threw him in the back seat of the car and drove off.\"\nThe family heard from a relative of Jean Kasem's that she was trying to take Casey Kasem out of the country or, at least, onto an Indian reservation, Kerri Kasem said. When Jean Kasem realized her plans had been discovered, she changed her course.\nJean Kasem drove to Las Vegas, where they checked into the Vdara Hotel & Spa. There, they met up with a friend, who drove them to Arizona. But then they returned to Las Vegas, where they flew on a private jet to Washington.\nThe trip lasted five days.\n\"My father is very fragile, very sick,\" Kerri Kasem said. \"During that little trip he took, he incurred a huge, huge bed sore. This is in the doctor's notes. He did not have medication. She was feeding him Ensure through his feeding tube.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/casey-kasems-harrowing-five-day-road-trip-revealed-n124821"}
