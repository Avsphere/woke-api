Or is it some kind of a combination of the two? I think it’s at least some of a concept problem, which longer term is gonna be more challenging, making it harder for investors.”\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/06/13/nyts-stewart-long-term-stability-of-twitter-in-question-after-ceo-steps-down/"}
