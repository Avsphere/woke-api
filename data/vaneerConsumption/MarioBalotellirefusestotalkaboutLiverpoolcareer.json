As you say, I would sign for life here. If the football was at a European level, to live here, to have a new training centre, I cannot think of anywhere better.'\nBalotelli says he would happily stay with Nice for life if they can get to a 'European level'\nWhile Balotelli appears unwilling to criticise the Anfield club, he had no such problem when discussing PSG, saying they have not been nearly as impressive as their title rivals Monaco.\nThe 26-year-old said that PSG have been playing like a group of individuals this season and points to the loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who joined Manchester United last summer, as the reason for their apparent decline.\n'Monaco impress me more than PSG, much more. PSG have good players but they don't play as a team.\nBalotelli has been more impressed with the performances of Monaco than Paris Saint-Germain\nThe loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic left PSG with a group of talented individuals, not a team, he says\n'I have not played against PSG much, I am not saying that they are not a good team. They are in the top places, like us.\n'But without Zlatan they do not play like a team. They can win against anyone, they can lose to anyone,' Balotelli added.\n'Zlatan was the boss, without him it is not the same. Paris is not a team, unlike Monaco. On the contrary, PSG have phenomenons in their team, like Thiago Silva, [Angel] Di Maria. [Edinson] Cavani is a great player but not a phenomenon.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4320080/Mario-Balotelli-refuses-talk-Liverpool-career.html"}
