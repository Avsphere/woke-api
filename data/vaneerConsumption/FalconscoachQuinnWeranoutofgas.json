That’s a hard one in the locker room. No place to put that one mentally for us.”\nThe Falcons finished their season 13-6 after winning the NFC South and making to the Super Bowl as the No. 2 seed from the NFC.\n“I am proud of the fight these guys have,” Quinn said. “The brotherhood that this group has built, it’s as strong as I’ve seen, and that part is real. That connection that these guys have, not only with themselves, but with our city, it’s so strong, I love them, they battled. Tonight we came up short.”\nChannel 2's Fred Blankenship was outside NRG stadium as fans left Super Bowl LI.\nThe Falcons young defense came out strong, but wore down under the relentless passing assault by New England quarterback Tom Brady. It was the first time the Falcons clearly missed their top cornerback Desmond Trufant, who had a season-ending surgery for a torn pectoral muscle.\nThe Patriots controled the ball for 40 minutes, 31 seconds of the 63 minute and 58 second game.\n“Well, I think for sure we ran out of gas some,” Quinn said. “I don’t know what the time of possession was, I didn’t look at that. But I can you how hard these guys battled for it. We knew it was going to come down to the end for sure, and just at the end for them to have the scores back-to-back, this was the difference for sure.”","url":"https://www.ajc.com/sports/football/falcons-coach-quinn-ran-out-gas/YgsBI6pkIR5xKIU4YRFigN/"}
