In the meantime it has been covered with a black tarp.\nOfficials say the village has strict rules regulating easements, and the statue was installed without proper permitting and architectural board approval. The statue previously sat in the courtyard at Lever House in midtown.\nThe village is considering limiting such \"accessory structures\" to a height of 25 feet. A hearing on the issue is set for May 19.According to his website, Hirst has created several versions of the piece, which he says is posed in a way to recall Edgar Degas' \"Little Dancer of Fourteen Years.\"\nHirst said the reference to Degas \"is kind of naughty; she shouldn't really be pregnant. I wanted a feeling of that.\"\nRosen had no comment, according to Newsday.\n--Michael George contributed to this story","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/statue-nude-pregnant-woman-upsets-long-island-community-n99776"}
