As a result, the state revised the regulation, publishing a new version on December 28. The proposed March 1 enforcement date allows for a feedback period.\nThe new rules are comprehensive, likely making it expensive and complex for banks and insurers to achieve compliance. Among other requirements, financial institutions will now have to provide annual reports to the state proving they are compliant, maintain comprehensive audit trails, report any cybersecurity event within 72 hours of occurrence, appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and introduce multifactor authentication for staff accessing internal networks or information systems externally. The last provision is likely designed to help combat breaches of interbank networks such as SWIFT, which has been repeatedly attacked over the last year.\nIf they are implemented, it would present a significant opportunity for regtechs. Regtechs are firms that aim to help other companies more easily achieve compliance. While they may not be able to reduce the burden of appointing a CISO, many specialize in automating the production of reports for regulators, as well as automatically detecting cybersecurity events and alerting the relevant parties. This suggests that financial institutions in New York should consider working with a regtech if the new cybersecurity rules come into force to ease their path to compliance.\nBI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on cybersecurity that details the current landscape for companies in critical infrastructure sectors, as well as how companies can protect their control systems from hackers.\nHere are some of the key points from the report:\nCompanies that operate critical infrastructure sites reported 295 cyber incidents in 2015, up from 245 in 2014.\nHackers are targeting the industrial control systems that operate critical infrastructure because of the enormous damage they can cause by crippling such infrastructure.\nIndustrial control systems typically weren't designed to be connected to the internet, so they weren't built with cybersecurity capabilities to ward off hackers.\nThe hack that caused a blackout in the Ukraine could serve as a blueprint for other hackers that want to target critical infrastructure, helping them succeed in future attackers.\nThe Ukraine hack highlighted the importance of training employees about cybersecurity and placing additional access controls on industrial control systems beyond firewalls.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-delays-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-financial-firms-2016-12"}
