He hired officers and coordinated their schedules, but soon demanded payments from at least three of them in exchange for continuing to assign them more work, authorities said.\n“Those who work within the law enforcement community must maintain the public’s trust and respect,” U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in the news release. “By entering his guilty plea, he acknowledges he violated his oath of office and betrayed those he promised to protect.”\nNo sentencing date was announced.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/fulton-deputy-pleads-guilty-kickbacks-case/dqslTqKwC1QQVxl2Y64HlO/"}
