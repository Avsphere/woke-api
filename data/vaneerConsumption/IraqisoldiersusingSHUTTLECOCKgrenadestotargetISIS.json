But we can hit them up to four times with a single drone.'\nMembers of the Iraqi forces fly a drone to spot positions of ISIS jihadists in the Iraqi city of Mosul\nAn Iraqi soldier carries cases of explosives ahead of a drone flight in Mosul, Iraq\nLieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat of the federal police - who are taking part in the battle alongside a special forces unit - says the new tactic has been very effective.\n'Dozens of terrorists have been killed and wounded. Jihadist movements have been paralysed,' Jawdat says.\nThe weapons are oblong explosive devices tipped by small, rounded grenades with a pin near one end and a netted skirt taken from a badminton shuttlecock on the other.\n'That's so it keeps its balance as it falls,' Muayad says.\nLive footage from the drones can be screened back to the army's commanding officers for them to pinpoint their targets.\nFootage of previous attacks show the grenades falling in slow motion on a group of fighters gathered in front of a mosque and another batch of explosives were dropped on a car.\n'West Mosul is very populated. The roads are very narrow,' Muayad says.\n'The point with these drones is to have very precise strikes to target the terrorists, not the residents.'\n'Day and night, there are always 12 drones in the air, ready to strike.'\nHe refused to say exactly how many drones - which can each carry up to four grenades - the police operate.\nA drone carrying two grenades flying in a test flight by Iraqi forces before it is used to bomb Islamic State fighters\nThe devices have been equipped with an extra battery to prolong their flight time and can now cover a distance of eight kilometres (five miles) up from less than five kilometres (three miles) before.\nInside a ravaged courtyard in a neighbourhood recently recaptured from the jihadists, Captain Baraa Mohammed Jassem from the Rapid Response Division said his elite interior ministry force has 'perfected' drones available commercially so they can drop explosives on the enemy.\n'We took the... idea from the Daesh terrorist organisation,' he said, using an Arabic acronym for IS.\nIS has carried out drone attacks throughout the Mosul operation, with the first record of a deadly attack coming a few days before drive was launched in October, killing two Iraqi Kurdish fighters and wounding two French special forces soldiers.\nOver the past months, the jihadist group has posted footage online filmed by the cameras of its own remote-controlled drones of explosive devices being dropped on armoured vehicles and four-wheel-drive convoys.\nJassem says the new technique has been useful to Iraqi forces, particularly when they retook important public buildings earlier this month.\n'With a night drone, we found and carried out a strike on a group of eight jihadists, hitting them directly,' he said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319902/Iraqi-soldiers-using-SHUTTLECOCK-grenades-target-ISIS.html"}
