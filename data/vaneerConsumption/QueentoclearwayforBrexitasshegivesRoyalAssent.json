Appearing before a committee of MPs, Mr Davis played down the suggestion by Remain MPs that it would be a catastrophe.\nHe said the Government had not conducted a formal economic assessment of the consequences of leaving without a deal. That sparked accusations that ministers were 'driving towards a cliff-edge with a blindfold on'.\nMr Davis said it might be a year before he could offer any figures on what 'no deal' would mean. He added: 'It's not as frightening as some people think, but it's not as simple as some people think.'\nIn Strasbourg, European Council president Donald Tusk accused the UK of threatening behaviour in the build-up to the crunch talks, and said a stalemate would be hugely damaging for Britain.\nMr Tusk said that the EU would not be 'intimated by threats'. He said the remaining 27 members want to 'remain friends', but he also insisted the EU would not cave into pressure from the UK. He added: 'I want to be clear that a 'no deal scenario' would be bad for everyone, but above all for the UK, because it would leave a number of issues unresolved.'\nThe PM has declared her readiness to walk away from negotiations without an agreement, insisting that 'no deal is better than a bad deal'\nWithout a formal trade deal, the UK would fall back on international trade rules set by the World Trade Organisation, which would increase trade tariffs on British exports.\nTheresa May yesterday slapped down Brexit minister Liam Fox after he suggested foreign students should be excluded from the Government's target to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands. The PM's spokesman said Mrs May would continue to resist public and Cabinet pressure to exclude students from the statistics.\nAsked if Dr Fox was speaking for the Government, he replied: 'The Prime Minister's position is clear.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4318542/Queen-clear-way-Brexit-gives-Royal-Assent.html"}
