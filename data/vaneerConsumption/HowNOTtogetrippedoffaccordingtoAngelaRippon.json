People are being targeted, and it has nothing to do with your age or gender.\n'There are clever people out there with a criminal mind who want to get hold of your hard earned cash.\n'What you have to do as an individual is to hang on to it by staying one step ahead of the criminals.'\nWith years of dealing with scams designed to steal your hard-earned money, Angela knows of the clever tactics that criminals employ to steal money, here she reveals her insider tips...\n1. Be wary of what you share online\nAngela it tends to be the younger generation who fall victims to these scams as they share personal details on social media.\nShe explains: 'They are freely giving away information on social media - not realising that it is actually very easy for cyber criminals to access that material.'\nShe points out that with cyber crime, people with the intent can glean enough background information to steal your identity and gain access to bank accounts.\nAlong with Gloria Hunniford (centre) and Julia Somerville (right), the team are on hand to provide the best advice\n2. Always read the small print\n'When it comes to signing contracts, the most important thing is make sure you read the small print,' Angela warns.\nShe recommends asking someone face-to-face to point out what the most important details of a contract as these points should not be buried.\n3. Stand up for your consumer rights\n'Too often people are brow beaten or they're told you don't have any rights,' Angela says.\n'Check your rights. Go to the Citizen's Advice Bureau or trading standards and say \"I don't think this is right\". Get free advice.'\nAngela encourages people to 'stand up if you feel it’s not right' and seek out the correct law to help support your case.\n4. Keep calm\nAngela warns people shouldn't go 'storming in', but to stay calm and collected when registering a complaint.\n'Complain, but complain firmly and politely. You're going to get better results if you do go in all guns blazing.'\nFraudulent scams are a subject close to home for Gloria who had £120,000 stolen from her account - however, luckily she was refunded\nAngela will be helping tackle these issues in the return of the hit BBC show where she investigates audacious scams, consumer conundrums and shoddy customer service - and they take on the banks, identity fraud and sniff out cyber crime.\nAngela returns to front the show alongside co-hosts Gloria Hunniford and Julia Somerville, and the trio travel the length and breadth of the country investigating the issues that have driven desperate consumers to contact the show.\nThe Rip Off Britain team are able to make reparations along the way, revisiting people they have helped but Angela will not be resting just yet.\nShe adds: 'People are still being ripped off and scammed. Criminals are developing along with technology.'\nRip Off Britain will air on weekday mornings, BBC One, at 9.15am between 1st – 12th May, followed by a special week of Live programmes from Monday 15th May at the same time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4441108/How-NOT-ripped-according-Angela-Rippon.html"}
