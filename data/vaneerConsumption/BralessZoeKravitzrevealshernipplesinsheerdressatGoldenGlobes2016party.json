The actress, model and musician showed off her enviable legs and slender figure in the gorgeous gown\nEdgy as ever: The daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet teamed her racy look with simple accessories, including barely-there heels and a classic black clutch\nThe outspoken star recently discussed how she reacts to people's opinions about her career, telling Wonderland magazine: 'I seriously do not give a s***.'\nSpeaking about her triple-threat career, she added: 'That was the way the entertainment industry started, if you really think about it.\n'You used to have to be a triple threat to survive in Hollywood. You know, a Gene Kelly, or a Julie Andrews.'\nMeanwhile, Zoe looked ready to party it up along with a handful of other stars who attended the InStyle bash on Sunday night, including Kate Hudson, Bella Thorne, Nina Dobrev, Vanessa Hudgens and Best Actress winner Brie Larson.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3393612/Braless-Zoe-Kravitz-reveals-nipples-seriously-sexy-sheer-dress-Golden-Globes-afterparty.html"}
