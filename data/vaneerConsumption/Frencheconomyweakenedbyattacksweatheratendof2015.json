There was a marked 0.9 percent decrease in household spending during the period.\nUnemployment has hovered around 10 percent since 2009 in France, and the Socialist government has repeatedly promised to increase growth and get more people working by easing labor rules and taxes.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422416/French-economy-weakened-attacks-weather-end-2015.html"}
