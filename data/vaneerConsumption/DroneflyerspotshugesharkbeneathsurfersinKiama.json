You got a mobile phone?'\nThe drone enthusiast, who was about 300 metres away from the surfers, told the Illawara Mercury that he ran down the beach to try to alert them.\n'I could see it with my own eyes, circling the area,' he said. 'The first thing I thought about was, \"how can I let these guys know?\"\nDavid Finlay was flying his drone at Surf Beach in Kiama, New South Wales, on Monday when he spotted the huge beast below the surface of the water\nHe said he was using his drone to watch surfers from above when he suddenly saw the large shark swimming below three people in the water\n'I ran down the beach and tried to find a lifeguard, but of course if was after lifeguard hours.\n'I let some of the surfers know who were coming out of the water. But I was reassured by the time I got down there. I’d monitored the shark the whole time I’d been running, and it continued to move away from the surfers.'\nThe creature appears to be a grey nurse shark, which rarely attack humans and have never been known to kill people.\nA shark sighting earlier that day had closed the beach but it was reopened after it could not be found.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446330/Drone-flyer-spots-huge-shark-beneath-surfers-Kiama-NSW.html"}
