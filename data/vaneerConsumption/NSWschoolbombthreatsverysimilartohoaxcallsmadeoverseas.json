They were praised for doing a great job to sing/stay together.\n'We have explained that lots of school had phone calls to say they weren't safe'.\nSome school officials said the message appeared pre-recorded.\nThe Herald Sun quoted Cowes Primary assistant principal Rod McKenzie saying: 'I understand it was a pre-recorded message, a robot or computerised message.'\nNSW police confirmed there were operations underway at various sites across the state\nStudents march to the oval at Penrith High School after threats were made at the school\nA police car was spotted outside St Monica's primary school in Parramatta\nInvestigators have vowed to bring the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice, warning making such threats is considered a serious criminal offence.\n'Every effort will be made to identify the person or persons responsible,' police in New South Wales said.\nThe NSW Education Department said each school is taking 'precautionary measures to ensure the safety of its students'.\nA spokesman said: 'No students are in danger.
