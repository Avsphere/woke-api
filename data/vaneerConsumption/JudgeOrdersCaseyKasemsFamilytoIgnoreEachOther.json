The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nRadio icon Casey Kasem's health took a turn for the worse late Wednesday, and so did the battle in his family over visitation rights.\nThe 82-year-old radio star's blood pressure plummeted, prompting doctors Wednesday night to call in the family. But a few hours later, his wife, Jean Kasem, 59, was escorted out of St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington, by security after causing a scene with her loud sobbing, two sources close to the family told NBC News. Kasem was told she could stay if she calmed down, but she did not.\nOn Thursday, Jean Kasem and her lawyers asked Kitsap Superior Court Judge Jennifer Forbes to issue an order granting Jean Kasem visitation rights. Forbes complied, ordering that \"time with Mr. Kasem shall be shared by both sides of the family, coordinated via a neutral third party,\" according to the document obtained by NBC News. The judge also ordered that at all times, while on hospital property, \"neither side will communicate with the other.\"\nBecause \"at such time it appears that Mr. Kasem may be in his final hours, both sides should be allowed to visit Mr. Kasem at the same time,\" Forbes concluded.\nA hospital spokesperson on Thursday issued a statement saying Casey Kasem is in critical condition and being treated for bed sores and is receiving blood pressure support medication.\n\"He is alert, appears comfortable at this time,\" according to the statement.\nFor nearly a year, Jean Kasem has shut out her husband's three children from another marriage and other relatives from visiting him or talking to him on the phone. Although Jean Kasem hasn't explained why she has taken such drastic actions, she has accused his children of wanting his $80 million fortune.\nOn May 6, she removed him from a facility in Santa Monica, California, and took him to Washington to stay at a friend's house. His daughter Kerri Kasem, who has been appointed conservator over his health care, had him hospitalized Sunday.\nOn Thursday, Kasem's younger brother, Mouner, said it breaks his heart to know that Casey Kasem \"did not get the care he deserves for the man that he is. It's been really hard seeing him the way he is.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/judge-orders-casey-kasems-family-ignore-each-other-n123996"}
