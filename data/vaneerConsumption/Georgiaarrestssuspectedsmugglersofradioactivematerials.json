It didn't say when the arrest was made or give any other details.\nCesium-137, a byproduct of nuclear reactors, is used for various medical and industrial purposes.\nGeorgia and some other ex-Soviet nations have seen numerous attempts at contraband trade in radioactive substances. There have been fears that if such materials fall in the hands of extremists, they could be used in a \"dirty bomb,\" a device intended to contaminate large areas using conventional explosives.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3394328/Georgia-arrests-suspected-smugglers-radioactive-materials.html"}
