It was their Orange Ginger Fizz. I couldn’t place what made the fizz in the drink. Also, it appears it had allspice or nutmeg as a finish. Please see if you can get the recipe. Thanks. — Lynn Gamble, Columbus, Georgia\nThe fizz comes from ginger beer and the folks at Wahoo were happy to share the recipe. Another key ingredient is Verdant Kitchen Ginger Syrup, available in the shop at Wahoo Wine & Provisions and other retailers around metro Atlanta.\nWahoo Grill, 1042 W.
