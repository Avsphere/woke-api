It starts in the Bible.”\nThe co-host then dismissed the show’s other panelists, who suggested Clinton’s ongoing email scandal might be partially responsible for Clinton’s being viewed as dishonest or untrustworthy.\nRaven-Symoné said, “She’s explained many times what the situation was and why they’re coming after her … I think that’s a problem; get over it already.”\nClinton was asked about a possible indictment as the result of a federal investigation on Wednesday at CNN’s Democratic presidential debate.\nUnivision’s Jorge Ramos asked the candidate if she will drop out of the race if she is indicted.\nClinton responded: “Oh, that’s not going to happen. I’m not even answering that question.”\nWatch a clip from The View below:","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/03/10/the-view-raven-symone-blames-bible-voters-distrust-hillary-clinton/"}
