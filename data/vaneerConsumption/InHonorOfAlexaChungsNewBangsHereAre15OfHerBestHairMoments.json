For some reason, pretending that I have my own Mulberry bag and a British accent just gives me that extra boost of confidence I need. What can I say? Some people work out. I pretend I'm a hip, modern-day fashion icon. Judge me. Chung recently debuted her freshly-cut hair, complete with the return of bangs, and as I have been of every other hairstyle she's every had, I am jealous.\nChung manages to make the most simple, laid back hairstyles seem effortlessly chic — a look that I am never able to perfectly achieve. Through color changes, bangs/no bangs, up dos and red carpet styles, Alexa Chung's hair pretty much always looks cooler than everyone else's. And given that she's an adult who is pulling off bangs in a way that amazingly manages not to say \"I tried this trend on a whim and I'm sort of regretting it, but I'm making the best of it, ok?\" we should all be at least a little impressed.\nIn celebration of Alexa Chung, the Queen of Awesome Hair (I just made up that title, if any of you are wondering), here are fifteen of her best hair moments.\n1. The New Bangs!\nTristan Fewings/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nHere they are. They're adorable and oh-so-Alexa. You're speaking in a British accent now too, right? No? Ok.\n2. Pulled Back\nGareth Cattermole/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nChung looks like the perfect mixture of bohemian and high-fashion with her hair pulled back like this, letting just a few wisps fall around her face. Combined with the dress' neckline, this is one of my favorite of her hairstyles.\n3. Dark and Pinned Back\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nI love that she makes hairstyles that would make me look very similar to when I did in the 2nd grade and I thought barrettes could disguise the fact that I hated showering...look somehow very cool. It's impressive.\n4. Vintage Glam\nStuart C. Wilson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nI just squealed. That's how much I love this look.\n5. Ponytail\nIan Gavan/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nI don't know about you, but my ponytails never look this cool. Never.\n6. Full Bangs\nDave Kotinsky/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nA little bang, a lot of bang — it doesn't matter. She makes all of it look good.\n7. Short and Sleek\nLarry Busacca/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nHow perfect is this style with the dress? The woman knows how to put together a whole look.\n8. Almost, Sort Of A Little Bit Red\nMike Coppola/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nI love when Alexa has some red tones in her hair. It lightens everything up and suits her complexion so well.\n9. Side-Swept Bang\nJason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nThis may actually be my favorite variation of Alexa bangs. And given that I tend to associate side-swept bangs with when I brought a picture of a heavily-banged Carrie Underwood to the hairdresser in 2008 and asked for the same thing (why?), that's a pretty big deal.\n10. Ombre-Ish\nStuart Wilson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nHonestly, she was probably the one who started the whole ombre thing.\n11. With A Flower Crown\nStephen Lovekin/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nAlexa Chung wearing a flower crown. It's a fashion girl's dream.\n12. Tousled Bob\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nI feel like Alexa Chung saw the trendiness of the lob coming before anyone else.\n13. Side Part\nMark Metcalfe/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nAlexa rarely rocks a side part, but when she does, it's glorious.\n14. SUPER Bob\nMichael Buckner/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nThis is a more intense look, but I think it works. Because it's Alexa Chung.\n15. Blunt, Ombre Super Bob\nGareth Cattermole/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nAnother intense look...and yes, that's a little bit of blonde you see. While I prefer Alexa's newer looks, this one still suits her. As everything does.\nImages: Getty Image (15)","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35857-in-honor-of-alexa-chungs-new-bangs-here-are-15-of-her-best-hair-moments"}
