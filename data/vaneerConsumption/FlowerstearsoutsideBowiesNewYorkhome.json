We did feel that on the photos he looked gaunt. We were all concerned but you never think that... you think it will go on forever.\n\"I saw him perform many times, the first time at Madison Square Garden. I was blown away,\" she said.\nBowie's death came as a shock just two days after he released his 25th album, capping one of the most influential and innovative pop careers of all time.\n\"Au revoir David,\" said the message from Bagieu on a bouquet placed next to the front door of the building.\n\"Thank you David, may the Gods bless us all,\" read another note left with a bunch of white roses and a candle.\nGeorgina Berrozpe, 45, from Spain who lives in the neighborhood, said she had come to bid farewell to an artist who had fascinated her since childhood.\nShe said she had been listening to his music for an hour since learning of his death.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3394374/Flowers-tears-outside-Bowies-New-York-home.html"}
