(AP Photo/Michel Euler)\nBlanc wrote that the club \"had the unpleasant surprise\" to find out that M.I.A appeared twice wearing the PSG shirt \"bearing the very easily recognizable logo Paris Saint-Germain and our sponsors' brands (Nike and QNB), and the brand of our sponsor Emirates.\"\nThe PSG communication department told The Associated Press on Monday it wants to protect its image as well as its sponsors and says no legal action has been taken so far.\nBlanc explained in his letter that the club did not understand why it was associated with a denunciation of the migrants' treatment in their journey across the sea toward Europe.\n\"This association is all the more hard to understand that nothing in our activities and in our daily initiatives suggests we have anything to do with the problems highlighted by M.I.A. \" Blanc wrote.\nBlanc noted that the French champions made a donation of 1 million euros ($1.12 million) to the United Nations' refugee agency and a French non-profit association to help relieve the migrant crisis last September.\n\"We consider that the use of our brand and image in a video clip denouncing the treatment of refugees is a source of discredit for our club and distorts its public communication policy,\" Blanc added.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3393879/PSG-asks-rap-artist-MIA-stop-using-brand-sponsors.html"}
