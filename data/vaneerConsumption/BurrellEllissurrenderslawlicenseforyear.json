He could be paroled in March, according to the State Board of Pardons and Paroles.\nAccording to the order released Monday, Ellis acknowledged that a felon cannot practice law, and he will be disbarred if his felony conviction is upheld.\n“The court hereby accepts the voluntary petition and directs that W. Burrell Ellis, Jr. be suspended from the practice of law in this state until further order of this court,” the order said.\nHis appeal is pending.\nEllis practiced real estate law before he was elected in 2008 to the first of two terms leading DeKalb County.\nHe retains the title of chief executive officer because he has not resigned the job and he can’t be permanently removed until all his appeals have failed. The governor appointed Lee May interim CEO when Ellis was suspended in July 2013 after he was indicted.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/burrell-ellis-surrenders-law-license-for-year/RYCHJ2nDZGws0TZR0gq1pI/"}
