Your fault, live with it.'\nMr Vine was cycling in Kensington when the car pulled out in front of him after he emerged from behind a bus\nBBC presenter and keen cyclist Jeremy Vine (pictured) has uploaded a video of a new road rage incident\nBut Ross Phillips defended the journalist and added: 'Bus had stopped to avoid blocking the junction but inside lane is clear so traffic should proceed, cars turning right do not have priority.'\nToby Edwards said: 'Bus blocking view of car. Car should've given way to cyclist. Cyclist was filtering through queuing traffic, which is perfectly legal.'\nSam Andrews added: 'I personally would have let the car go, but the abuse is not right!'\nIn February, Pearson was convicted at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court of driving without reasonable consideration for other road users and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.\nShe was released on bail and will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court at a date yet to be set.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447540/F-mum-BBC-s-Jeremy-Vine-new-road-rage-storm.html"}
