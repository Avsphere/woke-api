Though she was quick to tell family and close friends, they warned her to keep the news a secret from the public.\n'Most responded with \"Oh, be careful!\" or \"Don't share this news! What if....\" and I feel like my emotions went from joyous and excited to petrified and fearful of losing him/her,' she said.

I was on a mission to be pregnant again. I wanted to fill that void inside me.'\nAnd they didn't just try — they employed 'tricks' too, and used 'an obnoxious amount of early pregnancy tests' each month.\nOn December 20, she used a digital pregnancy test and found out she was expecting.\n'This news couldn't have come on a better day. I was due to have our sweet first born son, Johnathan, on December 20th,' she said. 'As I sat there crying staring at a plastic device I just peed on I told our little Johnny how much I love him and will always love him... and I thanked him for precious gift he gave us.\n'Because we ended up finding out on Johnny's due date I took it as a sign from our sweet boy in heaven. It was like this pregnancy was a gift from big brother and a message to mommy and daddy to be happy for the holidays.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4447834/Jamie-Otis-Doug-Hehner-reveal-having-girl.html"}
