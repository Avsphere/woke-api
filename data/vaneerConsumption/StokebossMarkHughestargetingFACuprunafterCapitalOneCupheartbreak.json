'There's only so many competitions we can win and the FA Cup now is the only one realistically - so why wouldn't you have a go? We are certainly of that mindset.\n'It is a competition that was very good to me as a player and as a manager I'd love to have success in it.'\nStoke's Premier League rivals Palace - currently 11th in the table, two places and two points worse off than the Potters - could give a debut to Emmanuel Adebayor on Saturday after he joined them this week on a deal to the end of the season.\nPeter Crouch (pictured) and Marc Muniesa both saw their penalties saved by Simon Mignolet\nEmmanuel Adebayor in training action during his time at Manchester City under then boss Mark Hughes\nAdebayor last played a competitive match in May, the striker having been a free agent since his release from his contract with Tottenham in September.\nThe 31-year-old former Arsenal, Manchester City and Real Madrid man has a reputation for being problematic for the managers he is under.\nBut Hughes, who signed Adebayor for City, has praised the Togolese player and backed him to shine for Palace.\n'He is a great player,' Hughes said. 'If you get him going and on fire, then he is a real handful.\n'I had him at Man City. For whatever reason he seems to court a little bit of bad publicity about himself as a person and as a player, but I never really experienced it - I enjoyed working with him.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3423075/Stoke-boss-Mark-Hughes-targeting-FA-Cup-run-Capital-One-Cup-heartbreak.html"}
