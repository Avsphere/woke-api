The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nChicago’s latest attraction is TILT, a wall of windows that tilt out more than 1,000 feet in the air from the observation room atop the iconic John Hancock building.\nThe attraction comes five years after Willis Tower -- formerly Sears Tower -- unveiled its glass “Ledge.”\nTILT is an enclosed, clear rectangular box that holds up to eight people at a time. Once in place, the box tilts to a 30-degree angle, giving brave souls a near bird’s eye view of the Windy City – and possibly vertigo.\nCheck out the views that defy gravity tonight on NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams.
