While the American Horror co-stars have not officially said they have reconciled, in recent months they have been seen together a lot and just last week Evan posted a video on Instagram mentioning he had a girlfriend\nThe star posted a quick video from the Bachelor - which is a favourite show of Emma's - of one of the women vying for Ben Higgins' heart looking as though she's screaming.\nEvan wrote: 'How I feel on the inside when my girlfriend \"forces\" me to watch The Bachelor.'\nWhile he did not say the girlfriend was his former fiancee, with all the time the pair have spent together of late it seems very likely they are back to being boyfriend and girlfriend at the very least.\nCasually sweet: For their lunch, the petite star wore a dark flowing dress with a fitted cardigan and sneakers\nThe pair in started dating in 2012 and became engaged in 2013 but they certainly had a rocky road, that saw Emma arrested for domestic assault during their romance.\nTheir lunch date comes just a month after Emma said she was 'over' the split in an interview with Allure Magazine.\nShe told the January issue she got over their broken engagement by buying new jewellery.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3423389/Emma-Roberts-gets-close-ex-Evan-Peters-devours-burger-lunch-just-days-said-girlfriend-Instagram.html"}
