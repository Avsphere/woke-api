It is not just Twickenham, it is the other venues as well.\n'Friday nights have always been an issue in so far as there tend to be security logistic issues that people have quoted in the past and then there are issues around people worrying around hospitality and also in England, in particular, people have reasonable distances to travel to get to the games.\n'But it has been a success. Friday nights have been a success in Paris and in Wales so I don't see why it wouldn't be a success anywhere else.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-3422721/Twickenham-host-Six-Nations-games-Friday-nights-World-Cup-success.html"}
