The hallway which has a tiled floor and boasts original features is pictured above\nInvestment: The new owner will need to spend millions to restore the estate to its former glory but once completed, it could be worth more than £10million\nBy the time Victoria was on the throne, the monarch and husband Prince Albert tried to buy Norris Castle but the-then owner, newspaper tycoon Thomas Bell, wanted too much money for estate so they built Osborne House nearby instead.\nThe Duke of Bedford later bought Norris Castle and would frequently play host to Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany. The German stayed so often that he had his own bath installed - which remains today.\nIt was announced in August the Grade II listed estate would be put up for sale for the first time in 60 years with a tantalising guide price of just £1 million.\nDozens of deep-pocketed potential buyers jumped in their helicopters to visit the 26,000 sq/ft mansion on the Isle of Wight.\nAs a result of huge interest, there was a bidding battle and the castle ended up selling for a staggering £4.7 million.\nIt is now set to be turned into a five-star resort.\nEstate agents Knight Frank would not discuss the castle, but independent buying agent Henry Pryor praised them for achieving the bumper price.\nHe said: 'Getting people to consider the location will have been the biggest challenge so the selling agents sensible made the asking price simply too attractive not to.\n'This is a great example of what good marketing can achieve and demonstrates why an eBay style listing service is still some way off taking over from the best estate agents.\nGuest of honour: The castle was later bought by the Duke of Bedford and the Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany became such a frequent visitor that he had his own bath installed\nQueen Victoria (pictured left, in her coronation portrait in 1838 and right, in the 1890s) thought the estate was too expensive 150 years ago, so she and husband Prince Albert opted to build Osborne House nearby instead\nSpecial: A circular drawing room (pictured) and a library both have original wooden bookshelves designed by Wyatt and period fireplaces\nMassive: Originally built in 1799, the estate boasts 26,000 square feet of living space, 225 acres of land and a mile of waterfront\nCastle with a view: It was built by James Wyatt - the man behind Windsor Castle - in 1799 for Lord Henry Seymour. Pictured: a large farmhouse on the estat with castellated walls designed to form an imitation medieval castle\n'You need to get the high rollers to view the property and then just like more modest homes the house must do its bit.\n'Unique homes need clever marketing and the best marketing can yield impressive results. My own client sadly wasn't able to compete but someone has bagged themselves a great project even though they appear to have paid a lot more than was originally asked.\n'A guide price is just the bait on the hook. When fishing for big game you need attractive bait and the agents in this sale selected a very special lure.'\nThe sale, which went through in the middle of December, was one of the largest of 2015 outside of London and the Home Counties.\nWhen it went onto the market, James Crawford, a partner in the country department at Knight Frank called Norris Castle 'a masterpiece, with phenomenal views, history and potential'.\nHe added: 'I have not seen anything like this in the 27 years I have been an estate agent.\n'Restoring it will be a big undertaking, but arguably it will be the best house of its type in the south of England.\n'The castle was built by Wyatt and the gardens were done by Repton. In footballing terms, they are the ultimate strike partnership - the best of the best.'\nMr Crawford believes the estate will be worth in excess of £10 million when the work is completed.\nOn top of the main home, there is a large farmhouse with castellated walls designed to form an imitation medieval castle.\nIt also has a four bedroom house, two three bedroom cottages and a studio.There is a two-bedroom lodge, a beach-fronting folly and more than one mile of sea frontage with various beaches.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423004/Castle-Victoria-tried-buy-Kaiser-Wilhelm-used-stay-visited-England-sold-4-7million.html"}
