Boian continued, “On Wednesday we did. We turned it right over to the FBI.”\nNotably absent from Boian’s description of the handover was any involvement by Hillary Clinton or her staff. Last Tuesday, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill released a statement which framed the handover as a decision made by Clinton of her own initiative. “She directed her team to give her email server that was used during her tenure as Secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails already provided to the State Department,” the statement from Hillary’s spokesman Nick Merrill read in part.\nWhen Merrill was asked by the Washington Post whether the FBI had asked for the server before she “directed” it be turned over, he declined to answer the question. The FBI also refused to discuss the nature of the handover.\nThere appears to have been a short-term benefit to the description offered by the Clinton campaign. Instead of headlines like, “FBI seizes Hillary’s email server,” the initial coverage followed the tone of Merrill’s statement. For instance, the first headline from the AP read, “Clinton campaign says she directs her team to give personal email server to Justice Department.”\nAccording to Boian, the Platte River spokesman, Hillary’s server has been in a New Jersey data center from June of 2013, when the company took possession of it, until last week when the FBI collected it from them. The FBI gave Platte River receipts after it was seized.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/08/20/platte-river-networks-fbi-asked-us-to-turn-over-hillary-clinton-email-server/"}
