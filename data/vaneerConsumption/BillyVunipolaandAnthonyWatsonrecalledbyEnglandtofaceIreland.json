The intensity of training has been good. It‚Äôs going to be quite an occasion in Dublin so we understand we have to be prepared emotionally, physically and mentally.\n‚ÄúThe mood in camp has been positive. We‚Äôre very excited ahead of what is a huge opportunity for the players. You sense the intensity has stepped up - it definitely has in training.‚Äù\nThe build up to the climax to the 2017 Six Nations has seen reports emerge of an approach made by England to world champions New Zealand with the aim of arranging a fixture this autumn.\nIt was would be a seismic showdown between the world‚Äôs top two teams, but Jones refuses to look beyond an Ireland side who have fallen far short of expectations this year.\n‚ÄúThe message to the players has been quite simple ‚Äì we‚Äôre playing Ireland on Saturday and that is the only thing that counts,‚Äù the Australian said.\n‚ÄúWe are focusing on preparing well, the only thing we can control is our preparation. Ireland not having anything to play for means they have the courage to fail which frees them up mentally.\n‚ÄúWe are a little bit vulnerable because we have already been crowned champions and we had a big win against Scotland, so for us it‚Äôs about getting the right mind-set for the game.‚Äù","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4319558/Billy-Vunipola-Anthony-Watson-recalled-England-face-Ireland.html"}
