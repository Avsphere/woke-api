In his years with us, Scott has proven to be our resident grammarian in Sports. He’s a stickler for meeting Post standards for fairness, accuracy and clarity, and for enforcing The Post stylebook. He’s a wonderful headline writer and a good teacher, a skill he also employs as track coach at Churchill High School in Potomac. He was named All-Met coach of the year by The Post in 2007.\nScott is a graduate of the University of Maryland with a degree in journalism. He’s also worked as deputy sports editor at the Washington Times and taught writing classes to high school students.\nPlease join me in congratulating Scott.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2018/08/20/scott-silverstein-becomes-sports-copy-chief/"}
