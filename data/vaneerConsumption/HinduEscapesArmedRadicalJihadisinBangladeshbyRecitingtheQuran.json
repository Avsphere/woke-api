Emerging from the appalling, bloody debris are stories of immense courage. There are also unanswered questions about what happened to some of those who died.\nOne of the survivors, Sarker, is identified as one of the chefs at the Holey Artisan Bakery and O’Kitchen restaurant where the jihadists shot and hacked 29 people to death and wounded at least 40 others on July 1, 2016, just before the Islamic festival of Eid that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n“I crawled on my hands and knees over dead bodies and blood,” Sarker tells BBC.\nThe jihadists asked Sarker to cook for them.\n“Perhaps [one of the militants] was suspicious,” notes BBC. “He asked Sarker to recite from the Koran. Sarker calmly carried on frying sea bass. And he recited Koranic verses.”\nSarker points out, “All my life I’ve had Muslim friends, so I knew some Surah [chapters of the Koran]. But I was so frightened. I was thinking – would I satisfy him?”\nThe chef served the food to the Muslim hostages and to the staff before dawn, in accordance with the Islamic tradition during Ramadan.\n“I was so scared, when I ate I couldn’t swallow the food. But I thought if I didn’t eat, they would think I wasn’t going to fast the following day, and then they would guess I wasn’t Muslim,” says Sarker.\nThe siege on the Dhaka restaurant ended soon after sunrise with authorities killing the five jihadists as well as rescuing Sarker and his surviving colleagues.\nAlthough the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack, some Bangladesh officials have expressed doubt that the terrorist group carried out the massacre, saying instead that the jihadists are likely linked to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), one of the most prominent Islamic extremist groups in the country.\nJMB is affiliated with ISIS rival al-Qaeda.\nBoth terrorist groups, ISIS and al-Qaeda, have been associated with a spate of attacks in Bangladesh over the past two years, often involving jihadists using machetes, against individuals including writers, bloggers, academics, activists, liberals, atheists, foreigners, gays, and religious minorities.\n“Life will never be the same for this unassuming young chef,” reports BBC, referring to Sarker. “He is working again, but still traumatized by that hellish night.”\n“I don’t see any future. I can’t sleep properly,” reveals the Hindu survivor. “Whenever I’m alone and I think of that night, I just can’t do anything – I feel terrified.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/13/bangladesh-attack-hindu-escapes-armed-radical-jihadis-reciting-quran/"}
