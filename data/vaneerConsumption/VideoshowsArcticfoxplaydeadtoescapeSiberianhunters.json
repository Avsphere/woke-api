All animals deserve life,' while others slammed the hunters for trapping it in the first place.\nOthers questioned how the hunters did not realise the fox was still alive and a user called 'NeoSanktum' said: 'How can you not feel the warmth and heartbeat?'\nArctic foxes are hunted for their high quality fur pelts, which can be sold for hundreds of pounds to make coats and accessories.\nIt is not considered an endangered species worldwide, with several thousand in the wild, but there are some specific areas in which their numbers are dwindling due to hunting, particularly in Scandinavia.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393760/Siberian-hunters-fooled-Arctic-fox-plays-dead-escape-trap.html"}
