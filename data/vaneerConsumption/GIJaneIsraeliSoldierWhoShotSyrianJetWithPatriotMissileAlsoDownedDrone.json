Two mortar shells from Syria, which the army said was spillover from fighting near the border, landed in the Sea of Galilee, the army said.\nThe jet took off from the T-4 airbase near Homs, the IDF said. The airbase has been targeted at least twice in the recent past by Israel and has been used as a command center for Iran’s drone operations.\nOn Tuesday, Assad forces reached the border fence, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to slam the breach of Israeli territory as a “blatant violation” of the 1974 agreement that established a UN peacekeeping buffer zone between Israel and Syria.\n“Our air defense systems identified a Syrian Air Force jet that took off from the T-4 Syrian Air Force base and penetrated Israeli airspace,” Netanyahu said.\n“I have reiterated and made clear that we will not accept any such violation. We will not accept any such penetration of or spillover into our territory, neither on the ground nor from the air,” he added.\nThe Islamic State released footage on Wednesday allegedly showing the Syrian fighter jet shot down by Israel. According to Syrian officials, IS fighters captured the body of one of the pilots.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2018/07/25/gi-jane-soldier-who-shot-syrian-jet-with-patriot-missile-also-downed-drone/"}
