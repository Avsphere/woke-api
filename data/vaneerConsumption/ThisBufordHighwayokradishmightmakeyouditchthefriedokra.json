The okra, sauteed to a soft crisp, is tossed, along with slivers of red onion and red pepper, in a sauce of Malaysian shrimp paste, oil and chili paste. It's just spicy enough, though if your tastes run to the mild, you can cool things off with the side of white rice that accompanies the meal.\nIt might go against all you believe in to have a vegetable dish serve as your dinner entree, but the sambal okra more than holds its own, and you might even have enough left over for lunch the next day.\nIt'll all make you forget about the fried okra you normally order at your local meat-and-three. For a little while, at least.\nRead about some of our other favorite dishes from Atlanta restaurants\nClick here to read the AJCâ€™s Ultimate Guide to Brunch in Atlanta\nClick here to read about dining in Atlanta around the clock\nRead more stories like this by liking Atlanta Restaurant Scene on Facebook, following @ATLDiningNews on Twitter.
