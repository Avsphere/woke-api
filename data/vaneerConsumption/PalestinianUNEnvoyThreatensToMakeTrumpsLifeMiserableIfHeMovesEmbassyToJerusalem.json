Nevertheless, he warned Trump, “Maybe I can’t have resolutions in the Security Council but I can make their lives miserable everyday with precipitating a veto on my admission as a member state.”\nMansour warned that he would “reopen the whole Pandora’s Box” of verdicts in the International Criminal Court of Justice on the issue of Israel’s security fence and the settlements.\nHe added that “it is illegal to defy Security Council resolutions that the U.S. is party to that the unilateral action by Israel annexing East Jerusalem is illegal and it is null and void. If the U.S. administration wants to defy international law they are doing something illegal.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/11/14/palestinian-un-envoy-threatens-to-make-trumps-life-miserable-if-he-moves-embassy-to-jerusalem/"}
