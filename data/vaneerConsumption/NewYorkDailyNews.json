We don't use a convoluted mathematical or artificial intelligence model, but instead have regular people representing the broad spectrum of Americans blindly rate the bias of articles. That produces a fair, verifiable bias rating.\nThis media bias rating was determined using the following levels of bias verification.\nBasis of Rating: Blind Survey\nThird Party Data Wikipedia\n0 Community Feedback\n0 Editorial Review\n1 Secondary Research\nConfidence Level: Low or Initial Rating\nUnless otherwise noted, this bias rating refers only to news articles on their web site, not from opinion pieces or what is broadcasted on TV or radio. The opinion writers from the same media source may have different bias ratings, so individual writers often are rated separately.","url":"https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-daily-news"}
