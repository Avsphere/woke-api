She told Stabile, that he is planning on using taxpayer funds to pay not only himself, but a group of appointed auditors to monitor the films. “Weinstein has waged a 10-year personal crusade against the adult industry and now wants tax payers to pay him to control it. I’m speechless,” she said.\nThis isn’t Weinstein’s first time trying to monitor the Adult Film Industry says Stabile. A bill last year, AB1576, was defeated in the state legislature. Moreover, he pointed out that since 2004 there has not been a HIV transmission on a regulated adult film set. The industry mandates that performers test every two weeks for a comprehensive examination of STIs, including HIV.\nThe Free Speech Coalition reported on Thursday that the proposed ballot measure would redirect millions of dollars that would otherwise go to HIV care and prevention to fund Weinstein’s “personal obsession” with the porn industry.\nThe legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government estimate that the measure would potentially reduce state and local tax revenue of millions or tens of millions of dollars per year. Moreover it would likely cost a few million dollars annually to administer the law.\nKamala Harris the Attorney General of California summarized the ballot measure as the following:","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2015/03/20/measure-calls-for-taxpayer-funded-porn-czar-to-monitor-condom-usage/"}
