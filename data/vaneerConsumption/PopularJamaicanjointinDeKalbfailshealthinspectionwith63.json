Anything below 70 is considered failing.\nOther violations include ready-to-eat okra sitting on top of raw beef, unlabeled chemical or toxic materials found in the main kitchen and bar area and various employee personal items stored with items for customers throughout the facility. An employee's purse was also said to be plopped on the food preparation area.\nREAD|Employee touched trash can, food during failed inspection in DeKalb\nALSO|Flies get Korean spot in DeKalb failing health score\nManager Ben Cross refuted much of the report and said he is dedicated to providing customers a clean eating environment.\n“We take our cleaning seriously,” he said.\nCross said the dirty sink was likely due to an employee washing their hands after handling raw chicken. He also denied any cooked okra laying on raw beef, insisting he had two fridges — one for alcohol and the other for seafood — neither of which store cooked products.\nCross said he did not see any ants, but said they likely came in through the sink.\n“Every week we have pest control companies come out,” he said. “So we do (take) preventative measures.”\nAs for the employee sitting her purse on the food prep area, Cross said she was on her way out when the inspector called her back in to assist with a task. When the employee reentered the kitchen, she sat her purse on the prep area. Cross said there is an area for employees to place their belongings.\nWhile Cross said the restaurant is “one of the best when comes to cleanliness,” he acknowledged there is always room for improvement.\nThe restaurant has emphasized to employees they cannot have cellphones in work areas due to the likelihood of germs spreading, Cross said. He also keeps a handbook of the health codes for employees to read and then has them sign a contract saying they understand the regulations.\n“I do take pride in maintaining a good score,” Cross said.\nThe restaurant received an 82 on an inspection in 2017 and 90 on one in 2016.\nRead the full health inspection here.\nRELATED|How to check restaurant health inspections in metro Atlanta counties\n﻿In other news:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/ants-dirty-towels-get-popular-dekalb-jamaican-joint-failed-score/xRBYlqohAZUH6NkNNXc5MI/"}
