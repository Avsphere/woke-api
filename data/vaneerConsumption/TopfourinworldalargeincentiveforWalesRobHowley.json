We are aware of that.\n“We have the opportunity to go into the next World Cup ranked fourth in the world. That is a large incentive for players and the coaches.”\nRob Howley\nWales have won their last five encounters against France – their last loss to Les Bleus came in the 2011 World Cup semi-final – and Howley has predictably retained the team that accounted for Ireland.\nFrance, though, pushed England and Ireland close, while also beating Scotland and Italy, and Howley is aware of the threat they will pose.\n“I think that we will go in against a very good France side,” Howley added. “They were potentially – having watched the England and Ireland games – unlucky not to come away with more wins, and likewise with ourselves.\n“One game can be far different to the next, so we need to go out to Paris and perform to the level we have in training.\n“I was really pleased with the impact off the bench (against Ireland). In the course of the championship, it hasn’t been good enough, but against Ireland the bench came on and did their job.\nJamie Roberts\n“I keep mentioning about the 23 players – not about the 15 – and just consistently saying the same message to the players.\n“The bench made the difference, and ultimately in international games that is the difference between winning and losing, and thankfully last weekend we were on the right side of that.”\nSkipper Alun Wyn Jones will become the first Welshman to start 100 Tests for his country on Saturday, while Ken Owens wins his 50th cap.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4320976/Top-four-world-large-incentive-Wales--Rob-Howley.html"}
