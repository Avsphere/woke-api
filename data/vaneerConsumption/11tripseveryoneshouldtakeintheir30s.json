Dmitry Chulov / iStock Your 30s are a magical time. You're a fully formed adult, with all the responsibility that adulthood entails, but you might also have disposable income to spend. Thirty-year-olds \"are not looking to save money necessarily, they're looking to spend it quickly,\" says Andrea Malis, a travel advisor with Comeback Odyssey Travel in Tuscon, Arizona, of her millennial clients.
