The FBI stated that Mendoza ordered them to give up any money, but they had none.\nAccording to the Jorah Shane, Mendoza ordered them to walk away and leave their car behind. The daughter heard gunfire and turned to see Jason Shane Jr. on the ground. She then heard another gunshot and heard Tana scream, prompting the daughter to take off running despite the fact that she felt her face bleeding from a gunshot wound. Then another bullet struck her in the back.\nJorah escaped to a nearby school where she was able to get help. She was able to take family members back to the scene of the shooting, and then she was taken to a Billings hospital.\nMendoza was discovered later in the day by a Park County Sheriff’s Office deputy in Meeteetse, Wyoming. He told the FBI he “shot the victims because he was getting tired of waiting around, and because the daughter laughed at him.”\nMendoza is expected in federal court Friday.\nThe Shanes are survived by two sons and five daughters; their youngest just graduated high school.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/31/mother-and-father-shot-to-death-after-attempt-to-help-stranded-motorist/"}
