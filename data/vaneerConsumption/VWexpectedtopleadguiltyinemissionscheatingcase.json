The company could also be sentenced by Judge Sean Cox.\nLast month VW agreed to plead guilty and pay a $4.3 billion penalty for programming about 590,000 diesel vehicles to deceive U.S. regulators.\nThe company admitted installing software that activated pollution controls during government tests and switched them off in real-world driving. The cars spewed harmful nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times above the legal limit. Volkswagen also has admitted to lying to investigators to cover up the scheme.\nSeven VW employees also face criminal charges in the case.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4300268/VW-expected-plead-guilty-emissions-cheating-case.html"}
