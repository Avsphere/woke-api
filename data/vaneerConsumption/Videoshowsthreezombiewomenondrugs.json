When she was further away, both her and the woman she was with turned to look back again at the 'zombies'\nIt is not known if the women in the new video were on drugs, but their behavior appeared similar to 'K-2 zombies' who were seen in Brooklyn last year\nWHAT IS SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA? Synthetic marijuana contains man-made chemicals that act on the same cell receptors in the brain as THC does in natural marijuana. Researchers have found instances in which chemicals in synthetic marijuana can bind much more strongly to cell receptors than THC does in marijuana that is grown. This can produce stronger effects, such as an elevated mood or feeling of relaxation. But synthetic marijuana is also known to have psychotic effects on some users. These can include extreme anxiety, confusion, paranoia and even hallucinations.
