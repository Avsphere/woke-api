The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nA gun reform group on Wednesday called on discount retail chain Target to ban the open carrying of firearms in its stores.\nThe petition from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America follows demonstrations by a pro-gun group bringing long guns into Target stores.\nFollowing the petition, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder wrote in an email, \"The safety and security of our guests and team members is our highest priority. Target does not sell firearms or ammunition and is committed to following all state and federal laws. However, I don't have any specific information to share regarding this organization.\"\nShannon Watts, the gun reform group's founder, called the Target demonstrations \"unacceptable.\"\n\"Target is a central part of the lives of American mom — we expect to be safe and secure when we wheel our kids around in the store's red shopping carts. And we support the Second Amendment but people walking through the aisles flaunting their loaded weapons — as these extremist gun groups have been doing — is unacceptable,\" she said in a statement.\nHer group has had success in changing other corporate gun policies after launching similar campaigns against Chipotle, Sonic and Brinker International.\nIn response, Chipotle and Sonic asked customers to refrain from bringing firearms into its restaurants while Brinker asked Chili's Bar & Grill customers not to openly carry guns.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/gun-reform-group-aims-target-n122556"}
