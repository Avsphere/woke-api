(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\nCAPES\nLupita Nyong'o set the path here at the 2014 Golden Globes in a red caped Ralph Lauren dress. Gwyneth Paltrow did the same in white at the Oscars in a white Tom Ford back in 2012. The trend has been strong ever since, said Eric Wilson, fashion news director for InStyle magazine.\nOn Sunday, nobody did it quite like Jane Fonda.\n\"It was a cape-alapooza,\" Wilson laughed. \"I don't know what you want to call it, but it was incredible.\"\nSpecifically, Fonda wore Yves Saint Laurent Couture that had stiff sequined ruffles up top, flowing over the shoulders of the long-sleeve gown. The capelet, which opened to a high, loose neck, was balanced by a slim skirt that did her statuesque figure justice.\nOthers with cape details included Jennifer Lopez in chartreuse Giambattista Valli.\nSarah Tam, senior vice president of merchandising for RentTheRunway.com, loved all the cape effects, an especially flattering silhouette for the varied body types that her site.\n\"It was a trend for fall that we saw continuing for spring. Capes kind of cover the arms without being overbearing and that detailing gives movement to the backs,\" she said.\n___\nMETALLICS\nGold worthy of Studio 54 was abundant, as was a variety of reds and pinky blush tones.\nKate Bosworth presented in a Dolce & Gabbana rose payette strapless gown with a little silver sparkle thrown in. It was the orange reds that captured the heart of Connie Wang, fashion features director at the lifestyle site Refinery29.com. Jennifer Lawrence in a Dior Haute Couture red column gown with side cutouts was among her favorites.\n\"I feel like it's the color of the year. I don't care what Pantone says,\" Wang said. \"Amy Adams, Emmy Rossum, Angela Barrett. They all wore the orangier reds. It looks great with so many skin tones.\"\nIn the gold family: Regina King was fierce in a loose caped sparkler by Dolce & Gabbana. Fashion up-and-comer Brie Larson was in custom Calvin Klein Collection by Francisco Costa, complete with cutouts at the waist and a sexy rope-style halter. Rosie Huntington-Whitely wore a custom, fully beaded Champagne Atelier Versace gown with a delicate chiffon slip that fell from slightly above the knee.\n___\nUNUSUAL\nCate Blanchett won the night for pulling off a daring ombre pink mashup from Givenchy Haute Couture by Riccardo Tisci.\nWilson and Wang both loved it.\n\"What a fun dress. It was so unusual. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, too, was in a fun piece. It was the super lively dresses that really captured my attention,\" he said.\nWang added of Blanchett's look, with its fringe, embroidered panels and cape effect at the top: \"It was like cowgirl rodeo meets Great Gatsby meets My Little Pony. It was wild but she looked like a princess in it.\"\nThe dress was a baby pink tulle and the tiers of fringe were silk.\nGyllenhaal was in plunging gold and black from Marc Jacobs. The sleeveless look had a large flower applique on one shoulder. Her beauty inspiration from NARS, working with makeup artist Romy Soleimani, nicely summed up the vibe: \"Bombay Deco meets Michelle Pfeiffer in 'Scarface.'\"\n___\nSTARRY\nA few celebs went celestial.\nJenna Dewan Tatum was in a midnight blue ball gown with a plunging neckline and a pattern of embellishment evoking the night sky. It was Zuhair Murad Couture.\nViola Davis also looked starry in a Marchesa tulle ball gown with a plunging illusion neckline and fluttery full sleeves.\n\"It's just a delightful, fun statement,\" Wilson said. \"It kind of tugs at your sense of nostalgia and romance.\"\nOthers in blue included Kate Winslett, though she chose a more royal shade over midnight blue. It was custom Ralph Lauren Collection in a silk crepe criss-cross halter design and it hugged her perfectly.\n___\nYELLOWS\nLopez paired her yellow with 200 carats of Harry Winston diamonds, including a wreath necklace that accounted for 46.95 carats, set in platinum. It was bunchy with a high side slit and the aforementioned capelet detailing — and it's possible only JLo could have pulled it off.\nAmerica Ferrera lit up in a sleeveless Jenny Packham canary yellow look with jewels cascading down her open back. It had a large bow at the back of the halter style with the ends loose and long, her hair in a ballerina back-do.\n\"Jennifer Lopez was the best,\" Wilson said. \"You had the starry night and the shining yellow sunlight at the same time.\"\nJane Fonda arrives at the 73rd annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, Jan. 10, 2016, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif.
