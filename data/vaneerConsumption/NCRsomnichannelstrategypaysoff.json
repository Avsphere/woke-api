As a result, NCR will continue to expand its focus on software platforms and pushing them into new industries with room for growth.\nThat shows that the firm's early focus on omnichannel and software-focused offerings as the payments and retail industries become increasingly digitized is bearing fruit.\nIt's clear that the company's omnichannel strategy is filling a hole in the marketplace.\nNCR has been working to build a strong omnichannel presence. In its Q3 2016 earnings call, the firm noted that it sees itself as leader in three key areas in the shift to omnichannel: software, transformation, and digital enablement. By giving firms the platforms and services they desire, and then helping with the front- and back-end implementation to use them, it's clear that NCR had been planning for rapid growth in that segment, and so far, is seeing that focus pay off.\nThe firm's recent announcement indicates that strategy is paying off in the marketplace. NCR noted particular success with Retail ONE, its omnichannel offering that launched in June 2015. Retail ONE falls under the \"software\" category, and shows that the firm has a particular advantage in that area. That's unsurprising, as more and more merchants are offering additional channels and requiring omnichannel services that will support them.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ncrs-omnichannel-strategy-pays-off-2016-12"}
