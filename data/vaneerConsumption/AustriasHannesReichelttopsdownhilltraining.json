(Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/dpa via AP)\nWorld Cup skiing officials reacted to the injuries by using more colors and lines to mark the Kandahar course in Garmisch, but many racers said they hardly noticed the difference.\nReichelt said he skipped a gate but was still credited with the top time.\n\"I still have some pain in my knee, but I am glad to be here,\" Reichelt said. \"I've put the crash well behind me.\"\nTwo Norwegians finished behind Reichelt — Kjetil Jansrud and Aleksander Aamodt Klide. Jansrud was .60 seconds behind, and Kilde was .67 off the pace.\nAfter the crashes on the Streif, World Cup officials hope additional markings in purple and green will reduce the number of crashes and injuries.\nErik Guay, the Canadian who has won two World Cup races in the German resort and a world downhill title in 2011, said the Kandahar course was \"always dark and bumpy.\"\n\"I thought the purple was good, it showed up a lot, but it doesn't really affect me whatever they choose,\" said Guay, who had the 11th fastest time.\n\"I understand the course pretty well here. I haven't made the podium this year, so it's time to start pushing for those extra points. There are crucial areas on the course where you need to be fast, otherwise you have no chance of winning. You have to risk it. I feel comfortable and ready to charge.\"\nBeat Feuz of Switzerland, second in Kitzbuehel, said he could see no difference in the colors, but found it good that \"they are trying something to improve the safety of the course.\"\nJohan Clarey of France said he, too, didn't notice any difference and complained that one jump was too big.\nTravis Ganong of the United States agreed. \"The jump is huge,\" Ganong said, adding that skiers will probably ask for it to be reduced before Saturday's race.\n\"I didn't even notice the lines, the snow was pretty soft,\" Ganong added. \"It's not really winter. It's dead snow, no power, no response, the skis are a lot slower.\"\nGanong said making the tracks slower by adding more terrain made them more dangerous. \"It's totally fine if it's sunny, but it's never sunny. This season we've had overcast, snow ... they should try to make it safe in all conditions.\"\nAndrew Weibrecht, the top American in training in 10th place, said he never noticed the new markings.\n\"But it's good that they are trying to innovate a bit,\" he said. \"They've gone in so many different directions since I've been around. They are coming back to the true nature of downhill. It's just a dangerous sport and we all accept that risk.\"\nThe latest casualty was Olympic and world giant slalom champion Ted Ligety, who tore ligaments in his right knee in giant slalom training in Germany on Wednesday. The American is returning home.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to correct the spelling of Ganong throughout.\nKjetil Jansrud of Norway speeds down the course during the men's downhill training at the Alpine skiing World Cup in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016.
