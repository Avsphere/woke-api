When she removed her hair from the water, another employee helped wrap it with a towel.\n“I just got out my phone and I just started to record,” said Antonio Robinson, who was one of the customers who caught the now former employees in the act. “I just thought it was nasty and I needed to let somebody see this.”\nWaffle House told Fox13, “We were made aware of this via a Facebook Private message this morning. We immediately reached out to the local management team. After identifying the parties involved, they were immediately terminated. The health department has been out to the restaurant for an inspection which it passed and they have closed the case. We do not tolerate these behaviors and strive to provide a clean, safe environment for all our customers.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/14/two-waffle-house-employees-fired-for-using-restaurant-equipment-to-fix-hair/"}
