Glasgow - 77 per cent 2. Received Pronunciation - 74 per cent 3. Estuary - 70 per cent 4. Southern Irish - 70 per cent 5. Northern Irish - 70 per cent 6. Edinburgh - 66 per cent 7. Cockney - 61 per cent 8. Newcastle - 60 per cent 9. Liverpool - 57 per cent 10. Cornish - 57 per cent 11. Yorkshire - 56 per cent 12. Welsh - 55 per cent 13. Somerset - 53 per cent 14. Lancashire - 36 per cent 15. Birmingham - 31 per cent\nWith each question users are played an audio clip of someone speaking with an accent.\nThey are then presented with a map of the UK and four regions to pick from.\nThe four answers are purely geographical as they are not labelled with the name of the region.\nThe researchers, from Washington-based travel company Expedia, also created an interactive dialectical map for users to explore.\n'We originally decided to create the map because we were inspired by the fact there are 56 recognised accents across the UK and Ireland,' Expedia told MailOnline.\n'We wanted to put together something that not only explores a good range of these very different dialects, but also doubles up as a nice educational piece.'\nWhile the map and quiz were released last year, Expedia has released the results for the first time today.\nThe data was collected from 1,300,000 guesses from over 250,000 users.\nThe results reveal that the Glaswegian accent is the UK's most recognisable dialect, with 77 per cent of quiz contestants identifying it correctly.\nThis was closely followed by 'received pronunciation' - the stereotypical southern English accent - which 74 per cent of users classified correctly.\nSouthern and Northern Irish accents were deciphered with equal ease, with both seeing a 70 per cent correct guess rate at fifth and sixth in the chart respectively.\nAt the lower end of the table, the Birmingham or 'Brummie' accent was the most difficult dialect to guess.\nResearchers created a quiz to find which of the British Isles' accents are the trickiest to decipher using 15 of our most distinct dialects. This graphic shows the rankings of each accent and the percentage of quiz contestants who identified them correctly\nThe Glaswegian accent is the most recognisable in the UK with 77 per cent of people able to correctly identify it. Actor James McAvoy (left) speaks with a Glaswegian accent. The received pronunciation accent, spoken by Benedict Cumberbatch, came second with 74 per cent\nSOCIAL STIGMAS LINKED TO BRITISH ACCENTS ITV's Tonight programme polled 4,000 Britons about their preferred accents in 2013. The accents included Liverpool, Devon, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Cardiff, London (Cockney), Belfast, Received Pronunciation, Manchester and Birmingham. The Scouse accent fared the worst across all categories as ITV found it was considered unintelligent, unfriendly and untrustworthy. The Devon accent scored highly in all three of these categories, and came top of the poll for friendliness. Interestingly, women were more likely than men to find almost all the accents more friendly, in particular London Cockney. On the subject of intelligence, three in five people said that Received Pronunciation, also referred to as 'Queenâ€™s English', is the most intelligent accent - almost twice the score of second place Edinburgh. One in five Brits admitted to being discriminated against because of how they talk, with Londoners and Scots believing they were most discriminated against.\nOnly 31 per cent of quiz contestants correctly guessed the accent.\nThe Lancashire accent also caused users problems, with only 36 per cent able to identify it.\nLast year a Cambridge University study found that regional accents are on their way out in the UK and Ireland.\nSome of the UK's most famous accents, such as singer Adele's (left) London 'Cockney' accent or actor Sean Bean's Yorkshire accent, scored surprisingly low in the study. Cockney was 7th overall with 61 per cent of users correctly guessing it while Yorkshire was 11th with 56 per cent\nThis is a result of regions becoming more 'homogenised' with cheaper transport and the internet.\nBut the quiz's results could prove that regional dialects are still going strong.\n'The response regionally to the test has been wide-ranging,' Expedia told MailOnline.\n'But the discussion created around regional accents and the development, protection and proliferation of them has been fascinating to see.\n'Brits really care about their regional dialects, and the threat of losing them as accents become more homogenised in the UK is really something that they are passionate about.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4319792/Test-unveils-UK-s-toughest-dialects-decipher.html"}
