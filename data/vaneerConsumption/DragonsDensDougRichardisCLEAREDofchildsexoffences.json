It has been distressing.'\nDuring his trial, the 57-year-old told the court he chatted to hundreds of young women almost every day for more than four years about his sexual fantasies on a website called Seeking Arrangements, meeting more than 100 of them.\nRichard, who called himself a 'sugar daddy', met around two women, known as 'sugar babies', every month to see 'if they wanted to take it further'.\nScroll down for video\nOne of those was the 13-year-old, who the businessman spanked and had sex with, as her 15-year-old friend waited in the next room.\nBut the multi-millionaire told jurors he believed she was an experienced 17-year-old and insisted he would never 'knowingly' have sex with a child.\nThe court heard he gave the girl and her friend who accompanied her £60 each in cash, which Richard insisted was a 'gift' and not payment.\nThe court heard how he collected the teenagers at Liverpool Street station last January and after taking then for a coffee had suggested they go 'somewhere private'.\nHe then took them to a £149-a-night apartment in Bishopsgate where he asked them if they wanted to be his slaves.\nWhile the older girl rejected his advances, the younger girl agreed to be spanked by him and then had sex.\nRichard, a father of three who called himself a sugar daddy, met about two women, known as sugar babies, every month to see 'if they wanted to take it further' (photographed outside court today)\nRichard has three children, Talia, 24, Cecely, 22 and Lucas, 19, with his wife Caroline Gonzalez-Carvajal, 54, who is believed to be still living with him.\nDuring the trial he said: 'As mortifying as it is to say, I was looking for roleplay and fantasy relationships involving dominance and submission. It was a Fifty Shades of Grey type of stuff.\n'It was secret, it was infidelity. I was cheating on my wife. It bothered me but I was also quite addicted to this.'\nHe described the relationship with the young teenager as 'lots of sexy texting and me being dominant and a Christian Grey figure and her being submissive.'\nChristian Grey is the fictional wealthy entrepreneur from the Fifty Shades of Grey books.\nIn one conversation, the technology entrepreneur asked the 13-year-old: 'Are you free to come to London after school?'\nRichard claimed he thought the girl, who is 5ft and weighs less than six stone, was 17 - even after she sent him a naked picture - and said he was 'mortified' to learn she was 13.\nHe was arrested in the early hours of January 5 last year at the Lord Milner Hotel in Westminster where officers told him: 'You had sex with a child.'\nHe said: 'As you can see I'm in quite a lot of trouble,' before asking: 'What if I thought she was over 16 but she was in fact under 16?'\nWhen police advised him to talk to his lawyer, Richard said: 'Under 16, wow.'\nHe told jurors: 'I would never have sex with a child, I would never knowingly have sex with someone under age.'\n'I was shocked beyond belief.'\nThe technology entrepreneur (second from left, with his Dragons Den co-stars) quit the popular BBC show after famously failing to invest a penny in the second series\nRichard, who is originally from California but now lives in a £6m townhouse in Islington, North London, received an award from the Queen for services to enterprise in 2006.\nEarlier in the trial the entrepreneur, who appeared as an investor in the first two series of the BBC's Dragons' Den programme where he failed to invest a single penny, said his 'reputation has been shattered'.\nBefore his acquittal Mr Richard - who is worth £52million - was a regular speaker on the after-dinner circuit, but after the sordid revelations in court he is likely to discover his reputation is irrefutably tarnished.\nHe also told the trial his company School for Startups is near bankruptcy, and has had to lay off 99 per cent of staff since his arrest 12 months ago.\nThe businessman - whose sister is a federal judge in California - was obviously proud of his reputation in Britain, with lucrative contracts with the Government.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423023/Former-Dragon-s-Den-star-Doug-Richard-accused-having-50-Shades-Grey-sex-13-year-old-girl-CLEARED-Old-Bailey.html"}
