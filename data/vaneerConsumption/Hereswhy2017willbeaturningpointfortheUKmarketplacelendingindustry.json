There is a risk that, with time, the lenders that survive will become increasingly similar to incumbent banks, as the traditional banking model has been proven to be sustainable and profitable.\nZopa, for instance, has already applied for a full banking license. But for the marketplace lending industry to continue to benefit consumers, the remaining players will have to find ways to consistently offer services not provided by legacy banks, at a lower cost, while remaining compliant.\nWe've entered the most profound era of change for financial services companies since the 1970s brought us index mutual funds, discount brokers and ATMs.\nNo firm is immune from the coming disruption and every company must have a strategy to harness the powerful advantages of the new fintech revolution.\nThe battle already underway will create surprising winners and stunned losers among some of the most powerful names in the financial world: The most contentious conflicts (and partnerships) will be between startups that are completely reengineering decades-old practices, traditional power players who are furiously trying to adapt with their own innovations, and total disruption of established technology & processes:\nTraditional Retail Banks vs. Online-Only Banks: Traditional retail banks provide a valuable service, but online-only banks can offer many of the same services with higher rates and lower fees\nTraditional retail banks provide a valuable service, but online-only banks can offer many of the same services with higher rates and lower fees Traditional Lenders vs. Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces : P2P lending marketplaces are growing much faster than traditional lenders—only time will tell if the banks strategy of creating their own small loan networks will be successful\n: P2P lending marketplaces are growing much faster than traditional lenders—only time will tell if the banks strategy of creating their own small loan networks will be successful Traditional Asset Managers vs. Robo Advisors: Robo advisors like Betterment offer lower fees, lower minimums and solid returns to investors, but the much larger traditional asset managers are creating their own robo-products while providing the kind of handholding that high net worth clients are willing to pay handsomely for.\nAs you can see, this very fluid environment is creating winners and losers before your eyes…and it's also creating the potential for new cost savings or growth opportunities for both you and your company.\nAfter months of researching and reporting this important trend, Sarah Kocianski, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has put together an essential report on the fintech ecosystem that explains the new landscape, identifies the ripest areas for disruption, and highlights the some of the most exciting new companies.

And if you're employed in any part of the digital economy, you'll want to know how you can exploit these new technologies to make your employer more efficient, flexible and profitable.\nAmong the big picture insights you'll get from The Fintech Ecosystem Report: Measuring the effects of technology on the entire financial services industry:\nFintech investment continues to grow.

Insurtech, robo advisors, and digital-only banks are only a few of the segments making waves. B2B fintechs are also playing an increasingly prominent role in the ecosystem.\nIt's not all good news for fintechs. Major hurdles, including customer acquisition and profitability, remain. As a result, many are becoming more willing to enter partnerships and adjust their business models.\nIncumbents are enacting strategies to ensure they remain relevant. Many financial firms have woken up to the threat posed by fintechs and are implementing innovation strategies to stave off disruption. The majority of these strategies involve some interaction with fintech firms.\nThe relationship between incumbents and fintechs continues to evolve. Fintechs are no longer viewed exclusively as a threat, nor can they be ignored.
