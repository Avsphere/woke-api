A journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, she had been a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin as well as Russia's war in Chechnya.\nRustam Makhmudov was sentenced to life in prison on Monday after he was found guilty of pulling the trigger. His uncle, Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, was also given a life term after he was convicted of organizing the murder.\nIbragim Makhmudov was sentenced to 12 years in prison, his brother Dzhabrail Makhmudov to 14 years, and Sergei Khadzhikurbanov to 20 years. All the men were found guilty of murder for their parts in the killings.\nThe murder raised worldwide questions about freedom of speech and of the press under Putin â€” especially after three of the defendants were initially acquitted in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned those acquittals and ordered a new trial.\nNBC News' Alexander Smith contributed to this report from London.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/killers-russian-journalist-anna-politkovskaya-jailed-life-n126011"}
