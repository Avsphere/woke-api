Truth doesn’t matter to them, they only have their hatred & agenda,” he wrote. “This includes fake books, which come out about me all the time, always anonymous sources, and are pure fiction. Enemy of the People!”\nTrump signaled frustration with NBC News as well, sharing rumors that Andy Lack would be fired.\n“What’s going on at CNN is happening, to different degrees, at other networks – with NBC News being the worst,” he wrote. “The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence and much worse.”\nThe New York Post reported that Comcast executives are quietly seeking a replacement for Lack.\nTrump also lashed out at NBC anchor Lester Holt concerning an interview with him on his decision to fire James Comey in May 2017, accusing him of “fudging” the tape.\nCritics seized on a line in the interview where Trump included the Russia investigation as part of the criteria for firing Comey.\n“In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story; it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,’” Trump said to Holt:\nThe hatred and extreme bias of me by @CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function. But actually, as I have always said, this has been going on for a long time. Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, & AT&T should fire him to save credibility! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2018\nWhat’s going on at @CNN is happening, to different degrees, at other networks – with @NBCNews being the worst. The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence, and much worse. When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia, they were hurt badly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2018\nIvanka Trump & Jared Kushner had NOTHING to do with the so called “pushing out” of Don McGahn.The Fake News Media has it, purposely,so wrong! They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn’t exist-just a “smooth running machine” with changing parts! — Donald J.
