It is a dream for me. I am looking forward to meeting and getting to know my new team-mates and cannot wait to play.\n‘I thank Chelsea for their support and hope I can repay this faith to the club and its fans.’\nPato had been viewed as one of the most exciting young players in Europe when he joined Milan but his career stagnated in Italy after injury problems and he returned to Brazil in January 2013 having scored 63 goals in 150 appearances.\nHe has made 27 appearances for the Brazil national team, scoring 10 goals, but has not played at international level since the 2012 Olympic Games.\nPato arrived in London on Wednesday before putting the finishing touches on his 'dream' switch\nThe striker started brightly at AC Milan but was eventually shipped off to Corinthians after falling out of favour\nPato (left) reinvigorated his career at Sao Paulo and scored 38 goals in two seasons on loan\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink had earlier insisted signing Pato would not be a gamble.\nHe said: 'It's not a gamble, coming on loan makes it possible for a good view of him and whether he can adapt.
