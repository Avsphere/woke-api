Since the creation of its in-house bad bank, UBS's shares have risen nearly 40 percent.\nBarclays' investment bank will be left with 120 billion euros ($167 billion) of risk-weighted assets and, while significantly smaller than U.S. players such as JP Morgan , will still be the largest investment bank in Europe with more assets than the \"core\" businesses of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse after they also streamlined their operations.\n- Reuters","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/barclays-bank-axing-19-000-jobs-cutting-back-its-ambitions-n100246"}
