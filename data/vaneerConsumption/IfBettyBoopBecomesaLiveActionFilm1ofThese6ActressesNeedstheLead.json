Variety reports Cowell's production company, Syco Entertainment, is teaming up with Animal Logic Entertainment to produce the first full-length Betty Boop movie since 1939. Dave McNary writes that Cowell's production company and the animation team behind The Lego Movie are partnering with the owners of the original Betty Boop character, which first appeared in 1930 as a spunky, sexy 1920s flapper. The reboot is being called a \"hybrid animated comedy,\" which doesn't tell us much about what the movie will look like. The original Betty Boop character was known for her neck-high cleavage and cutesy sex-pot vibe, which doesn't seem appropriate for a kid's animated film. So that leaves an animated/half live-action comedy for adults? It's anyone's guess, at this point.\nKelly Faircloth of Jezebel calls Cowell's Betty Boop remake the movie \"nobody was clamoring for\", and she has a point: Though the character was, at one time, incredibly popular, she's been in retirement for so long that it seems like an unconventional, though not necessarily bad, decision to bring her back, especially for Cowell.\nVulture's Lindsey Weber writes that if the movie becomes live action or ends up involving non-animated people, she'd nominate Zooey Deschanel for the role of Betty. Deschanel's great and seems like she'd be a shoo-in should the role ever become available, but there are plenty of great, totally adorable actresses out there who could be the perfect Betty (if Deschanel's like, tired of cornering the market on cute quirkiness or doing other projects). For example:\nKristen Schaal\nJesse Grant/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nEven though she kind of gives off more of an Olive Oyl, Schaal could totally pull off a real-life Betty Boop. Also, I just love talking about how much I love Kristen Schaal.\nGinnifer Goodwin\nShe's just so cute and Boop-like.\nMae Whitman\nValerie Macon/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nMae Whitman is quirky, adorable, and also super Boopy.\nLucy Hale\nLucy Hale has the most perfect Betty Boop face out of anyone ever. The End.\nReese Witherspoon\nReese Witherspoon is probably my favorite (completely hypothetical) potential Betty Boop right now (again, in my own mind). Betty Boop NEEDS to be made into a live action film, if only for the purpose of bringing back Witherspoon's early 2000's cuteness.\nImages: Getty Images (2); Giphy (3)","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35838-if-betty-boop-becomes-a-live-action-film-1-of-these-6-actresses-needs-the-lead"}
