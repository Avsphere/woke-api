The foundation says the areas are central to Jewish heritage.\nIn 2014, then-White House spokesman Josh Earnest condemned the purchase of 25 apartment units in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem, a settler takeover that Elad helped oversee.\nJerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat lauded Beeri as \"a man of vision as he is a man of action.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4320920/Israel-highest-honor-settler-leader.html"}
