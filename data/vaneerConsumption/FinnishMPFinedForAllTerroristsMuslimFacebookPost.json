They hit him with a €1,160 (£991) fine, YLE Uutiset reports.\nMr. Hakkarainen accepted the verdict, however, and appears not be backing down.\nFollowing the December Berlin truck attack, claimed by Islamic State, Mr. Hakkarainen remarked on his Facebook page: “This is yet another indication of how much [Islam] appreciates and respect the Western way of life.”\nThe Finns Party rose from receiving 4 per cent of the vote in the 2007 parliamentary election to receiving almost 18 per cent in 2015.\nThey currently hold 37 of the 200 parliamentary seats in Finland and have been part of the country’s governing three-party coalition since 2015.\nSince stepping into government, the party has reportedly toned down many of its positions.\nFinland, however, has responded to public demand by tightening its immigration policies, along with other Nordic countries, after about 32,000 migrants arrived in the country in 2015 – up tenfold on 2014.\nUnwarranted asylum applications are now fast-tracked and applicants returned quickly. This includes those arriving across the border from Russia, which Finnish officials have declared a safe country.\nAge tests are also conducted on asylum-seekers suspected of not being minors, and those using false documents are liable for punishment.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/01/05/finnish-mp-fined-terrorists-muslim-facebook-post/"}
