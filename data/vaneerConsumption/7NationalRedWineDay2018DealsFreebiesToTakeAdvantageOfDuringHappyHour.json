Mark your calendars and polish your red wine glasses, National Red Wine Day is on Tues., Aug. 28. To celebrate, there are National Red Wine Day 2018 deals and freebies to commemorate the occasion.\nIf your favorite kind of deal is cozying up to a pour of Gamay in wool socks — even in the summer — after a strenuous day at your 9-5, imagine all of that 10 percent off.
