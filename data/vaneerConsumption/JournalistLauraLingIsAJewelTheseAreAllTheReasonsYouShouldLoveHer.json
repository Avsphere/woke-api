Network isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think hard-hitting journalism or documentary series, but Society X with Laura Ling is just that. Usually home to shows like Bridalplasty and Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the entertainment channel's programming blocks haven't been known for non-celebrity news.

This week's episode covers the world of \"living dolls,\" or people who get multiple invasive surgeries and subject themselves to cosmetic rituals to achieve a particularly doll-like appearance.\nWhile the subjects might be a little odd, and dare I say occasionally creepy, the woman in front of the camera with them is not. Ling will be hitting television screens nationwide, and if she seems a little bit familiar, you're not wrong.
