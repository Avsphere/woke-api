If you had asked somebody even just a year ago, will all of these accusations against Bill Cosby go anywhere? You’d say no.”\nLouis continued, “there are accusations that go back, decades about what bill clinton did. some of them are quite lurid, some of them seem spectacular, some of them seem hard to believe, accusations of sexual assault and so forth. The people are still out there though. The people have never given up those claims in some ways. If Donald Trump is saying, ‘I’m going to put my very large megaphone behind — or in front of some of those women, and let them say what they have to say, including Hillary Clinton’s role,’ it will be at a minimum a distraction, but it could very likely change the course of that discussion.”\n(h/t NewsBusters)\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/01/04/errol-louis-there-is-bill-cosby-thing-with-clinton-sex-allegations-trump-could-very-likely-change-discussions-course/"}
