He has been a long-time friend and trusted advisor to me. His strong relationships in Israel will form the foundation of his diplomatic mission and be a tremendous asset to our country as we strengthen the ties with our allies and strive for peace in the Middle East. Nothing is more critical than protecting the security of our citizens at home and abroad.”\n“I am deeply honored and humbled by the confidence placed in me by President-elect Trump to represent the United States as its Ambassador to Israel,” Friedman said in response to the announcement. “I intend to work tirelessly to strengthen the unbreakable bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region, and look forward to doing this from the U.S. embassy in Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem.”\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Friedman served as Trump’s main advisor on issues related to Israel.\nA press release put out by Trump’s transition team stated that under Friedman’s leadership “the US-Israel relationship will be a model of cooperation and respect.”\nThe transition statement further said that the incoming Trump administration anticipates “extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation” between the U.S. and Israel.\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
