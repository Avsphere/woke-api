Jordan - a situation he stopped the music to rectify.\n'You did it all, I just hung on for dear life,' he told Coogler - but his words were not aired as the show had gone to commercial break.\nThe apparent omission of Cooger and Jordan didn't go unnoticed by fans, who tweeted their outrage.\nSelma director Ava DuVernay responded by writing: 'Well. I'm gonna go ahead and thank RYAN COOGLER + MICHAEL B. JORDAN since no one else is. Thank you, brothers.

Damon was clearly in a nostalgic mood as the actor noted that he was onstage at the Globes 18 years before for his film Good Will Hunting, where he won for Best Screenplay along with Ben Affleck.\nWinner! Matt Damon was named Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical Film for The Martian\nOut of this world: Damon plays an astronaut stranded on Mars in the celebrated sci fi film\nEnding on a high note: Jon Hamm took Best Actor In A TV Drama at the Golden Globes for the second time for his work on Mad Men, which has seen him nominated at the ceremony six times over the years\nThe father-of-four said: 'My kids are watching so I have to thank my kids, because I told them if I got on TV, I'd definitely say something to them.\n'So get ready to go to bed.'\nHe then turned his attention to his spouse of more than 15 years, former barmaid Luciana Barroso, who he met while filming Stuck On You in Miami.\nThe emotional actor said: '(To) my wife, thank you Lucy for everything.'\nHowever, earlier that night, host Ricky Gervais quipped as he introduced Damon: 'It's the star of the hilarious comedy The Martian. He is also the only person that Ben Affleck hasn't been unfaithful to.'\nMatt, obviously caught off-guard by the comment, certainly seemed to have a sense of humour about the joke as he couldn't help but smile and hold back laughter as he introduced his film a nominee for Best Picture Comedy.\nKate Winslet was the first winner at the 73rd annual Golden Globes on Sunday night at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles in front of Hollywood's biggest stars\nKate beat out some stiff competition in her stacked category, including, Jane Fonda (Youth), Jennifer Jason Leigh (The Hateful Eight), Helen Mirren (Trumbo), Alicia Vinkander (Ex-Machina)\nShaken: Kate looked clearly shocked to have won in her category\nTime to celebrate!

Sorry,’ Kate said after embracing Channing and Jonah (who was hilariously and confusingly dressed as the bear from The Revenant) onstage. ‘I really am actually extremely surprised and overwhelmed.’\nThat's awkward!

But don’t be mad because don’t forget I’m a bear. I don’t f***ing care.'\nKicking off the night, Gervais, who hosted the evening for the fourth time, took to mocking and satirizing the night's winners before a single nomination was announced.\nSipping a beer onstage, he said: 'If you do win tonight you should know that no one cares about that award as much as you do. Don’t get emotional it is embarrassing. That award is worthless. It is a bit of metal that some nice old journalists wanted to give you to meet you and get a selfie.'\nGervais greeted the crowd (which he labeled 'pill-popping sexual deviant scum') with a predictably astringent opening, setting the tone for an expletive-filled night that was at turns irreverent and frivolous.\nA bit of humor: Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling took the stage to introduce their film The Big Short for Best Picture but ended overshadowing their presentation with some fun banter\nWhat's that in your eye? Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell teamed up once again to present an award\nJim Carrey made his first public appearance since the death of his on/off girlfriend Cathriona White four months ago\nWinning!

She's become a role model for trans people everywhere, showing great bravery and destroying stereotypes. She didn't do a lot for women drivers. You can't have everything, can you, not at the same time.'\nIn February 2015 Bruce Jenner - as Caitlyn was then known - was involved in a fatal car crash on the PCH which resulted in the death of a fellow driver.\nIn an election year, Gervais had the only cutting political remark in the show. He introduced presenters Eva Longoria and America Ferrera as two talented actresses that 'your next president, Donald Trump, can't wait to deport.'\nQuentin Tarantino accepted the award for Best Composer on behalf of Ennio Morricone. Taking to the stage, he compared the composer to Mozart and Schubert.\nDenzel Washington was given the Golden Globe lifetime achievement award, with his Philadelphia co-star Tom Hanks saluting him as an actor with the 'mysterious power not just to hold our attention, but demand it.'\nWhat would my nickname be?

This young lady is absolutely the love of my life'\nHanks recited a list of legendary actors - Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and the like - that command the most respect in the industry.\n'The list is finite,' Hanks said. 'The club is exclusive. But it includes the actor who is being given the Cecil B. DeMille Award tonight.'\nWashington brought his family onstage for a speech that appeared to be cut short by a failure to bring his glasses with him. His wife reminded him twice that he needed them - and the second time, he agreed.\nWashington won Oscars for roles in Glory and Training Day, and has a long list of credits including Malcolm X, The Hurricane, Flight, The Manchurian Candidate and Mo' Better Blues.\nIn his speech, he thanked his mother for convincing his father that the family needed light bulbs more powerful than 25 watts.\n'God bless you all,' he concluded.\nLooking sharp: Foxx posed with lifetime achievement honoree Denzel and Will Smith at the event\nThe Fresh Prince: Will was joined by his wife of nearly 20 years Jade Pinkett\nHe's back!

I'm two-time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey going to get some well-needed shut-eye.'\n'When I dream I don't just dream any old dream. I dream about being three-time Golden Globe actor Jim Carrey. Because then I would be enough,' he said, pausing dramatically.

But for us, this is huge.'\nAnd during another humorous bit in the broadcast, Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling took the stage. Ryan appeared uncomfortable onstage when Brad asked him what was wrong.\nThe younger star jokingly admitted: 'To be honest, I was told I was presenting alone.\n'I’ve been cast in some kind of Joe Biden, Andy Richter, Robin kind of role.'\nMeanwhile, with more than 7,500 glasses of free Moët Champagne poured, perhaps the 2016 edition of the Golden Globes was always going to be an expletive-ridden affair.\nThe force is strong with him!

'It has to come naturally. What do people usually call you?'\n'Usually they just call me c**t', Schumer replied, as the censors jumped in to bleep her out.\nWhile Jamie Foxx decided to take a jab at Steve Harvey and his now infamous Miss Universe blunder. The 48-year-old jokingly named Straight Outta Compton as the winner for the category, Best Original Score for a motion picture, while presenting at the awards show.\nIn December, Steve mistakenly named Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutierrez, as Miss Universe instead of the winner, Miss Philippines' Pia Wurtzbach.\nJamie's co-presenter, actress Lily James, burst into laughter as he apologized.
