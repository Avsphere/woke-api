The online giant currently accounts for about 41 percent of new book sales, according to a March report from Codex Group, which gives it considerable clout.\nFor whatever reason (both parties have not revealed the details of the negotiations), Amazon and Hachette are stuck in a stalemate. Amazon has decided to buy less Hachette inventory, the company said in a statement. The result? Some Hachette books were suddenly not in stock, others were not available for pre-order, and shipping was delayed.\n\"If you do need one of the affected titles quickly, we regret the inconvenience and encourage you to purchase a new or used version from one of our third-party sellers or from one of our competitors,\" the company wrote.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/stephen-colbert-amazon-means-war-n123591"}
