A trial is expected later this year.\n\"This is in no way an official Norwegian recognition of the digital currency,\" Beck Pedersen told The Associated Press.\nDuring the two-year investigation, which he described as \"challenging,\" Norwegian police worked with investigators abroad and the case was linked to the drug-selling website Silk Road that was shut down in 2013 when its founder was arrested in the United States.\nThe men formed an organized group, he said, adding they were arrested in June 2015 in greater Oslo. Investigators seized \"considerable amounts of narcotics,\" several computers and an illegal indoor marijuana farm. No details were available.\nThe narcotics were sent by mail to customers.\nBitcoin allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4300756/Norwegian-prosecutors-demand-bitcoins-drug-sales.html"}
