I just want the difficult surgery to go well.\n'The future is a big surgery, long period of recovery.\nMourinho also confirmed that midfielder Paul Pogba won't be available for the derby game\n'But the future is also in the hands of a very strong guy, mentally very strong who wrote immediately in his social media he will stop when he wants, not when people think, so it looks to me that he is not going to give up, he is going to fight and I am really pleased with that. That is the Zlatan I know.\n'I told him, 'You've fought all your life', so I don't see a reason not to fight.\n'We think he is in fabulous hands and he has to recover from the injury and prepare himself mentally for the next step.\n'I think the next step will be something he really wants, which is what I said before the injury in the period of doubt about his future.\nIbrahimovic will miss the rest of the season and maybe more after his injury against Anderlecht\nThe striker has undergone surgery in America after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament\nSeason at a glance Live tables\nFixtures\nScores Premier League\nPremier League\nChampionship\nLeague One\nLeague Two\nScottish Premiership\nScottish Div 1\nScottish Div 2\nScottish Div 3\nLigue 1\nSerie A\nLa Liga\nBundesliga\n'I always thought he is much more important than myself or what I want, it is what he wants.\n'I always want players to be happy to choose their future and I think this is what is to happen.'\nPogba sustained a muscle injury in the win at Burnley at the weekend and will not be available at the Etihad Stadium, along with defenders Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, whom Mourinho on Sunday implored to 'be brave' with their injuries.\nAsked whether Pogba would be fit, the Portuguese replied: 'Paul? No.'\nA win on Thursday would lift United above Manchester City and into the top four, but Mourinho said stealing a march on their neighbours would only be relevant if it meant they secured Champions League football - which they can still achieve by winning the Europa League.\nPogba will also miss the match against United's rivals after his injury against Burnley\n'It means nothing. If we finish fifth and they finish sixth and we are above them it means nothing,' he added.\n'If they finish third and we finish fourth they are above us, but it means a lot.\n'This is not about Pep (Guardiola), this is not about City, it is about fighting for objectives.\n'We want to play Champions League football and we still have two doors open.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4448328/Jose-Mourinho-won-t-speak-Ibrahimovic-comeback.html"}
