Seraing previously joined Malta-based investment fund Doyen to challenge FIFA in a Belgian court.\nDoyen reportedly paid 300,000 euros ($318,000) into Seraing's 2015 budget to buy 30 percent of some players' transfer rights.\nFIFA says CAS cut the club's sanction to three transfer windows from four.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4300990/FIFA-ban-investors-owning-transfer-rights-upheld-court.html"}
