Mike Tyson owned three Bengal tigers, costing him Â£57,000 each and famously made a cameo with a tiger in The Hangover.\nMayweather has displayed cat-like reflexes in defence throughout his decorated career and may need to call on them once more.\nThe 40-year-old has said he will come out of retirement for a mega-fight against UFC star Conor McGregor.\nMayweather is not the first boxer to take an interest in big cats and Mike Tyson is also a fan\nThere was also a rare white tiger brought in for the entertainment of the 'Money man'\nA possible fight between the pair appears to be edging ever closer with UFC president Dana White insisting he will not stand in the way of negotiations.\nThis is a remarkable softening of approach from White who previously stated he was more likely to start the Superbowl as back-up quarterback than see the fight taking place.\nIf the highly anticipated contest does go ahead, Mayweather will be the one let off the leash for the 50th time and will have to become the predator once more.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-4319380/Floyd-Mayweather-struggles-control-tiger.html"}
