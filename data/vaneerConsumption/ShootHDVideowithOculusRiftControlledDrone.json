Like its predecessor, it can be controlled with the optional Skycontroller or an iOS or Android app. The Bebop can also be flown with the Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset developed by Oculus VR, purchased by Facebook in March for $2 billion.\nParrot has not released any pricing details yet. If itâ€™s even in the same ballpark as the AR.Drone 2.0, however, it could put aerial HD video within reach of regular consumers. (One of its main HD rivals, the Phantom 2 Vision from DJI, costs $999).\nThe whole thing weighs less than a pound and can fly as far as 1.2 miles away from the person operating it. (Sadly, it's battery can only support 12 minutes of flight time).\nThe Bebop also features GPS, which allows it to hover if someone drops the controller. Paired with its lighter, softer construction and blades that stop spinning once they hit something, the Bebop should provide some piece of mind for hobbyists worried about injuries and lawsuits.\nWhile no release date has been made public yet, Parrot says Bebop will be on sale in time for the holiday shopping season.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/gift-guide/shoot-hd-video-oculus-rift-controlled-drone-n103051"}
