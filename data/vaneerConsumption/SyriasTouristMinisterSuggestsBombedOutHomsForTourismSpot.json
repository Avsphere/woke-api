The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe besieged city of Homs has been one of the bloodiest battlegrounds of Syria's civil war -- but that didn't stop the country's tourism minister saying he anticipated a \"prosperous tourism season\" for the region.\nMinister Bisher Yazigi said the main tourist attractions would include the Wadi al-Nadara region and its imperious crusader castle, the Krak des Chevaliers. These would be boosted by \"miscellaneous activities ... planned in the two sites during summertime,\" state-run SANA news agency quoted him as saying over the weekend.\nMeanwhile, Homs Governor Talal al-Barazi added the Wadi al-Nadara region to the south of war-ravaged Homs was a \"tourist area par excellence\" and that there was a \"tourism week\" planned for the summer.\nSyrian officials' comments are at odds with daily reports of grinding bloody battles between government and rebels forces, and pictures of cities such as Homs reduced to little more than a bombed-out shells.\nJust last month more than 100 people, mostly civilians, were killed by a car bomb claimed by jihadi groups in Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syrias-tourist-minister-suggests-bombed-out-homs-tourism-spot-n98116"}
