Tears welled in the eyes of Jenner’s younger daughter, Kylie, whose sister, Kendall, wiped a tear from her eye.\n“I never wanted to hurt anyone else, most of all my family and my kids,” said Jenner, wiping her eye.\nShe admitted that until earlier this year she had never met another transgender person.\nThe 65-year-old told the audience about trans teenagers who are bullied, beaten up, murdered or kill themselves. Jenner mentioned two people by name whose deaths particularly touched her.\n“Trans people deserve something vital, they deserve your respect,” she said. “From that respect comes a more compassionate community.”\nJenner urged the crowd that included football, basketball, baseball and hockey superstars to remember what they say and do is “absorbed and observed by millions of people, especially young people.”\n“My plea for you tonight is one join me in making this one of your issues as well,” she said.\nMany in the crowd watched intently as Jenner spoke with little reaction on their faces.\n“If you want to call me names, make jokes and doubt my intentions, go ahead because the reality is I can take it,” she said. “But for thousands of kids out there coming to terms with the reality of who they are they shouldn’t have to take it.”\nA video narrated by “Mad Men” actor Jon Hamm traced Jenner’s life from the time when she was known as Bruce Jenner to her current transition. She mentioned she once considered ending her own life with a gun she owned.\nShe was shown applying makeup, buttoning her blouse in her closet and fastening the strap on her heeled shoes.\nWith her trembling hands clasped in front of her, Jenner joked with the audience about her struggle to select the cream gown she wore.\n“OK girls, I get it,” she said, as the audience laughed. “You to get the shoes, the hair, the makeup, it was exhausting. And the fashion police, please be kind on me. I’m new at this.”\nJenner didn’t walk the red carpet outside the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles, and she didn’t appear backstage to talk with reporters, as most of the previous Ashe award recipients have done. ESPN said Jenner wanted her onstage comments to stand.\nReaction among Jenner’s sporting peers on the red carpet was mixed.\nLittle League baseball pitcher Mo’ne Davis called Jenner brave.\n“She’s really brave to have the courage to get through a lot of those things,” said the 14-year-old who won best breakthrough athlete. “I know a lot of people give her a hard time about it but just for her family to give her that support is amazing.”\nFormer heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield said, “I just know that’s Bruce Jenner and I’ll leave it at that.”\nRadarOnline.com reported Wednesday that Jenner’s representatives approached ESPN suggesting the network give her the Ashe award in exchange for plugs on her upcoming E! docuseries. ESPN and ABC are owned by Disney.\n“That rumor is completely false,” ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz said. “The Arthur Ashe Courage Award and ABC interview were never connected.”\nJenner’s publicist Alan Nierob called the report “utterly false” and had no further comment.\nJenner’s selection to receive the Ashe award named for the late tennis player who died in 1993 after contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion generated strong debate online.\n“I met Arthur Ashe a few times. I know how important education was to him,” Jenner said. “Learn as much as you can about another person to understand them as well as you can.”\nOnline critics said college basketball player Lauren Hill, who died of brain cancer in April, was deserving of the Ashe honor.\nBut Hill’s mother, Lisa, attended the show and said her daughter would not have welcomed the controversy and made no judgment of others.\nJenner’s series called “I Am Cait” debuts July 26.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/07/15/espn-denies-accusations-of-granting-arthur-ashe-award-for-plugs-on-bruce-jenners-tv-show/"}
