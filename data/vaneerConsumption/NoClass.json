Never mind, as James Comey might say. Within minutes she was calling Donald Trump to concede, freeing him to appear before his supporters at the Hilton and those in the nation still wide awake.\nAs we await Hillary to finally speak to the nation herself, and wait and wait and wait, we’re struck by two things. She didn’t have the grace to appear before her own faithful workers and followers at the Javits Center, which might as well be renamed the Titanic. Simply blew them off. And so, one last time, we learned when three in the morning comes around, she won’t be there.\nHistory is just.","url":"https://spectator.org/no-class/"}
