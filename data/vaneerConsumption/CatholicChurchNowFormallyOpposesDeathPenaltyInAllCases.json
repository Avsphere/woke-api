In a letter to bishops about the revision, Cardinal Luis Ladaria, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, noted that Francis' predecessors spoke critically about the death penalty.\nLadaria said the change \"centers principally on the clearer awareness of the Church for the respect due to every human life.\"\nFor example, in 1995, Pope John Paul II said, \"There is evidence of a growing public opposition to the death penalty, even when such a penalty is seen as a kind of 'legitimate defence' on the part of society.\" He described that as a sign of hope.\nAnd, as Ladaria notes, Pope Benedict XVI called for \"the attention of society's leaders to the need to make every effort to eliminate the death penalty.\"\nThe change also reflects Francis' focus on prisons â€” as The Associated Press notes, he has \"long made prison ministry a mainstay of his vocation.\" He regularly visits inmates.\nLast year, there were \"993 executions in 23 countries,\" according to Amnesty International. That's down 4 percent from the previous year.\nReporting from Rome, NPR's Sylvia Poggioli says the catechism change is \"likely to be opposed by Catholics in the U.S. and other states where capital punishment is legal.\"\nThe pope also recently stressed the idea of individual dignity in a tweet that appeared critical of the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their families, as NPR's Amy Held reported.\n\"A person's dignity does not depend on them being a citizen, a migrant, or a refugee,\" he wrote last month. \"Saving the life of someone fleeing war and poverty is an act of humanity.\"","url":"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/02/634864608/catholic-church-now-formally-opposes-death-penalty-in-all-cases"}
