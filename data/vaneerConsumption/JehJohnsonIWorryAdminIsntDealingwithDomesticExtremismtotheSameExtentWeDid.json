We began funding these local organizations to counter violent extremism late in the Obama presidency, and we wanted to fund groups that would address domestic extremism, groups like Life After Hate, for example, for those who are leaving extremist domestic groups. And my fear is that the current administration is not dealing with it in the same way, to the same extent.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/10/29/jeh-johnson-i-worry-admin-isnt-dealing-with-domestic-extremism-to-the-same-extent-we-did/"}
