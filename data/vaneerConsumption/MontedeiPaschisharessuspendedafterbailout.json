This comes after the Tuscan lender failed to seal a private sector rescue deal at the 11th hour.\nAs a result of the bailout announcement trading in all stocks and derivatives in MPS has been halted temporarily, while 10 of the banks bonds have also been stopped on Friday morning, a statement from the Italian Stock Exchange said.\nOn Thursday, as investors waited for confirmation of Monte dei Paschi's bailout, the bank's stock plumbed fresh lows, dropping as much as 9% in trade.\nWhile Monte dei Paschi has seen its shares suspended, other lenders in the country have resumed this morning, and look to see the bailout news pretty favourably.\nThe FTSE Italia banking index, which looks at all listed lenders in Italy, is up by roughly 1.3% at 8.50 a.m. GMT (3.50 a.m. ET).
