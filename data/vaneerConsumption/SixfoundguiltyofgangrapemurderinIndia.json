Evidence showed she had been repeatedly raped.\nThe attack triggered anger in West Bengal state and came just months after the fatal gang rape of a student in Delhi in December 2012 that shone a global spotlight on violence against women in India.\nThe 2012 incident led to an overhaul of India's rape laws including speeding up of trials and tougher penalties for offenders, but high numbers of assaults persist.\nAbout 200 protesters gathered outside the court for Thursday's verdict demanding justice, an AFP reporter said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420809/Six-guilty-gang-rape-murder-India.html"}
