As a result of this relationship, Sarkeesian waived the majority of her standard $20,000 speaking fee, allowing the Associated Students (AS) to schedule her appearance for $5,000 instead,” wrote Adam R. Thomas in an article which has since been scrubbed of the $20,000 figure.\nIt is unknown as to why Thomas, who acts as the news editor for the Corsair Online, decided to later omit this fact, but after the figure was shared across social media, financially secretive Sarkeesian could not have been too impressed.\nIt looks like The Ministry of Truth got to the article revealing Anita Sarkeesian's speaking fees. #GamerGate pic.twitter.com/cX1GgOeGuM — Captain Privilege (@Capt_Privilege) February 24, 2016\nThe news comes after Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King tried to charge an undercover reporter $7,500 for a speech, not including travel and accommodation in November. The same agency quoted $50,000 for Atlantic journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates, but would not give a fee quote for Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, who was also represented by the agency.\nBreitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos is currently undergoing his “Dangerous Faggot “public speaking tour in the US, UK, and Mexico, where he is attending a number of student events and university campuses for free.\nCharlie Nash is a contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.
