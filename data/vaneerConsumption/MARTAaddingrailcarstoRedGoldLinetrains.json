Trains running on both lines will be extended from four to six cars until further notice, according to today’s news release.\nThis change comes after several other adjustments to create more frequent service and shorter wait times.\n“When we added more frequent trains, we realized we’d have the opportunity to fine-tune the service, and that’s what we’re doing now,” MARTA CEO Keith Parker said in the release. “We’ve been getting a lot of positive feedback about shorter wait times, and we’ll keep looking for other ways to make our bus and rail service more attractive by listening to customers about how we can keep making MARTA better.”\nA detailed list of service improvements can be found here.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/transportation/marta-adding-rail-cars-red-gold-line-trains/tGYssZLxpKqCq9deD2rUSO/"}
