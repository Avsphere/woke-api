In many cases that will develop into a sexual one because they’ll already think that the appearance of the robot matches their preference anyway, so if it looks nice and it has a superb personality too it’s inevitable that people will form very strong emotional bonds with their robots and in many cases that will lead to sex.”\nHuman interest in love and sex with robots and artificial intelligence has been on the rise recently, with The Love and Sex with Robots Conference due to take place at London’s Goldsmiths University in December. A sex robot cafe has also been announced for London, which will sell drinks, “sex, pastries – and nothing more.”\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
