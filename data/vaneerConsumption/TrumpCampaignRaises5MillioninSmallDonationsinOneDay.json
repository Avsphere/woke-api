Hillary Clinton raised $63 million, with only 36 percent of her campaign’s donations totaling less than $200.\nThe billionaire businessman is running a nimble campaign with only about 80 staffers, while Clinton is navigating the field with a staff nearly ten times larger. Trump has self-funded his campaign with $50 million.\nSo far, the Clinton campaign has spent $77 million on television ads, while the Trump campaign has spent only $5 million, beginning in August — and Clinton has lost her media-manufactured, post-convention bounce heading into the last two months before Election Day.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/09/01/trump-campaign-sets-fundraising-record-more-than-5-million-in-small-donations-in-one-day/"}
