They kept me overnight to keep an eye on everything. ‘Thankfully I got rid of the pain and everything, and recovered, but it was just too late (to make the semi-final).\nI'd not trained one minute, I'd not eaten anything and I'd lost a bit of weight. ‘It was obviously not ideal me going into the game. I was disappointed with that, but I'm happy I'm over that now and am back out on the pitch.\nCahill (right) celebrates with Cesc Fabregas as his team took a big step towards the title\n‘It's something I've had since I was small. I have been aware of it and it is just a matter of keeping an eye on it. The worst thing at the time was if they had to take it out or whatever and that would have obviously set me back for the season.\n‘I was happy that wasn't the case. It's just a matter of keeping an eye on it and monitoring it.\n‘There have been times when I knew it was going to come on and I'd take some strong painkillers for it. If you get it in midweek, it tends to be okay.\n‘But a night before a game is not ideal because you can be up all night and that's not great. But it was this on top of the viral infection, so when I was in there they tested my blood and wanted to keep me in.’","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4448292/Gary-Cahill-battled-gallbladder-problem-entire-career.html"}
