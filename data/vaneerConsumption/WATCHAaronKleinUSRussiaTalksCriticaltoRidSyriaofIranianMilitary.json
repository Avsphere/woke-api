It is also American and Western interests not to have Iran militarily embedded in Syria. And we have to say at the end of the day that it is a very good thing that America and Russia are not only a coordinating on this issue, but we are already seeing results.”\n“We have seen Israel strike — in fact, devastate — Iran’s military sites where they are heavily influenced in Syria in the last few months,” he stated. “There is no way that didn’t happen without Russian support.”\nContinued Klein: “We are talking here about eight years under Barack Obama where Russia was essentially allowed to embed themselves in Syria. And Russia allowed Iran to do what they have done over the last eight years. And so, it is a problem that has accumulated.”\n“And now we have not just leadership, not just words, not just rhetoric, but action,” Klein added. “We are seeing it now. We have seen it in the last few weeks and months, and I think we will continue to see it with Israel being allowed to target Iran in Syria.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2018/07/18/watch-aaron-klein-u-s-russia-talks-critical-to-rid-syria-of-iranian-military/"}
