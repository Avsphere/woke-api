Both officials were visiting the segment of the southwest border that lies in California.\nCNN’s Kate Bolduan seemingly defended the Obama Administration’s record on border security, noting that immigration activists labeled the former president the “Deporter-in-Chief.”\nAlthough the U.S. government removed a record number of immigrants under Obama Administration, some analysts argue that the deportations figures included many who were apprehended at or within 100 miles of the border and subsequently turned back as well as some Legal Permanent Residents (LPR) who committed removable offenses, including veterans.\nThe number of apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border has dramatically decreased since President Trump was elected.\nEarly this month, a new report from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) component of DHS revealed that border apprehensions had plummeted by more than 60 percent since Trump took office.\nBreitbart Texas reported:\nBorder apprehensions steadily increased in the nine months leading up to the presidential election in November, reaching a peak of 66,710 in October 2016. Since President Trump’s election on November 8, each month shows a decline in apprehension. The two full months following the inauguration show a dramatic drop to levels not seen in the past five years. Apprehensions decreased by more than 75 percent.\nThe 16,600 apprehensions last month represent the lowest number of border arrests in the past five years and a 30 percent decrease from the 23,750 illegals that Border Patrol agents arrested in February.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/border/2017/04/21/dhs-chief-obama-nothing-truly-secure-border/"}
