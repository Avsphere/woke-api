He was a promising player, very young and then went on. He’s a good player, a good guy and he can be very important for us.\n'He can help us get results and will score many goals I hope.’\nThe recruitment of a striker was made top priority by the club’s hierarchy after the surprise arrival of Guidolin 11 days ago.\nManager Francesco Guidolin told the press today the move will be complete once the player passes a medical\nThe Swans are desperate for fire power to boost their survival chances\nThe club retain an interest in Crystal Palace’s Dwight Gayle but it is understood they are currently unlikely to press ahead with a move if they keep Bafetimbi Gomis beyond this transfer window.\nSwansea are willing to sell if the right offer comes in for the striker, but are waiting on interest from the Middle East to develop to a firm bid.\nGuidolin said: ‘He is our player. There are a few days left of the window but I think he is an important player for us.’\nHe added: ‘At the moment there are a lot of rumours. But I do hope to have another midfielder. Paloschi is coming after the medical.’\nGuidolin was joined in Swansea yesterday by long-time No 2 Diego Bortoluzzi.\nThe manager also played down the likelihood of forwards Andre Ayew (R) and Bafetimbi Gomis (L) leaving\nGuidolin insisted the Frenchman still had a role to play at Swansea despite his lack of first team football\nBoss insisted that Ayew will remain at the club despite speculation linking him move to Sunderland\nHe also insisted that Andre Ayew would not be leaving the Liberty Stadium despite speculation linking him with a cash-plus-player move to Sunderland.\nIt is understood Sunderland offered £10million plus Fabio Borini, the former Swansea striker, for the Ghana international who joined the Welsh club on a free transfer from Marseille last summer.\n'Yes, he will be a Swansea player,' Guidolin said.\n'He is important for us, he is a good player.\n'He is too important for our team (to leave).'\nThe Swansea team trained today but will have to wait until Tuesday for their next fixture against West Brom\nJack Cork and Leon Britton in action during the Swansea City Training","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-3421366/Swansea-set-complete-signing-8m-Chievo-striker-Alberto-Paloschi.html"}
