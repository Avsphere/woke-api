Today I learned that the media cares more about creating a story than uncovering the truth. Today I learned that the right of a small group to protest is more important than the entire student body’s right to the education they pay for. Today I learned that one man is responsible for the heinous actions of a few campus racists. Today I learned that not supporting one group protesting racism makes you a racist, even though you support the fight against racism–just not that specific group. Today I am not proud to be a tiger.\nClearly, she’s not alone, given that even a good number of football players didn’t support their teammates boycott that led to the resignation of a university president. Unfortunately, those voices, much like Jessie’s – and the voices of who knows how many other students – just didn’t matter as much to the media.\n“As much as we want to say everyone is united, half the team and coaches—black and white—are pissed,” the unnamed player told ESPN’s Brett McMurphy. “If we were 9-0, this wouldn’t be happening.” “Not everyone agrees with the decision [to stop all football activities],” the player said. “Most people are pissed, including the black guys [on the team].”\nInstead, most mainstream media outlets saw and ran with the underlying Social Justice agenda being pushed by a relatively small number of protesters despite conflicting evidence surrounding recent events.\nThe president of the University of Missouri bowed to pressure Monday and stepped down from his position. It was the end of a sometimes ugly pressure campaign which seemed to have only a tangential connection to the actual outrage that started students down this road.\nThe comments on her Facebook post were mostly positive, as well:","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/10/missouri-students-use-social-media-blast-protesters/"}
