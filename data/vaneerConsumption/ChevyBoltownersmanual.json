General Motors The first 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV electric cars should be arriving in dealerships sometime this month, likely in electric-car friendly California before anywhere else.\nThe launch of the 238-mile electric car is now close enough that General Motors has undertaken the mundane yet critical task of issuing an owner's manual for the car.\nOwner's manuals were traditionally thick tomes lodged in glove boxes and often forgotten by the drivers they were meant to inform.\nRecently, carmakers have begun turning them into pdf files that can be accessed on the go.\nThat's the case with the 2017 Bolt EV owner's manual, which is now available online—even though the first cars do not appear to have been delivered to customers quite yet.\nReading the owner's manual of new car you may consider buying is always a good idea, to familiarize yourself with the car's controls, maintenance requirements, etc.\nThe latter isn't too much of a burden for owners of electric cars.\nOther than regular tire rotations and replacement of the cabin air filter, the only maintenance Bolt EV owner's manual only calls for in the first 150,000 miles is replacement of coolant.\nIt's also worth noting that GM says it expects battery degradation of 10 to 40 percent during the warranty period of 8 years or 100,000 miles.\nThat's according to the warranty information on page 323 of the 361-page document.\nThe manual also indicates that the Bolt EV will accept a charge rate of at least 80 kilowatts for DC fast-charging, notes Inside EVs.\nGM previously described the Bolt EV DC fast-charging system—which uses the CCS protocol—as adding 90 miles of range in 30 minutes.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/chevy-bolt-owners-manual-2016-12"}
