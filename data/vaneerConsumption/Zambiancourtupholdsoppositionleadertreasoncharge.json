The motion to quash the treason charge is untenable,\" he told a packed court in Lusaka.\nHichilema also pleaded not guilty to one charge of disobeying an order to give way to the presidential motorcade and another of using insulting language.\nThe magistrate remanded him in custody as suspects charged with treason are not eligible for bail in Zambia.\nHichilema, a wealthy self-made businessman, has been in custody since police raided his Lusaka home on April 11.\nHis trial on the two lesser charges is scheduled to begin on May 10.\nHichilema made a fifth bid for the Zambian presidency last year and has sought to challenge the legality of the most recent election which he narrowly lost to Lungu.\nThat campaign was marked by clashes between supporters of Lungu's Patriotic Front (PF) party and Hichilema's United Party for National Development (UPND).","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4447236/Zambian-court-upholds-opposition-leader-treason-charge.html"}
