The FBI and Oregon State Police arrested the leaders of an armed group that has occupied a national wildlife refuge for the past three weeks during a traffic stop that prompted gunfire ¿ and one death ¿ along a highway through the frozen high country.

Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum, an Arizona rancher, was shot and killed by police Tuesday during the arrest of most of the armed group's leaders on a highway north of the refuge.\nThe video shows a truck speeding toward a roadblock and hitting a snow bank. Greg Bretzing, special agent in charge for the FBI in Oregon, narrated the video and said that Finicum then got out of the truck.\nThe video appears to show the individual that got out of the truck reaching into his pocket. Bretzing said Finicum had a loaded handgun in his pocket and he \"on at least two occasions\" reached his right hand toward the pocket inside his jacket.\nThe video then shows the man being shot by officers.\nBretzing said Oregon State Troopers fatally shot Finicum after he reached toward his pocket.\nBundy followers had given conflicting accounts of how Finicum died. One said Finicum charged at officers, who then shot him. A member of the Bundy family said Finicum did nothing to provoke the officers.\nThe FBI posted the video to its YouTube channel (http://bit.ly/209MgEw ).\n___\n4:15 p.m.\nA law enforcement official says the Arizona rancher killed during the arrest of an armed group in Oregon was shot after reaching toward his waistband multiple times.\nThe official, who had been briefed on the investigation but spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it by name, said Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum of Arizona was armed, but did not have an opportunity to shoot.\nThe Deschutes County Sheriff's department said in a statement that Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office performed an autopsy Thursday and confirmed the 54-year-old Finicum's identity. The autopsy results were not released.\nAuthorities say the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office will be the lead agency on the police shooting investigation.\nGroup leader Ammon Bundy and seven other main figures in the takeover were arrested earlier in the week, most of them in the traffic stop Tuesday night that erupted in gunfire.\nBundy's group seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon on Jan. 2 to protest federal land use policies.\n— Eric Tucker\n___\n1:25 p.m.\nThe jailed former leader of an armed group occupying an Oregon wildlife refuge reiterated his call for the last few holdouts to leave.\nIn a statement Thursday issued through his lawyer, Ammon Bundy said: \"Turn yourselves in, and do not use physical force.\"\nBundy and others protesting federal land policies were arrested during a traffic stop Tuesday that left one man dead. Bundy's statement says FBI agents told him that the shooting of Arizona rancher Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum was recorded on video.\nHe says he's waiting to review the footage because \"questions must be answered.\"\nBundy supporters have given conflicting accounts about Finicum's death. One said the rancher charged at officers, who then shot him. A member of Bundy's family said Finicum did nothing to provoke the officers.\nAuthorities have refused to release details.\n___\n12 p.m.\nThe last few occupiers of an Oregon wildlife refuge have been posting online videos in which they say they are in negotiations with the FBI and that their numbers are down to four.\nA video posted Thursday to the YouTube channel \"DefendYourBase,\" which the group has been using to give live updates from Malheur National Wildlife Refuge says the occupiers want assurances they won't arrested.\nA speaker believed to be David Fry said: \"We're stuck here, four of us. They're telling us it's safe to leave, but it's not safe.\"\nHe says one of the occupiers faces a federal arrest warrant.\nThe latest videos show them sitting around a campfire near pickup trucks, an American flag, weapons, a tarp and clutter. In one, a couple dances slowly to a country Western tune.\n___\n9:50 a.m.\nA video posted by the holdouts occupying an Oregon wildlife refuge says the remaining five members of the armed group will leave if none of them face arrest.\nThe statement was posted early Thursday to the YouTube channel \"DefendYourBase,\" which the group has been using to give live updates from Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. David Fry has made frequent posts, but no face was visible in the video.\nIt shows a campfire while a man says authorities told the group that \"out of five people left here, four of us are allowed to leave.\"\nThe video says the FBI told them that one of the remaining occupiers faces a federal felony charge. The video says \"we are willing to stay here\" unless authorities agree to drop it.\nThe FBI has established checkpoints around the refuge. Eleven other people have been arrested in connection to the standoff.\nThis photo provided by the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2016, shows Ammon Bundy, one of the members of an armed group occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as part of a dispute over public lands in the Western U.S. Bundy and several others were arrested on Tuesday, Jan. 26, prompting gunfire and leaving one man dead during a traffic stop along a highway in Oregon's frozen high country.
