He says the Satanic Temple doesn't believe in a literal Satan but see the biblical Satan as a metaphor for rebellion against tyranny.\nThe Arizona Republic reports (http://bit.ly/1PEUycc ) that the temple will perform the invocation on Feb. 17.\nThe city's invocation has been delivered by Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs and people of other faiths. The temple submitted a request in December to give the prayer.\n___","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3423194/Satanists-invocation-Phoenix-City-Council-meeting.html"}
