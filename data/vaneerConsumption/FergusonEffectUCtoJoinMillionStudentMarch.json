It has three basic demands, according to its website: free tuition at public universities; forgiveness of all student loans; and a $15 minimum wage. However, many participants have already added expressions of solidarity to the protest, including support for the “#ConcernStudent1950” organization at Missouri, and support for the Palestinian cause.\nNew York City Students for Justice in Palestine, for example, posted its own version of the Million Student March manifesto on Facebook that targeted “Zionists” in the City University of New York administration:\nThe Zionist administration invests in Israeli companies, companies that support the Israeli occupation, hosts birthright programs and study abroad programs in occupied Palestine, and reproduces settler-colonial ideology throughout CUNY through Zionist content of education. While CUNY aims to produce the next generation of professional Zionists, SJP aims to change the university to fight for all peoples liberation.\nVisit Breitbart News for coverage.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/12/ferguson-effect-uc-to-join-million-student-march/"}
