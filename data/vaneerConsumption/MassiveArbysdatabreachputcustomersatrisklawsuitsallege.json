In total, the chain has more than 3,300 restaurants, according to the suit.\nArby’s online database of locations doesn’t indicate which are corporate and which are franchises.\nIn a statement to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the company said it isn’t commenting on the litigation, “except to say that we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them.”\nThe chain has said it immediately notified law enforcement and “enlisted the expertise of leading security experts,” when it learned there could’ve been a breach.\nThe plaintiffs allege Arby’s owes them for all the work it took putting out the fire for customers who feared their cards had been compromised.\nThe suits are filed in federal court in Atlanta because Arby’s has corporate headquarters in Sandy Springs, near the Fulton-DeKalb County line.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/massive-arby-data-breach-put-customers-risk-lawsuits-allege/gGJrn3ncCd9fRT7OrCuAjP/"}
