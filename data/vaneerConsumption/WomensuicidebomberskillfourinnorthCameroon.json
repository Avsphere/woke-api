Many others were hurt.\"\nSecurity forces transport with a blanket the remains of some of the eleven victims of a double blast in the northern Cameroonian city of Maroua on July 22, 2015\nThe member of the vigilante committee set up to ward off such attacks said the assailants were both women and confirmed that six people had died in all, including the bombers.\n\"Five women planned to blow themselves up in Kerawa today but two of them were arrested and the fifth is on the run,\" the member said, adding that one of the arrested women \"is the wife of a Boko Haram chief in the Kerawa region.\"\nThe security source said the attacks were carefully timed as members of the vigilante group had been called to a nearby town to receive silver medals from the local governor for their role in pre-empting Boko Haram attacks.\nThe attacks took place next to a school sheltering people displaced from their homes by Boko Haram's six-year campaign of terror.\nThe jihadists initially confined their war to Nigeria but last year saw a sharp increase in cross-border attacks in Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\nKerawa was the scene of one such assault in September in which 20 people were killed.\nAnd on Monday, at least 37 people died in four suicide attacks at a market in Bodo, also in Cameroon's extreme north.\nNearly 1,200 people have been killed since 2013 when Boko Haram began attacking Cameroon's Far North region bordering the Islamist group's stronghold in northeastern Nigeria, according to government spokesman, Communications Minister Issa Chiroma Bakary.\n- 'Barbaric attacks' -\n\"In total, 1,098 civilians, 67 of our soldiers and three police officials have been killed in these barbaric attacks by the Boko Haram terrorist group,\" he said earlier this month.\nIn that time, officials say there have been more than 30 suicide attacks blamed on Boko Haram, which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group.\nIn recent years, Boko Haram fighters had slipped back and forth across the frontier, often using Cameroon's remote north as a rear base, acquiring arms, vehicles and supplies there.\nBut since late November, the Cameroon army has carried out operations in several border areas aimed at weakening Nigerian jihadists active in the region, with sources saying the raids have significantly weakened Boko Haram's capabilities.\nAs a result, the insurgents turned away from direct confrontation with the military in favour of suicide attacks, increasingly staged by women and girls.\nThe Nigeria-based jihadists have killed at least 17,000 people and made more than 2.6 million others homeless since their six-year campaign began.\nCameroon has meanwhile banned the Islamic veil in a bid to pre-empt suicide bombings staged by attackers wearing the full-face veil.\nAlong with Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Benin, Cameroon is part of a regional military force fighting the jihadists.\nDespite the offensives launched by the regional force, the group maintains strongholds in areas that are difficult to access, such as the Sambisa forest, the Mandara mountains and the numerous islands of Lake Chad.\nCameroon security forces speak with locals after a twin suicide attack in the extreme north village of Kolofata on September 13, 2015 Â©- (AFP/File)","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420942/Four-killed-twin-suicide-attack-north-Cameroon.html"}
