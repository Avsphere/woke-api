The 28-year-old man is jailed without bond pending a March 22 detention hearing. If convicted, he faces up to five years in federal prison.\nHis attorney declined to comment.\nCourt records show Chestnut called Fort Hood saying he's an ex-soldier wrongly accused of a crime. Chestnut said he would shoot soldiers at the post if he didn't receive back pay.\nIn 2009, 13 people were killed and 31 others wounded in a shooting at Fort Hood. Nidal Hasan, a former U.S. Army major, was convicted and sentenced to death in that shooting.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4318454/Ex-soldier-accused-threatening-Fort-Hood-shooting-rampage.html"}
