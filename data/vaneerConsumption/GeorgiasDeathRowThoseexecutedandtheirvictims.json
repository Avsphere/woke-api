Debate continues regarding capital punishment in Georgia and around the U.S. as those who protest the practice contend that it's exactly the sort of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" banned by the Constitution while those in favor of capital punishment argue that the victims of those convicted had lives and futures, too, that were criminally taken from them. Here's a look at some of those who were put to death in Georgia and their victims.\n2 / 85\nW.A. BRIDGES JR. / AJC FILE Death by electrocution (1924-72; 1976-2000): The electric chair at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center in Jackson was once the state's sole method of execution after the General Assembly outlawed hanging in 1924. Electrocution was used to put prisoners to death from 1924-1972. When the death penalty was reinstated nationally in 1976, electrocution was also reintroduced. In 2000, the Georgia General Assembly passed a law instituting lethal injection as the state's method of execution, ending the use of the so-called \"electric chair.\" Terry Mincey became the first prisoner executed by lethal injection in October 2001. The following inmates shown in this gallery, up through Terry Mincey in 2001, were all electrocuted.\n3 / 85\nMACON TELEGRAPH / FILE JOHN ELDON SMITH: Smith was the first person executed in Georgia since the U.S. Supreme Court suspended capital punishment from 1972-76.

Tackett stayed late after the business's close in order to complete paperwork so that he would be free to spend Fatherâs Day with his young daughter. Jonesâ partner in the burglary-murder, Van Roosevelt Solomon, was electrocuted in 1985. Jonesâ case took longer in the appeals process than Solomonâs because a federal judge in 1989 ordered a resentencing once it was revealed that the jury in his trial had a Bible in the room while they deliberated. In 1997, Jones was sentenced to die for a second time. He was executed on Feb. 3 2016.
