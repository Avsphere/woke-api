You don't want to mess with Harrison Ford.'\nHot lunch: The waitress may have gone weak at the knees when she stopped by Ryan's table\nCarrying his Notebook: He was carrying a booklet that may have contained his innermost secrets and wise musings\nAn understandable viewpoint, as there are few pugilistic opponents more dangerous than a 74-year-old man who acts for a living.\nBlade Runner 2, which also features Robin Wright and Dave Bautista, is to hit cinemas sooner than expected.\nTaking place a few decades after the events of the first film, it is set to hit theaters on October 6 2017, months ahead of its originally planned February 2018 release.\nRyan plays the new blade runner, an LAPD Officer who works to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who disappeared thirty years earlier, after discovering a dark secret that might bring an end to humanity.\nBut did he have the Canadian ham? The Ontario native my have fancied a taste of home\nOn pointe: Perhaps the noted ballet exponent was heading off for a session in the studio\nGiven Deckard was, in director Ridley Scott's opinion, a replicant in the first film, it seems understandable Harrison's character may be trying to lie low in the forthcoming feature.\nRidley previously explained: 'We talked at length about what it could be, and came up with a pretty strong three-act storyline, and it all makes sense in terms of how it relates to the first one.\n'Harrison is very much part of this one, but really it's about finding him. He comes in in the third act.'\nAnd off he goes: Or perhaps he was going to indulge in his self-confessed love of knitting","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4446130/Ryan-Gosling-grips-notebook-heads-lunch.html"}
