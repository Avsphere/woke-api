In the absence of such a close beneath 94.20, let's watch price behavior in and around both the 5 DMA, now at 94.85, and the 20 DMA, now at 94.67. A close beneath the 5 and 20 DMA's will argue strongly for downside continuation that breaks the dominant recovery up trendline at 94.20. Last is 94.56.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/dollar-looks-like-its-topping-2018-7"}
