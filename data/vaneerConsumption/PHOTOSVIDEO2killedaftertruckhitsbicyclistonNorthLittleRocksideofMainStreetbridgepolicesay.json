Brian Dedrick.\nAs the pickup continued traveling the wrong way, reportedly at a high rate of speed, a bicyclist traveling northbound toward North Little Rock was fatally hit, Dedrick told reporters at the scene.\nThe Ford then hit the concrete barriers of the bridge, causing the driver to be ejected and also fatally injured, according to police.\nDedrick noted that the driver of the Ford had left the scene of another accident at 5th and Main streets moments before, stopping briefly to speak with the victim of that crash before fleeing in the direction of the Main Street bridge.\n“We’ve got numerous witnesses saying that he was going very fast away from that accident. Also coming across the bridge,” Dedrick said.\nPolice said the pickup hit concrete barriers on both sides of the bridge multiple times. Heavy damage was reported to the truck, including a driver’s-side door that was “almost completely off.”\nThe driver was found about 20 feet from his pickup on the span, authorities noted.\nIt was not immediately clear whether that driver was wearing a seat belt or whether the bicyclist was wearing a helmet at the time of the crash.\nThe identities of the wrong-way driver and bicyclist, both black males, were not released Wednesday evening pending notification to next of kin. Their bodies were expected to be sent to the state Crime Laboratory for autopsies.\nThe bridge was opened to traffic as of 5:40 p.m. after crews worked the scene.\nRead Thursday’s Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.\nClick here for larger versions\nPhotos by Brandon Riddle","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/mar/15/police-1-dead-after-car-hits-pedestrian-main-stree/"}
