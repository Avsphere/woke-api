ISIS social-media channels distributed a holiday attack list of churches in the US. A series of messages from a pro-ISIS group on Telegram announced the group's plans to utilise its network of lone wolf attackers to \"turn the Christian New Year into a bloody horror movie.\"\n10. China's smog is so bad right now, masks and filters are starting to sell out. Online orders have poured in for anti-smog products, with e-commerce firms and brands reporting record demand in response to \"red alert\" warnings in 24 cities this week.
