At some point he will propose a Muslim Hunger Games, I think honestly, with Donald Trump. He’s alarming, he doesn’t understand the nuance and the ideas of, like, ‘Let’s ban all Muslims, Islam hates us, let’s do surveillance of these people.’ It’s bone chilling and plays into what ISIS wants. Our elected officials to say to tell Muslims in the West, ‘You’re hated by our leaders, so join us.’ Donald Trump helps ISIS more than America right now.”\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/07/16/dean-obeidallah-trump-will-propose-a-muslim-hunger-games-helps-islamic-state-more-than-u-s/"}
