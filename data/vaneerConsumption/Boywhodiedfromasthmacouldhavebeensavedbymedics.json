An inquest has been told of failures in his care\nCoroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe found that if the Royal Free Hospital had kept him in for treatment instead of sending him home he might not have died.\nIn her conclusions on Thursday at Westminster Coroner's Court she made a national recommendation to try and prevent future similar deaths.\nDr Radcliffe concluded that if Michael had remained in hospital on a high dose of steroids with a referral to a respiratory specialist 'it's unlikely he would have died'.\nShe said that by the second attendance at A&E in 24 hours 'alarm bells should have begun to ring'.\nShe added that a 'totally inadequate history was obtained' after the paediatrician who treated him on the second admission failed to realise he had been there the previous day.\n'The opportunity was lost to recognise this as a serious problem - the history and signs were there to be seen and understood.\n'But sadly it wasn't recognised and he was discharged essentially on the same treatment he had been on,' she added.\nSeven other children in London have died from asthma since Michael's death, the inquest was told.\nDespite being taken to hospital twice before his death, he tragically later of an asthma attack\nThe inquest heard Dr Sherine Dewlett treated him on August 19, the second time his parents had taken him to A&E in 24 hours.\nThe doctor had no idea that Michael had also been in the day before and did not properly read his medical notes, Westminster Coroner's Court heard.\n'My impression was he had only just come in for one day - I didn't have notes from the 18th,' she added.\nDr Dewlett said she discussed Michael's history with his mother but failed to discover that he had been to A&E the day before or get full details of a previous visit in January.\nA coroner slammed the 'totally inadequate history-taking' by NHS staff before his death\nShe also had no idea he had been taking steroids for seven days, the inquest heard.\n'I thought he had only just come in and been started on steroids that day, she added.\nCoroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said there was 'no appreciation of the duration of the symptoms' and also questioned why no peak flow breathing tests had been carried out.\nShe added: 'Here is a mother, undoubtedly anxious, undoubtedly worried, who has had to go to the A&E department on the 18th and then come back to the A&E in the early hours of the morning.\n'She's got two young twins at home - people don't do that unless they're really worried.\n'It's a really anxious situation, yet you don't seem to have considered everything in any great detail.'\nDr Dewlett replied: 'I don't think I appreciated the level of concern.'\nWhen asked why she did not have Michael's full medical notes, she said: 'The notes weren't printed out and I don't think they had been scanned on the computer yet.'\nDr Dewlett later admitted that there were references to the earlier visit in his paperwork.\n'If I had properly looked I would have realised that (he had come in before),' she added.\nShe continued: 'When I looked at the notes after his death I was really upset - I realised he had been in on the 18th.'\nThe coroner said: 'Alarm bells should have been ringing in A&E if a child attends twice in 24 hours from the same condition - I would hope so and expect so.'\nThe Royal Free Hospital carried out two internal investigations after Michael's death\nShe added that there was a 'totally inadequate history-taking' to properly assess his long-term condition.\nMichael, from St John's Wood, north-west London, died on August 25 2015 after suffering a chronic asthma attack.\nHe was also seen by NHS GPs, as well as having private doctor appointments, in the months before he died.\nExpert respiratory pediatrician Dr Richard Iles said his death was preventable and he should have been referred to a specialist.\nHe told the inquest that the repeated courses of steroids and acute attacks were all signs that his care programme was not working.\n'High doses of steroids should set an alarm ringing in people's ears - this child needed steroids to stay well.'\nHe added: 'This child had a long-term condition - it was managed as an acute event.'\nThe Royal Free Hospital carried out two internal investigations after Michael's death and concluded that staff failed to diagnose him with chronic asthma and the care he was given was not adequate.\nThe hospital has since appointed two specialist respiratory clinicians, opened a dedicated asthma clinic and implemented a new strategy for treating children with asthma.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4320718/Paediatrician-didn-t-check-boy-s-history-died.html"}
