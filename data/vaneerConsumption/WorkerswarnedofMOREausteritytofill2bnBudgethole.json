But the idea has now been abandoned entirely, leaving him with a yawning gap in the finances.\nIn his letter to Tory MPs yesterday, Mr Hammond made clear he still wanted to narrow the difference in the tax treatment for the employed and the self-employed.\nHe said a review into the issue would be extended 'to look at other areas of differences in treatment'.\nThe £2 billion shortfall will be 'funded by measures announced in the autumn budget', he said.\nCoalition pensions minister Steve Webb suggested a cut in pension tax relief could be Mr Hammond's solution.\nFormer pensions minister Steve Webb suggested that a cut in pension tax relief could be used to plug the gap in the Budget\nMr Webb ran pensions policy during the coalition and has a detailed understanding of the reliefs involved and reforms which could be considered\nNo 10 refused to comment on the speculation today.\nTheresa May's official spokesman said: 'The Chancellor yesterday said the implications for the public finances would be addressed in the autumn statement.\n'I've no comment beyond that.'\nThe Prime Minister herself expressed confidence in her Chancellor today.\nAsked if she had ever thought he should resign, Mrs May told ITV News: 'I have absolute faith in the Chancellor. We made very clear yesterday - he and I - about the tax lock, that we recognised the spirit of the manifesto and the change has been made.'\nDespite the declaration of confidence, relations between the residents of Downing Street appear to have plunged to a new low after the PM forced Mr Hammond into an humiliating climbdown over the key Budget measure.\nMrs May told the Chancellor his hike to Class 4 National Insurance, which smashed a Tory manifesto pledge, had to be scrapped at a tense 8am meeting yesterday.\nMr Hammond has to fill the hole in the Budget after he was ordered by Prime Minister Theresa May to drop a rise in class four National Insurance Contributions yesterday\nMr Hammond made the embarrassing announcement in a letter to MPs shortly before Mrs May took Prime Minister's Questions - easily fending off a weak response from Jeremy Corbyn.\nThe row has laid bare the growing friction between the holders of the two most important roles in government, with the PM taking the opportunity to stamp her authority.\nMrs May's aides are believed to have been particularly infuriated by briefing to Sunday papers from 'friends' of the Chancellor, complaining of 'economic illiteracy' in No10 and saying they had been pressing for the Budget to raise more money.\nAccording to The Times, Mrs May's team warned the Treasury before the fateful package was announced that raising NI for the self-employed was a 'bad idea'.\n'No 10 said don't do it, but Philip wouldn't listen,' a ministerial source said.\nThe screeching U-turn has dealt a massive blow to the standing of the Chancellor, who previously held a reputation in Westminster as a safe pair of hands.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319560/Workers-warned-austerity-2bn-Budget-hole.html"}
