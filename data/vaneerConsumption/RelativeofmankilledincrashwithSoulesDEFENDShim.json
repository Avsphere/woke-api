Mosher, 66, died after being rushed to the hospital\nAfter the crash: Here a sheriff's car from Buchanan County is seen near the scene of the crash with an ambulance in the background\n'This is corn planting time, the best time of the year for a farmer. Kenny was working on one of the farms just a little north of Aurora and I think he was just coming home. For Chris, what happened was a freak accident.'\nSoules, 35, was accused of 'slamming into a tractor and then fleeing the scene'. The driver, 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, died after being rushed to the hospital.\nRoepke explained that the reality star comes from a good family, is well-vested in farming, and has 'a great life ahead of him'.\nHe continued: 'This is a serious bump in the road and I don't know about this (alleged) alcohol issue but I just know that this was a huge mistake.\n'It's something he's going to have to deal with for the rest of his life. It just ended very tragically'.\nRoepke later said Mosher, a husband, father and grandfather, will be remembered as a hardworking farmer whose passion was planting corn.\n'He loved farming and cared about the land. He was doing his business, taking care of business. The Mosher's are in shock and still trying to process it all,' he told People.\nMosher is survived by wife Nancy, their two sons and three grandchildren - two boys and a girl.\nFamily man: Mosher, 66, is pictured in this undated Facebook photo with his wife, Nancy, and their three grandchildren\nFirst appearance: Soules appeared in an Iowa court Tuesday morning (pictured) for his arraignment in connection to the deadly crash\nDressed in a lime-green jail garb, orange slippers and gray socks, Soules appeared before a judge in a Buchanan County courtroom Tuesday morning and was ordered held on $10,000 bond, reported the station KWWL.\nSoules was released from jail at around midday after his mother, Linda, posted bond on his behalf, reported Des Moines Register. He will be required to surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet until his trial, jail officials said.\nSoules is due back in court for a preliminary hearing on May 2.\nAccording to the Buchanan County Sheriffâ€™s Office, Soules has been charged with 'leaving the scene of a fatal car accident that left one individual dead.'\nThe 35-year-old was driving a Chevy pickup at the time of the accident. He has posed with a grey Chevy Silverado on Instagram and has also recently posted a photo of a white Chevy.\nAccording to the sheriff's office, Soules rear-ended a John Deere tractor driven by Kenneth Mosher, his fellow farmer from Aurora, sending it into a ditch.\nPatrol cars with the Buchanan County Sheriff's Office and Iowa State Patrol are seen outside Chris Soules' home on Tuesday\nThe deadly crash took place on this roadway near Aurora, where Mosher lived with his family\nMosher, who reportedly was acquainted with Soules, died after he was taken to Mercy Hospital in Oelwein.\nSoules left the scene of the accident, but kept his car at the site. It is not known if he left by foot or with the help of another driver.\nAuthorities said someone called 911 to report the crash, but they didn't release the identity of the caller or audio of the call. Investigators spoke to multiple witnesses and determined that Soules caused the crash, according to a complaint.\nHe was arrested five hours later in Aurora. Buchanan County Attorney said Soules has not been cooperative with law enforcement.\nSoules' spokesman, Stan Rosenfield, issued a statement saying the Bachelor alum 'was devastated' to learn that Mosher died.\n'His thoughts and prayers and with Mr. Mosher's family,' said Rosenfield, who declined to comment further.\nThe wheels: The pickup truck on the left may have been the car Chris was driving at the time of the accident. He has also posted a photo of a white Chevy (right) in recent days\nHe was 'on top of the world' four days ago': Soules was last seen on top of the Empire State Building in NYC on Friday\nSoules wore a blue Soules T-shirt in his mugshot and appeared as if he had just been crying.\nJust four days earlier, the Bachelor alum looked to be in good spirits in New York City in an Instagram photo.\nHe said he was 'on top of the world' as he posed atop the Empire State building.\nA week ago, he posed in Nashville at the 16th Annual Waiting for Wishes Celebrity Dinner Hosted by Kevin Carter & Jay DeMarcus.\nRose man: He appeared on the 10th season of The Bachelorette with Andi Dorfman and was cast on the 19th season of ABC's The Bachelor\nThis was not Soules' first brush with the law: Iowa court records show that he was convicted of driving while intoxicated in 2006 and fined more than $500. His sentence also included a year of probation.\nBesides that conviction, Soules' history of run-ins with the law stretches back to at least 1998 and includes more than a dozen guilty pleas on a slew of charges running the gamut from registration violations to brawling.\nNearly two decades ago, Soules, then a teenager, was convicted of speeding six to 10 miles over the speed limit and was sentenced to a fine.\nIn 2001, Soules was found guilty of underage drinking and failure to maintain control of a vehicle in two unrelated incidents. Both cases saw the future reality star get off with fines.\nIn May and August of that year, Soules was convicted twice of possession of alcohols under age. In the latter incident, he was also found guilty of driving with an open container of alcohol, running a stop sign and speeding. Those cases also resulted in fines.\nIn February 2002, Soules was convicted of fighting, and in March he was back in court on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident, which was later reduced to a count of defective brakes.\nSoules stayed out of trouble for four years until his 2006 DUI conviction. A year later, he was found guilty of speeding, and the same charge brought him back to court in 2009.\nIn 2010, Soules was convicted and fined for a registration violation. Between that incident and his arrest on Monday, the celebrity farmer had no additional brushes with the law.\nThe Iowa native appeared on the 10th season of The Bachelorette with Andi Dorfman, where he placed third.\nSoules was then cast on the 19th season of ABC's The Bachelor.\nHe proposed to finalist Whitney Bischoff but they ended their engagement in May 2015.\nHe also competed on ABC's Dancing with the Stars.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446386/Relative-man-killed-crash-Soules-DEFENDS-him.html"}
