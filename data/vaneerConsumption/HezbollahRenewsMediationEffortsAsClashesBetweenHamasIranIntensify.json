Even though a Hamas delegation visited Iran earlier this year for the 37th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, none of the participants were top-level leaders.\nHamas has told Hezbollah that it demands an official apology for Aruj’s comments, which Iran has so far refused to issue, the Hamas official told Breitbart Jerusalem.\nBreitbart Jerusalem reported last month that Hamas’ military wing has called for stronger ties with Iran following the Turkish-Israeli rapprochement.\nAlthough Hamas congratulated Turkey for its efforts to alleviate Israel’s siege of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, the movement came to realize that it would lead to no major changes on the ground, a Hamas source said.\nOnly restoring strategic ties with Iran, the source said, will allow Hamas to rearm and replenish its coffers. This view is shared by the Gaza leadership of Hamas, who are less exposed to pressure from other Arab countries that has led the leadership abroad to reject Iranian overtures, the source added.\n“The external leadership will struggle to last very long, because Arab pressure is not backed up with cash,” he said. “And in any event, the Arab countries back Egypt’s efforts to restore Palestinian Authority control over Gaza.”\n“The Turks are very proud that large amounts of humanitarian aid enter the Strip, but that’s an internal Turkish issue because that happens already on a daily basis,” he said.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/07/13/hezbollah-renews-mediation-efforts-clashes-hamas-iran-reach-new-heights/"}
