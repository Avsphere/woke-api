That’s been repeated constantly, and I think it’s worth noting that if there is a link here, that the publication was being targeted, that that kind of rhetoric can be very dangerous in these times.”\nFollow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/06/28/cnns-rangappa-if-there-is-a-link-that-capital-gazette-was-targeted-rhetoric-that-press-is-enemy-can-be-very-dangerous/"}
