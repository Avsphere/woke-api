In March 2018, the federal government spent $39.67 per WIC recipient, according to the USDA data.\nThe last time the government spent less money on each WIC recipient was in 2007 when it spent an average of $39.04 for each WIC recipient.\nWIC is a government grant-funded welfare program that provides food assistance to pregnant and nursing women, infants, and children up to five years of age, according to the USDA.\nThe program, which primarily focuses on nutrition, began as a pilot program in 1972 under the Nixon administration and became a permanent fixture of the U.S. welfare system in 1974.\nMost WIC programs are administered through individual states, which hand out vouchers that can be used to purchase food at participating retailers.\nTotal participation in the WIC program went up every year since its inception until 2011, when participation in the program began declining due to a decrease in birth rates and an improvement in the U.S. economy since the 2008 recession.\nTrumpâ€™s latest push to get off entitlement reforms might drive these numbers down even further, especially as the Trump administration released an executive order April aiming to reform welfare. The order aimed to increase investment in workforce development programs and require the USDA to issue updated requirements for receiving benefits such as WIC and food stamps.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/06/19/wic-welfare-participation-lowest-level-24-years/"}
