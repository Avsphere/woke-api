In 2002, the city increased the possible fine for the crime up to $500, but that did little to deter it.\nLast summer, the city painted nearly 30 walls with a repellent paint that makes urine spray back on the offender.\nSolar-powered toilets roll through city streets several afternoons a week. And city crews have inspected 10,000 light posts to make sure they won't fall over from erosion.\nAlong with the open-air urinal, attendants are manning 10 public toilets to encourage people to use them\nThat comes after a three-story-tall light post corroded by a likely mix of human and dog urine, and weighed down by a large banner, toppled.\nAlong with the open-air urinal, attendants are manning 10 public toilets to encourage people to use them.\nThey clean and restock supplies and make sure people don't use drugs or sleep inside the restrooms.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423062/It-s-OK-pee-public-San-Francisco-gets-open-air-urinal-city-park-stop-people-relieving-bushes.html"}
