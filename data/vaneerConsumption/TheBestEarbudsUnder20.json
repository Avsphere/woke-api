They're both compatible with most devices, including Apple and Android, and come in nine striking colors, from black (pictured) to hot pink. Fit-wise, these earbuds come with three different-sized ear pads — you just pick the one that fits your ears the best — and have a 3.6-foot cord that can be threaded through your clothing or bag for tangle-free wear. Plus, the large 9-millimeter drivers deliver powerful, clear sound as they prevent background noise. What fans say: \"These earbuds are much better than most for their price range. They are long lasting and fairly durable, play sound well, and are comfortable in the ear.\"\n2 Attractive & Noise-Isolating Earbuds With Bass Betron YSM1000 Earbuds $14 Amazon See On Amazon The Betron YSM1000 earbuds look as great as they sound.
