That was until last weekend.\nThe picture, which included the Portuguese manager alongside Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry with last season's Capital One Cup and Premier League trophies, was removed before Chelsea played Scunthorpe United in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday.\nThe 2015-16 team photograph that includes both the Premier League and Capital One Cup trophies\nTeam picture of the squad that began the 2014-15 season for Chelsea managed by Jose Mourinho\nChelsea fans had made it their routine to get a picture stood next to Mourinho and Chelsea's John Terry\nThe image in its place now is an adidas and Delta sponsors montage with the slogans: 'If it's not blue, it will not do. #bethedifference' and 'Keeping the blue flag flying high'.\nMourinho was sacked as Chelsea manager on December 17 after a poor run of performances including nine defeats in 16 games and ill feeling in the dressing room left owner Roman Abramovich with no choice but to relieve the 52-year-old of his duties.\nMourinho's second spell at Stamford Bridge reaped the club their fourth Premier League title and a fifth League Cup.\nHis defence of the Premier League crown was going disastrously before he was sacked, which further added fuel to the argument that the Portuguese manager finds it difficult to maintain momentum when his time with a club goes to a third season.\nGuus Hiddink was appointed as Chelsea's new manager on December 19 and has attempted to guide the team back on to the road to recovery.\nThe west London club are yet to lose a game under the Dutchman and earned an FA Cup fourth round spot on Sunday after beating Scunthorpe United 2-0 at Stamford Bridge.\nBlue is the colour: Team photograph replaced by adidas advert featuring some of Chelsea's players\nA Chelsea fan poses next to the club's badge and the slogan: 'If it's not blue, it will be #thedifference'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3393966/All-memory-Jose-Mourinho-s-torrid-second-spell-Chelsea-erased-team-photo-Stamford-Bridge-removed.html"}
