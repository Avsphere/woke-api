My life now has a huge void.\n'In some ways I have lost half of me - we were two halves of a whole person for our parents.'\nDefending, Lisa Wilding QC described Mr Hulme's death as 'a result of tomfoolery' caused by 'the unluckiest blow' to the victim's head.\nShe said Thomson had used alcohol as a coping mechanism during various periods in his life, including after the deaths of his two brothers, but said he was now committed to abstaining from drink.\nShe said: 'He is properly described as traumatised and tormented by the irreparable damage caused to Mr Hulme's family. None of that seeks to excuse his actions.'\nMembers of Thomson's family wept as he was led from the court.\nThomson, who pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, shut his eyes tightly as received his sentence.\nThomson, who had secured a new job in the financial sector in Notting Hill, west London shortly before the attack, had been due to face trial at the Old Bailey\nSpeaking after the sentence had been handed down, Thomas Hulme's family said: 'As a family, we are still in disbelief. Our devastating loss means we are now living life with immense sadness.\n'We no longer have the future we imagined and Tom does not have the life he planned and dreamed of. We miss Tom so much.'\nDetective Inspector Sam Toprak from the City of London Police Major Crime Team said: 'The two men were friends and had been enjoying a night out when, what started as a prank, ended in tragedy.\n'This was a senseless act that has left Thomas Hulme's family understandably devastated.\n'While nothing will change what has happened I hope that today's sentence will go some way to bring them some closure on this heart-breaking time.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4300374/City-worker-killed-colleague-one-punch-jailed.html"}
