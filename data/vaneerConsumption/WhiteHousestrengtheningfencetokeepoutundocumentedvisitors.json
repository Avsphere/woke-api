It's a hateful and misguided effort rife with prejudice and discrimination. People who come to the White House do so as an act of love, to affirm their connection with our nation. Many do so in search of a better life, and their presence only improves the White House. A country that is a nation of immigrants must also contain a White House of immigrants, no? But with a stout fence keeping people out, who will cut the lawns at the White House? Who will perform maid service? And who will perform janitorial duties in the Situation Room? These are jobs Americans won't do. The White House chooses to stigmatize these undocumented visitors. Yes, they could wait in line and show an ID to get in, but asking for identification is clearly racist, especially for blacks and Hispanics, who don't have...

 a \"smart barrier\" – cameras and sensors – to keep track of who is entering the grounds. At every entrance to the White House should be a sign-in sheet where those entering have to put their names and addresses and check a box indicating whether they've ever been convicted of a felony. As long as they haven't committed any crimes, or at least say they haven't, why should this be a problem? After all, our own homeland security department is vetting undocumented immigrants largely relying on those immigrants' own self-reporting. Why not do the same for undocumented visitors to the White House? Just think: do we really want undocumented visitors to the White House to be lurking in the shadows? Should the Secret Service be in the business of arresting anyone who comes on the grounds simply because he or she lacks documentation? What's wrong with day laborers who want to hang out in the backyard of the White House? It is the people's house, isn't it? It's bad enough when the Secret Service arrests undocumented visitors, but almost as bad is asking them to leave. This \"self-deport\" option runs the real risk of separating families, if one family member is caught and evicted while others are still roaming the White House grounds. Do we really want to be a White House that breaks up families? I also think that there should be special privileges for young undocumented visitors, or DREAMers, as I call them. They should be allowed to roam the family wing of the White House as they wish. Children like to play with other children, and it is only natural that young visitors to the White House would want to meet Sasha and Malia. They should also be given food, clothes, and places to sleep in the White House. After all, even if their parents have broken the law by coming onto the White House grounds without documentation, their children shouldn't be punished for that. Don't you agree?
