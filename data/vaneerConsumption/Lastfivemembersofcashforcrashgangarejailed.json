Mr Cook avoided trial after admitting conspiracy to defraud, but was still handed a 28-month prison sentence.\nOn Friday, Mrs Cook begged not to be sent to jail - despite a jury returning a guilty verdict on her £38,000 fraud.\nIn her mitigation, the mother-of-two claimed she was too unwell to go jail and prison would have devastating consequences for her family.\nHowever, Judge Williams rejected suggestions she had been coerced by her husband into the scam.\nHe added: 'You were motivated by greed - to you it was easy money and both you and your husband profited from it. You have been excruciatingly dishonest.'\nStephen Pegram - who is already serving a five-year jail term - was given further time inside.\nJudge Williams said Pegram had been a close friend of the Yandell family and the culpability for his £19,000 fraud was high.\n'The appropriate sentence for you is six months, which will run consecutively with your existing prison sentence,' the judge added.\nThe court also heard former nurse Rees had played a 'lesser' role in the conspiracy - while Palmer had been 'a naive 21-year-old' at the time of her offence.\nThe pair were handed nine and six-month prison sentences - which were both suspended for two years - as well as having to carry out unpaid work.\nBrooks was also given a suspended jail term as well as a three-month curfew.\nJudge Daniel Williams said: 'Each of you knew that money was about to be made by falsely claiming involvement in car accidents.\n'Each claim involved dishonesty over a long time and thousands upon thousands of pounds were paid out by insurance companies who were blind to your activities.\n'The cost to insurance companies was immense and your preparedness to make false claims has spawned an industry.\n'The cost of this fraud has been passed on in increased premiums for other motorists.\n'Each of you played a significant role in the fraud.'\nRachel Yandell, 31 was charged with conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to steal/handling and sentenced to 60 months, while Gavin Yandell, 31, got 36 months in prison\nDetective Chief Inspector Richard Williams said he was pleased with the strong message the court had sent out.\nHe said: 'Hopefully from this day onwards this type of crime will be less difficult to commit.\n'This investigation was very complex due to the number of defendants involved - it was a difficult process.\n'It not only cost the insurance industry hundreds of thousands but also has probably had a knock on effect to motorists in pushing up their premiums too.\n'These latest sentences send out a strong message and should act as deterrent to others.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423230/Last-five-members-cash-crash-gang-scammed-insurance-companies-800-000-jailed.html"}
