The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nIt was the lovely Suzanne who spotted it...\nIt was a few summers ago now, over our morning cup of tea, when she pointed me to a curious little item in the New York Times about an unlikely racehorse with a funny name that - against all odds - was making a big name for itself in that Mecca of racing, Saratoga. And a paragraph in, I was hooked.\nIt was just so...unusual. A small time horse trainer - a curmudgeonly little guy known for his utter lack of sentiment where it came to horseflesh - had used his meager life savings to buy a thoroughbred reject: a lame, club footed, half blind filly so slow her sellers joked that \"you could time her with a sundial.\" And why would he do such a foolish thing? Because the horse reminded him of his dead wife...who promised, on her deathbed, to come back as a horse. A little weird? Well, yes. But the capper was that somehow, up there in Saratoga, this reject had just blown away some of the fastest fillies in the world. Oh, and her name was \"Lisa's Booby Trap.\"\nWell. Couldn't miss this.\nWhat I didn't count on was how emotional it was going to be.\nRacing season in Saratoga is steeped in history; you feel it everywhere in the giant old grandstand, on the groomed pathways that look out on both dirt and grass racetracks, and in the thoroughbred stables where, one August morning, I met Lisa's Booby Trap.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/reporters-notebook-meeting-lisas-booby-trap-n96621"}
