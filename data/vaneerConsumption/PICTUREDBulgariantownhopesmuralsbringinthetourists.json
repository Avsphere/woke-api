Homeowners are depicted with personalities including Pope Francis, Queen Elizabeth II, Albert Einstein, the Dalai Lama, Angela Merkel, Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Barack Obama and Fidel Castro. Even a Bulgarian is up on the wall: former strongman Todor Zhivkov.\nThe man behind the project is local artist Ventsislav Piryankov, who now lives and works in Poland, where he created an art school. Last summer, Piryankov and his students came to the village for what they called the \"First Mural Festival,\" creating an outdoor art gallery with Banksy-style graffiti on the walls.\nIvan, resident of the Staro Zhelezare village poses in front of a mural depicting his own portrait sitting next to the US President Barak Obama in the Bulgarian village of Staro Zhelezare on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2016.

Before the murals, the village had been best known for a nearby prehistoric stone circle. Now, its cash-strapped residents hope the art project will attract more tourists.\n\"This is something good for the people of our village,\" says Minka Plyuvkova, who works in the library.\nStefana Gospodinova, 64, poses next to the mural depicting herself with her donkey and French former actress Brigitte Bardot, in the Bulgarian village of Staro Zhelezare on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2016.
