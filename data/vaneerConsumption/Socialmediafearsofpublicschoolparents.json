We are intrigued to see worries about self-esteem and confidence; fear of unhealthy friendships and/or liaisons; addictive habits and activities.\n‘We are responding by offering expert talks and parental workshops, we’re developing materials and we’re working with state schools to share as widely as possible what we find.’\nA quarter of respondents had children aged 13 to 14 while another quarter of parents had children aged 16 to 17 years old and the rest were of other senior school age groups.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446000/Internet-porn-fears-public-school-parents.html"}
