Court documents released on Monday said that between 500,000 and 1 million machines worldwide were infected with the malicious software, or malware.\nIts primary purpose was to capture banking credentials, though it has been known to change recipients of legitimate payments orders, for example targeting U.S. hospitals' payroll operations.\nA botnet is a group of computers under the control of someone other than the computers' owners. They are typically assembled through viruses and are the key tool in spam, online bank fraud and denial-of-service attacks on websites.\nGOZ was also used to distribute Cryptolocker, malicious software known as \"ransomware\" that encrypts data of an infected computer, making it inaccessible to the user. Cybercriminals would essentially take the machine hostage, promising to unscramble the data if the user paid them a ransom of as much as $700, the Justice Department said.\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security set up a website to help victims remove the GOZ malware: https://www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus. The European Cybercrime Centre also participated in the operation, along with Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.\nIntel, Microsoft, security software companies F-secure, Symantec, and Trend Micro; and Carnegie Mellon University also supported the operation.\nThe U.S. government kept the effort secret until Monday when it unsealed a 14-count indictment accusing Russian national Evgeniy Mikhaylovich Bogachev of involvement in the alleged conspiracy.\nThe suspect, who authorities said is known online as Lucky12345, is charged with writing computer code used to compromise banking systems and assist others in stealing banking credentials, according to court documents.\nProsecutors said the victims of the attacks included Capital One Bank, Bank of Georgetown in Washington, and First National Bank of Omaha. Bogachev and his group infected thousands of business computers with software that captured passwords, account numbers and other information used to log in to online bank accounts, prosecutors said.\nâ€” Reuters","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/global-police-crack-down-gameover-zeus-cybercrime-botnet-n120581"}
