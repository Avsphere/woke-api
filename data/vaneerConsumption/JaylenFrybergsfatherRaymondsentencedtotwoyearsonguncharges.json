He was convicted in September of illegally owning six firearms, including the gun that his 15-year-old son used in the 2014 school shooting.\nA domestic violence protection order filed by Raymond Fryberg's former partner in Tulalip Tribal Court should have kept him from owning a gun. But a record of the 2002 order never made it into any state or federal criminal databases used by firearms dealers conducting background checks during gun purchases.\nDad learns his fate: Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr, the father of a teenager who used his gun to kill four classmates and then himself in 2014,. exits the US District Court Monday after being sentenced to two years\nTeen shooter: On October 14, 2014, Jaylen Fryberg, 15, used one of his dad's guns at Marysville Pilchuck High School north of Seattle to kill four classmates and injure a fifth\nRaymond Fryberg was convicted in September of illegally owning six firearms, including the gun that his 15-year-old son used in the massacre\nTemporarily free: Fryberg was allowed to leave the court and has 30 to 45 days to report to prison\nThe case revealed flaws in the way federal authorities and tribal governments share information and led to 10 American Indian tribes gaining access to national criminal databases.\nThe tribes, including the Tulalip tribes in Washington, can now conduct thorough background checks and add criminal records to the databases.\nProsecutors say Fryberg lied on a form he filled out when he bought the guns to hide the restraining order. His lawyers said he didn't know he was prohibited from having firearms, and they sought probation as punishment.\nThe sentence was closer to prosecutors' request for 33 months in prison. Fryberg's lawyer, John Henry Browne said after the sentencing hearing that he was pleased the federal judge handed down a term that was nine months shorter than prosecutors requested.\nBut Browne said he will file an appeal on behalf of his client because he doesn't think Fryberg 'needs a day in jail.'\nFryberg was allowed to go free after the hearing and has 30 to 45 days to report to prison.\nSlain: Shaylee Chuculnaskit, left, and Gia Soriano, right - both 14 - were killed by Fryberg\nVictims: Fryberg also gunned down his cousin Andrew, 15, and Zoe Galasso, 14, pictured above together\nThe Washington state dad acquired nine firearms between November 2012 and July 2014, prosecutors say.\nHe bought a Beretta pistol on January 11, 2013, from a gun shop on the reservation, according to a criminal complaint. He answered 'no' on the federal firearms purchasing form when asked if he was the subject of a restraining order that prohibits him from 'harassing, stalking or threatening your child or an intimate partner,' the complaint said.\nBrowne said 'there was never an order prohibiting him from owning or even purchasing firearms' from the tribal court. The issue in court will be whether he lied on the federal purchasing form.\nOn October 14, 2014, Jaylen Fryberg used one of those guns at Marysville Pilchuck High School north of Seattle to kill Zoe Galasso, Gia Soriano and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, all 14, as well as his cousin Andrew Fryberg, 15.\nProsecutors argued that Fryberg lied on a form he filled out when he bought six guns to hide a restraining order against him that should have prevented him from owning firearms\nThe teenage gunman also seriously injured a fifth classmate, 15-year-old Nate Hatch, before turning the gun on himself and ending his life.\nIn an apparent attempt to justify killing his friends and himself, Fryberg told family members in a text message sent right before the massacre: 'I need my crew with me too'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3394262/Dad-Washington-school-shooter-faces-sentencing-guns.html"}
