He comes out and gives us the tools to do a lot of things, and we think he’s going to lead us well.”\nEllington committed to the Panthers in December 2017, playing for Itawamba Community College prior to his commitment to the Panthers.\nBlessed to say that I have COMMITTED to Georgia State University!! #GoPanthers 🔵⚪️⚫️ pic.twitter.com/GbGErsxAiH — Danterius Ellington (@Dan_CH14) December 15, 2017\nDuring the Panthers’ spring game in April, Ellington went 21-for-24 for 249 yards with four touchdown passes.\n“He’s got a really even-keeled demeanor,” Elliott said. “Nothing gets too high, too low for him, and I like that. He exudes confidence when he’s in the huddle. You know, one bad play doesn’t dictate the rest of his game.”\nThe Panthers open the season Thursday, Aug. 30, against Kennesaw State.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/sports/georgia-state-names-dan-ellington-starting-quarterback-for-season-opener/IlgFANr9icT9hZqVzGGHWL/"}
