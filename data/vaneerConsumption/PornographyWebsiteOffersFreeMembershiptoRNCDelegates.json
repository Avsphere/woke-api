We encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children’s safety and well-being. We applaud the social networking sites that bar sex offenders from participation. We urge energetic prosecution of child pornography which closely linked to human trafficking.” The amendment passed with little debate.\nThe relevant section of the 2012 GOP platform reads:\nThe Internet must be made safe for children. We call on service providers to exercise due care to ensure that the Internet cannot become a safe haven for predators while respecting First Amendment rights. We congratulate the social networking sites that bar known sex offenders from participation. We urge active prosecution against child pornography, which is closely linked to the horrors of human trafficking. Current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced.\nKink.com film director Maitresse Madeleine Marlowe wrote an open letter to Republican delegates detailing the offer. The letter reads, in part:\nWe read with dismay that the Republican Party platform committee has endorsed a plank declaring “porn a public health crisis” and a “menace.” While it may not fit with your morals, studies have repeatedly shown that access to adult entertainment is positively correlated with decreases in sex crimes, better performance in bed, and more feminist views of women. (We understand that last one might not be a net positive for you, but we like it.) Next week, you’ll vote to approve or reject that platform, and we want you to have an informed decision. That’s why we’re offering every credentialled Republican delegate free access to our sites from now until November 8.\nMarlowe added a message for #NeverTrump delegates — those committed to opposing Trump as the party’s nominee at all costs — inviting them to watch a Trump-themed pornographic film.\nKink.com has been at the forefront of a political fight against the mandatory use of condoms and protective eyewear in adult films made in California. Both political parties have opposed a November referendum that would impose such a mandate on pornography statewide.\nLos Angeles County voters passed a similar referendum, Measure B, in 2012, prompting a drastic cutback in local permit applications for adult films, as producers relocated production to other states.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2016/07/13/pornography-republican-national-convention-delegates-platform/"}
