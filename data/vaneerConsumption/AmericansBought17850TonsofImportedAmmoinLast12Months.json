Panjiva’s Chris Rogers said, “It’s very unusual in an import industry like this to see such a big move. It tells you that there’s a customer demand that’s not being met by U.S. manufacturers.”\nPanjiva identifies the top foreign importer as “Poongsan Corp.” of South Korea. “Fiocchi Munizioni of Italy and Prvi Partizan of Serbia” are next in line, as far as foreign ammunition importers go.\nBreitbart News previously reported that each of the past 19 consecutive months have been record-breaking months for background checks for firearm sales. The streak began with May 2015–when more background checks were conducted than in any previous May–and continued with more background checks performed in June 2015 than any previous June, more in July 2015 than any previous July, and more in August 2015 than any previous August. Month after month, a record has been broken through November 2016.\nIn fact, the number of background checks performed January 1, 2016 through November 30, 2016, was so high that by the end of November there had already been more background checks performed in 2016 than in any year in history.\nAccording the FBI, there were 24,767,514 background checks performed between January 1 and November 30 of this year.\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.
