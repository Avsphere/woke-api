Really? What were the losses?” Trump touted in a press release statement.\nTrump said, regarding NASCAR canceling one banquet, that he keeps the deposit and can rent it to another organization – collecting two checks instead of one. He added that NASCAR already apologized to Trump.\n“In the case of ESPN, they canceled a simple golf outing at my course, Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles, overlooking the Pacific ocean, perhaps the most valuable parcel of land in all of golf,” Trump stated, adding that he got a large deposit out of that deal as well.\n“I will now let people use the course on that day, receiving substantial additional greens fee income. Again, I get two fees instead of one,” he stated.\nTrump said the headlines surrounding the business deals with ESPN and NASCAR were “blared all over the world” – “Give me a break!” he exclaimed.\nTrump concluded, “All of this because of my strong stance on illegal immigration during my run for President… Make America Great Again!”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/07/trump-to-media-blowout-over-business-deals-give-me-a-break/"}
