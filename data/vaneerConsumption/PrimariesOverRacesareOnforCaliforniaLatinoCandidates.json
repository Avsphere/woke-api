The National Association of Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) tracked the races and assembled an analysis. Here are outcomes of Tuesday''s elections based on unofficial results reported by the California Secretary of State. Unless indicated otherwise, they are based on 100 percent of precincts reporting â€“ but there are still absentee and provisional votes to be counted.\nStatewide Offices\nState Senator Alex Padilla (D) was one of the winners in a crowded race and will face Pete Peterson (R), executive director of Pepperdine University's Davenport Institute for Public Engagement, in the general election contest for California secretary of state.\nFor state controller, the race is extremely close. Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearingen (R) appears to have won the most votes and will run in the general election. In terms of who will oppose her, it is too close to call though unofficial results seem to point to former Assembly Speaker John Perez (D). Two other candidates, accountant David Evans (R) and California State Board of Equalization Member Betty Yee (D) are a few thousand votes behind Perez.\nCongressional Races\nEight incumbent California Latino members of the U.S. House of Representatives will all move forward to run in the general election: Democrats Xavier Becerra, Tony Cardenas, Grace Flores Napolitano, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Raul Ruiz, Linda Sanchez, Loretta Sanchez, and Juan Vargas. In a race being closely watched by both political parties, Ruiz will face State Assembly member Brian Nestande (R) in the general election.\nIn the race for the 35th Congressional District seat currently held by Rep. Gloria Negrete McLeod (D), State Senator Norma J. Torres (D) will face attorney and small business owner Christina Gagnier (D) in the general election.\nIn the 21st Congressional District, former Senate staffer Amanda Renteria won the opportunity to challenge incumbent David Valadao (R) in the general election.\nIn the 22nd Congressional District, disability and victims rights advocate Suzanna Aguilera Marrero (D) won the opportunity to challenge incumbent Devin Nunes (R) in the general election.\nIn the 31st Congressional District, national security consultant Paul Chabot (R) won the chance to go on to the general election. Unofficial results point to a close race between three candidates to compete against Chabot: Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar (D) in the lead (17.4%), followed by business woman Lesli Gooch (R) (16.5%) and attorney Eloise Gomez Reyes (D) (16.0%).\nKey local races\nIn the contest for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 1st District seat held by Supervisor Gloria Molina, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis won a commanding 70% of the vote, and has won the race with no need for a general election run-off.\n--Preliminary results/analysis provided by NALEO","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/primaries-over-races-are-california-latino-candidates-n122731"}
