In “The Apprentice: Trump, Russia and The Subversion of American Democracy,” The Post’s two-time Pulitzer-Prize winning National Security Correspondent Greg Miller, along with contributions from fellow Post reporters, provides readers with a comprehensive account of the pre- and post-election story stretching from the Kremlin to the West Wing.\n“Greg Miller, along with his colleagues on our national security and political teams, has been at the forefront of coverage of Russia’s intervention in the 2016 presidential campaign. A highly accomplished investigative reporter and a magnificent writer, Greg digs deep into what produced this stunning turn in American presidential history,” said Martin Baron, Executive Editor of The Washington Post. “The events of the past several years called for a revelatory and riveting book, and Greg delivered.”\nThe book draws on reporting over the last two years by the National, Foreign, Business and Local staffs and is illustrated, in part, with photos by Washington Post staff photographers. A number of reporters also did additional reporting for The Apprentice, notably Devlin Barrett, Karen DeYoung, Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tom Hamburger, Rosalind Helderman, Sari Horwitz, Greg Jaffe, Ellen Nakashima, Julie Tate, Craig Timberg, Anton Troivanovksi and Matt Zapotosky.\nThe Apprentice will be published by Custom House, a division of HarperCollins Publishers, and is scheduled for release on October 2, 2018.\n“Greg Miller and the team at The Washington Post have been working on The Apprentice since April 2017, and it shows–no other book has covered the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with greater scope and determination to get to the truth.” said Custom House Editorial Director Geoff Shandler in a press release.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2018/08/05/the-washington-post-to-release-new-book-examining-russian-interference-in-the-2016-election-and-its-impact-beyond/"}
