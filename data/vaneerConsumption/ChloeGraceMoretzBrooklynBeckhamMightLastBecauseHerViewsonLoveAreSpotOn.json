Granted, a 24-year-old woman’s idol probably shouldn’t be an 11-year-old fictional crime-fighting superheroine, but then you can’t really get any better than the adorable Mindy Macready. For one, she rocked the purple-haired trend way before any of us even considered dipping a strand of hair into dye, and for another, well, no one would cross her in a fight to the death. More importantly, she does have some wise words for any of us entering our first relationships — or at least Hit-Girl’s real life counterpart Chloë Grace Moretz does. The 17-year-old If I Stay Actress is in her first celebrity affair herself with soccer royalty Brooklyn Beckham, so she’s experiencing a lot of the firsts too. Moretz and Beckham met in SoulCycle and adorably go on chaperoned dates (because neither of them drive), and they were also spotted together at Sunday's Teen Choice Awards.\nWhile they might be Hollywood's \"It\" young couple of the moment, Moretz has a grounded view for any starlet going into a relationship, and it just adds to her new film If I Stay, where a girl has an out-of-body experience and watches as her family and her boyfriend visit her in the hospital. The film's rife with young love and the deep, world ending feels that come with it — or so it always feel like in high school.\nSo here are a few nuggets of love wisdom from Moretz perfect for any young pair of paramours:\nYou're Young, You're Going to Change\nIn an interview with Flare magazine, Moretz pointed out that while you might think Aaron Samuels in math class is your end-all be all, he isn't. She told the mag, “It’s a tough age to fall in love: people change so quickly. I don’t want to have to feel like I have to watch my step, ‘cause I’m 17 and I shouldn’t have to.”\nYour True Love Is Your Life's Passion\nMoretz's character in If I Stay has a passion for music and Moretz saw her own passion for acting in that. She told E! that that should be what comes before any sort of relationship feels. “We wouldn’t give up on our one true love,” Moretz said. “No matter how much we love a guy or how much we love whoever else, we care most about what we found first and what our one true love was first.”\nLife Isn't Just About Relationships\nWhile romance and boyfriend and girlfriends might be on the mind thanks to those hormones, Moretz had a clear head about time liens. She told Flare, \"I'm like, Dude, you're wasting away your entire high-school years, and now you're going to waste away your college years. You're going to spend your entire life in a relationship and then you're going to get married...and then you're dead!\"\nOkay, that might have escalated toward morbidity, but Moretz does have a point that there's more to experience than relationships. Not that relationships are bad or anything, of course, but she has a good perspective on love and life. It's just another reason why I want to be Hit-Girl when I grow up.\nImages: Child-Actor-Gifs, DanysAlternate/Tumblr; Giphy","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35583-chloe-grace-moretz-brooklyn-beckham-might-last-because-her-views-on-love-are-spot-on"}
