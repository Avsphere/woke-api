Senior Malik Benlevi added 16 points and senior Jeff Thomas scored 15.\nTemperatures in the non-air conditioned gym rose above 90 degrees.\n‚ÄúWe played a lot of guys and used those tough conditions to hopefully make us better long term,‚Äù head coach Ron Hunter said in a statement. ‚ÄúI thought our seniors played well which is exactly what I want to see out of them.‚Äù\nAfter allowing Mataro All Stars to race to a 22-22 tie in the first quarter, Georgia State rallied to a 54-47 halftime lead. Georgia State maintained a 26-point lead through the final two quarters.\nThe Mataro All Stars finished with four players in double figures.\nThe third game in the nine-day, three-game trip through Spain has been called off as Europe‚Äôs oppressive heatwave will make gym conditions Monday night in Barcelona intolerable.\nGeorgia State fell to the Madrid All-Stars, 82-77, Friday night.\nGeorgia State players will make multiple tours and excursions before flying back to Atlanta Wednesday.\nDuring the trip, Hunter and Georgia State players took part in shoe distributions with Samaritan‚Äôs Feet.\nCheck out some of the images from our @Samaritans_Feet shoe distribution this morning in Barcelona, Spain, as well as our tour of Sagrada Familia. üèÄüá™https://t.co/EscVL2LFAl pic.twitter.com/OGZYGZh2Z4 ‚Äî GSU Men's Basketball (@GeorgiaStateMBB) August 5, 2018\nHunter has become one of the faces of the organization.
