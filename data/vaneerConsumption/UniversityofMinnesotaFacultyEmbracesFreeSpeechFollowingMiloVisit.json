Ironically, the image was used to promote a panel discussion on free speech and censorship after the terrorist massacre of the magazine’s writers and editors.\nThis is the second time members of a university faculty or administration have acted in favour of free speech following a Yiannopoulos visit to campus. Following the Breitbart Tech editor’s visit to Rutgers, the president of that university released a statement firmly backing free speech and the right to air offensive views.\nYiannopoulos tour of US campuses has been marked by hysterical protests by students. At the University of Minnesota, they blasted air horns at Yiannopoulos and Sommers, while at Rutgers they smeared red paint on their faces, the walls, and the floors while chanting “Black Lives Matter.”\nOffended students typically retreat to “safe spaces” and therapy sessions after visits by Yiannopoulos. This has happened on no less than three occasions: at the universities of Rutgers, Pittsburgh and Michigan. The decision of the University of Minnesota’s faculty is another sign that administrators and professors are souring on student crybully activism.\nThe text of the University of Minnesota faculty’s statement in support of free speech on campus can be read in full at The Washington Post.\nYou can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, add him on Facebook, and download Milo Alert! for Android to be kept up to date on his latest articles.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/12/university-of-minnesota-faculty-embraces-free-speech-following-milo-visit/"}
