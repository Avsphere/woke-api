The total number of border crossing children who were separated from the adults they arrived with at the border by the Obama administration is unknown, as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not track those records at the time.\n\"A series of rare photos taken from inside detention facilities where mostly Central American minors were held in detention by Obama in 2014 reveals that detention of border crossers has largely remained the same under Trump as it was previously.\" https://t.co/kxYbm330b5 ‚Äî John Binder üëΩ (@JxhnBinder) June 18, 2018\nAbout 1,400 American children are separated from their incarcerated parents for every one child border crosser who is separated from the illegal alien adult with whom they arrived at the border, Breitbart News reported.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/06/21/court-records-feds-have-separated-illegal-alien-families-since-before-2001/"}
