Like the first person who died of the flu this season, on Oct. 16, the person who died most recently was between the ages of 45 and 64, lived in the southwest part of the state and had not been vaccinated against the flu this season, she said.\nLast year, the first flu death of the season wasn't reported until late November, she said. A total of 227 people died of the flu that season, making it the deadliest in decades.\nLast month, state health officials said they were seeing an unusual uptick in cases. But Mirivel said the level of activity as of Monday was lower than at the same time last year.\nMetro on 10/30/2018","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/oct/30/second-flu-death-of-season-reported-201-1/"}
