B - Safety not assured: aircraft proximity in which the safety of the aircraft may have been compromised. C - No risk of collision: aircraft proximity in which no risk of collision has existed. D - Risk not determined: aircraft proximity in which insufficient information was available to determine the risk involved, or inconclusive or conflicting evidence precluded such determination. E - Met the criteria for reporting but, by analysis, it was determined that normal procedures, safety standards and parameters pertained. Source: UK Airprox Board\nSteve Landells, flight safety specialist at the British Airline Pilots Association, said: 'We must now act to protect passengers and flight crew and make sure a catastrophic crash does not happen.'\nIn one recent case a 'quadcopter' drone narrowly missed hitting the wing of a Boeing 777 shortly after it took off from Heathrow Airport.\nThe incident on September 22 happened at 2,000 feet, which is double the legal altitude for drones transmitting live video to their operators.\nThe jet pilot said the drone narrowly passed down the right hand side of their airliner and there was no time to take action.\nIt was concluded by the UKAB that the drone was at the same height and within 25 metres of the jet, meaning 'chance had played a major part' in there being no collision.\nAlthough a report was made to the police, the drone operator was not traced.\nClose: The graphic shows the flight path of the Boeing 777 which avoided the drone at 2,000ft above Heathrow\nA Boeing 777, similar to this, came within 25 metres of a drone that was double its legal altitude (file photo)\nMr Landells, a former pilot, called for the introduction of new regulations 'without delay'.\nHe said: 'Pilots want to ensure technology to prevent drones from flying in areas of dense air traffic is put in place and also want drone designers to liaise with air traffic controllers to look at ways they can adapt drones to ensure they can be seen easily on radars.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423315/Crack-drones-catastrophe-Pilot-calls-action-FOUR-near-misses-British-airports.html"}
