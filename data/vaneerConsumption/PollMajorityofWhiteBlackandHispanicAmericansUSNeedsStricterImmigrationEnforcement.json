House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE.\nAbolishing ICE, as Breitbart News reported, would have allowed more than 1.6 million illegal aliens to have gone free throughout the U.S. in the last five years. Nearly 60 percent of Democrat voters say they do not want ICE abolished, while about 3-in-4 swing voters say the same.\n\"Nearly 60 percent of Democrats said they do not want ICE to be disbanded.

Tom Cotton (R-AR), at the time, called the Senate Democrats‚Äô plan ‚Äúthe Child Trafficking Encouragement Act,‚Äù saying it would lead to children being ‚Äúabducted & sold to drug cartels & slave-traders as a free ticket into U.S.‚Äù\nLikewise, thirteen Republican Senators also demanded that President Trump end all border and immigration enforcement until Congress passed legislation that would ban illegal alien adults arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border from being separated from the children they crossed into the country with.\nBreitbart News compiled a list of those Republican Senators.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/07/04/poll-majority-of-white-black-and-hispanic-americans-u-s-needs-stricter-immigration-enforcement/"}
