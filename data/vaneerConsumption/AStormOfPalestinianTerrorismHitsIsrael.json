The terrorist was shot dead after a nearby soldier pursued the criminal as he was trying to escape. Paramedics said that four were hurt in the terror attack, and a fifth person checked themselves into the hospital. Luckily, none of the victims suffered critical injuries.\nAn emergency medical volunteer said as he arrived on scene: “I came upon two women who were fully conscious with stab wounds to their upper bodies. We assisted individuals at the scene who were suffering from shock.”\nIsraelis continue to carry on with their daily lives, remaining defiant in the face of this ongoing wave of terror despite attacks showing no signs of stopping anytime soon.\nAs the Tel Aviv attack was being committed, IDF troops were on a manhunt for a Palestinian suspect who on Thursday was suspected of stabbing a civilian in the Jewish community of Kiryat Arba, which is near Hebron and located in the disputed territories.\n“Initial reports indicate a Palestinian assailant stabbed a civilian near Kiryat Arba. The attacker fled the scene. Forces are searching the area. The civilian was severely wounded and is now being evacuated for emergency medical care,” an IDF statement on the matter read.\nAt around noon in Israel’s capital city of Jerusalem, an unprovoked Palestinian terrorist stabbed an Israeli man in the middle of the street, causing severe injuries.\nThursday’s terrorist attacks follow a string of earlier Palestinian assaults which have left dozens of Israelis dead or injured.\nOn Wednesday, a Palestinian woman stabbed two Israelis in Jerusalem. Around the same time, Palestinian rioters stoned a Jewish woman in an area outside of the capital.\nOver the weekend, four Israelis were killed and an infant was stabbed by a Palestinian in Jerusalem.\nThere remains multiple investigations into other incidents that have happened throughout the country which may eventually be declared as acts of terrorism.\nIsrael’s defense apparatus has kicked into full-gear, taking all possible precautions to prevent further attacks. Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben Dahan has recommended that Israelis who are licensed to carry firearms should do so. Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barakat has recommended the same deterrence and defense strategy.\nAmid the continuing surge of attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for an emergency meeting of his top defense officials. Netanyahu has been under pressure to take aggressive measures against the rioters and terrorists, but he has taken a more cautious approach thus far.\nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, a supposed “moderate,” has continued to fan the flames for terror. He has yet to condemn any of the countless terror attacks committed by Palestinians against innocent Jews (at least eight documented attacks since Wednesday). Instead, Abbas said Thursday that he stands with the people “protecting Al-Aqsa mosque.” Abbas has claimed, falsely, over the past few weeks, that Israel is “desecrating” the mosque, stirring up radical ideals among the Islamic zealots in Palestinian lands.\n“Each drop of blood that was spilled in Jerusalem is pure blood as long as it’s for the sake of Allah. Every martyr will be in heaven and every wounded person will be rewarded by Allah’s will,” the “moderate” Abbas said in September, in calling for the defense of the mosque from Jews who wish to pray on the grounds.\nAbbas reiterated the aforementioned remarks Thursday, saying the Palestinians’ “hands are with those who are protecting Al-Aqsa mosque.”\nThe Obama administration has remained notably silent in the face of a full-blown terror campaign against one of America’s most loyal allies. The State Department refused to condemn the Palestinian terrorists or their leadership for committing dozens of heinous acts this week, and has instead called “on all sides to take affirmative steps to restore calm and avoid escalating the situation.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/10/08/storm-palestinian-terrorism-hits-israel/"}
