Four more test blasts have followed, two of them last year.\nIt has continued to defy the international community, even after two rounds of UN-backed international sanctions, and last week test fired a salvo of ballistic missiles that fell in waters off Japan.\n\"In the face of the ever-escalating threat it is clear that a new approach is required,\" Tillerson said, offering no details.\nBut he reiterated Washington's vow to face down the North Korean threat and back regional friends Japan and South Korea.\nTillerson and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida (second from the right) held talks at the Iikura Guesthouse in Tokyo\n\"The US commitment to the defence of Japan and its other treaty allies through the full range of our military capabilities is unwavering,\" he promised.\nUS President Donald Trump stirred concern in the region during his White House campaign by suggesting allies like Japan and South Korea need to do more to defend themselves.\nBut since his victory he has twice met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and has been careful to offer complete support, as Tillerson reiterated.\nKishida and Abe thanked the former oil man for the US backing, and the Japanese prime minister fondly remembered a golf round last month with Trump.\n- 'Bring it out' -\nAfter Tokyo, Tillerson flies to Seoul for talks with South Korea's acting leader and at the weekend heads to Beijing to finalise plans for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to visit Trump in April.\nUS officials have been spooked by North Korea's accelerating progress towards building an intercontinental ballistic missile that could threaten US mainland cities.\nChina is perhaps the last country with significant leverage over Kim Jong-Un's isolated regime.\n\"We do believe they have a very important role to play,\" Tillerson said of Beijing. \"We will be having discussions with China as to other actions that they should be undertaking.\"\nBeijing shares US concerns over Pyongyang's attempts to build an arsenal of nuclear devices, but has also blamed Washington for escalating tensions.\nIt called last week for North Korea to suspend its nuclear and missile activities in exchange for the US and South Korea halting military exercises to avert a dangerous confrontation -- the latter rejected by the US.\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing Thursday that Beijing stood by the idea.\n\"If the US or another country has a better plan, a better proposal, they can bring it out,\" she said.\nIn the absence of specific details on how to increase pressure on Pyongyang from either Tillerson or Kishida, observers see several options.\nThey include a pre-emptive strike against missile and nuclear facilities, dialogue the US has currently made conditional on tangible commitment by Pyongyang to stop the programmes, and stepped-up sanctions, according to James Kim from the Seoul-based Asan Institute of Policy Studies.\n\"The US Congress has shown great interest in tougher sanctions,\" Kim said. \"That means the US could implement stronger sanctions which could be, in my view, similar to those previously imposed on Iran.\"\nIran came to an agreement with world powers to rein in its nuclear program after US secondary sanctions punished European banks that were dealing with the Tehran regime.\nSome Washington policy experts have called for similar measures to deal with Chinese banks working with North Korea, but others hope Beijing will come on board without a clash.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4319240/Two-decades-efforts-disarm-NKorea-failed-Tillerson.html"}
