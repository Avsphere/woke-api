'\nDr Marques added very hot water should be avoided.\nDr Marques advises people clean between their teeth daily and even rinse with coconut oil\nHe said: 'Very hot water can damage the bristles of your toothbrush in the long term, as well as the added risk of burning your mouth.'\nTo keep your smile stunning, Dr Marques has shared his top tips for caring for your teeth:\nDRINKS ARE DESTROYING CHILDREN'S TEETH Two in three drinks consumed by primary school children are bad for their teeth. Water accounts for only a quarter of liquids drunk by five to nine-year-olds, while plain milk makes up only 10 per cent. ‘Diet’ fizzy drinks make up 30 per cent of overall consumption. The Natural Hydration Council commissioned the survey. Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive, the Oral Health Foundation, said: ‘It’s important that people know that diet drinks can still be damaging to your teeth. ‘Some of the ingredients in many of them, such as phosphoric acid, citric acid and tartaric acid, can be damaging and lead to dental erosion.'\n1. Use an electric toothbrush\nElectric toothbrushes are the most effective way of cleaning your teeth and stop you brushing too hard.\n2. Brush twice a day\nBrush every morning and just before bed for at least two minutes. Stop after three minutes to prevent wearing the teeth away.\n3. Clean between the teeth\nUse interdental brushes or floss at least once a day to prevent a build-up of plaque between the teeth.\n4. Use a manual brush right\nElectric is best, but if you use an manual brush, angle it a 45-degree angle towards the gum and use small circular motions that cover all exposed areas.\n5. Apply the right pressure\nBrushing too rigorously can wear down the enamel, but too gently will fail to remove plaque.\n6. Brush through bleeding gums\nBleeding gums may be off-putting, but they will eventually become less inflamed and healthier.\n7. Swish around a mouthwash\nUse a nonalcoholic fluoride-containing mouthwash after every brush. Avoid rinsing with water as this washes toothpaste away.\n8. Rinse with coconut oil\nThis helps to remove plaque and bacteria from between the teeth.\n9. Be careful with whitening toothpastes\nOpt for natural ingredients such as calcium carbonate and silica.\n10. Get friendly with your dentist\nHave a check-up every six months to remove the damage you cannot undo yourself.\nThis comes after scientists from the University of Illinois found sucking on five sugar-free mints a day could repair damage to teeth.\nAs well as refreshing the breath, the mints may protect teeth between brushes.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4447150/A-celebrity-dentist-gives-teeth-brushing-tips.html"}
