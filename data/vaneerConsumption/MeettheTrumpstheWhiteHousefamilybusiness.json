Both sons are happy to engage with the media.\nFather of five Don Jr., 39, is thought to harbor political ambitions of his own. Eric, 33, has given a slew of interviews, suggesting that Ivanka influenced the missile strikes on Syria, calling nepotism a \"factor of life\" and standing by his father's predilection for golf.\nFirst lady who?\nMelania, a 47-year-old former model from Slovenia and Trump's third wife, is the first foreign-born first lady in two centuries.\nKnown for a fondness for European designer clothes, nude photo shoots in the past and taking a back seat, Melania lives in New York with 11-year-old son Barron and makes only fleeting public appearances.\nOfficially moving into the White House this summer at the end of the school year, she is considered a reluctant first lady who has been criticized for plagiarizing Michelle Obama and for her heavy accent.\nMore than half a million people signed a petition demanding she move straight to Washington or foot herself the bill for the $127,000-$146,000 a day security costs of staying behind in New York.\nShe settled a lawsuit with the Daily Mail that alleged she worked as an escort in the 1990s. She was most recently in the headlines for nudging her husband into raising his arm for the national anthem at the Easter egg roll.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4446610/Meet-Trumps-White-House-family-business.html"}
