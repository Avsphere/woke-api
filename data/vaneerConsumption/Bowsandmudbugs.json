This was at the 12th Ragin' Cajun crawfish boil for CARTI. Folks cooed, \"Oh, look, a rainbow!\" then dug into their trousers or handbags for evidence-gathering devices.\nThat rad rainbow was bad mojo. It charged the radiation therapy-supportive crowd. The color drained from the sky. The rains came.\nIt wasn't so bad.\nCARTI is no longer an acronym for Central Arkansas Radiation Therapy Institute, you know. But the nonprofit cancer center still provides medical and surgical oncology, diagnostic radiology and radiation oncology at locations all around the state, from El Dorado to Mountain Home.\nRagin' Cajun broke its previous records for attendance and money raised -- about 1,700 and $132,000, respectively.\nThe meat of more than 6,300 pounds of crawfish and about 24 kegs of beer were carried out of the stadium in temperature-controlled human storage containers.\nEvent chairman was again Lorene Jones-Henderson. Louisiana-based Iberia Bank -- fittingly -- was the presenting sponsor, and the band was Drummerboy Infinity.\n-- Story and photos by\nBobby Ampezzan\nHigh Profile on 04/24/2016","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/apr/24/bows-and-mudbugs-20160424/"}
