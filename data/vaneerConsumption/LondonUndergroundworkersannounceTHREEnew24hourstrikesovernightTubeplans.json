Its station staff will also take a week of industrial action from February 7 in a separate dispute over jobs and rosters.\nDisruption: London Underground is facing a series of crippling strikes after two unions announced that their members were to stage three 24-hour walkouts. A separate week of industrial action is also planned\nRMT General Secretary Mick Cash said his union members were ‘furious’ at the ‘bodged’ introduction of the proposed Night Tube, but London mayor Boris Johnson hit back.\nHe backed Tube bosses to take on the unions, who he accused of 'an advance attack of Corbynitis'.\nMr Johnson also said it was 'unbelievable' Aslef had ordered three 24-hour strikes and added that London Underground (LU) had to resist the 'unreasonable' demands.\nHe said: 'The decision to strike has been orchestrated by union barons without ever properly consulting their members. It is an absolute disgrace.\n'Today's decision to strike makes it abundantly clear that the union leadership is hell bent on preventing not just their own members from doing these jobs but anyone else from working the night Tube as well.\n'These strikes are absurd. They will hit the travelling public, business and hard-working Tube staff, many of whom clearly don't believe in this nonsense. Ultimately it will do nothing to prevent the advent of the night Tube.'\nLU has offered a four-year pay deal and said it will hire part-time drivers to staff an all-night service at weekends.\nThe RMT said workers will strike for 24 hours from 6.30pm on January 26, February 15 and February 17 in the long running row over pay and the proposed night Tube. There was similar industrial action in August (pictured)\nBut unions have been seeking assurances for months about terms and conditions for their members, with leaders attacking LU for 'tying' the pay deal to the night Tube.\nUnion bosses also say that their members have been out of pocket since last year.\nRMT members will strike from 6.30pm on January 26, February 15 and February 17, while the drivers' union Aslef plan to do so from 9.15pm on the same dates.\nRMT general secretary Mick Cash said: 'RMT members are furious at the bodged introduction of the Mayor's night Tube plans and the fact that they have been tied in with a pay deal that has left our members dangling on a string and out of pocket since April last year.\n'RMT supports the principle of a properly worked out night Tube service introduced through agreement with the unions but the abject failure to work through the detail has led to a comprehensive breakdown in the negotiations and has forced us to name a programme of further industrial action.\n'This whole situation could have been avoided if London Underground, under direction from the Mayor, had dealt with the night Tube professionally from the off instead of resorting to ultimatums and imposition.\nLONDON UNDERGROUND STRIKES The Rail, Maritime and Transport union: London Underground station staff will walk out for 24 hours from 6.30pm on: January 26\nFebruary 15\nFebruary 17 RMT station staff will also take a week of industrial action from February 7 in a separate dispute over jobs and rosters. The Aslef union: Tube drivers will walk out for 24 hours from 9.15pm on: January 26\nFebruary 15\nFebruary 17 Unite union: Electrical and maintenance technicians, linesmen and signallers on the Tube network will strike for 24 hours from 6.30pm on: January 26\nFebruary 15\nFebruary 17\n'RMT has fought for more jobs on the Underground to cope with the added pressures of night Tube but those jobs must be within the framework of the existing Tube operations and must offer career opportunities to the Underground's existing staff, including existing drivers who may choose to take up the offer of reducing their hours.'\nMr Cash added it was 'crazy' to be imposing new rosters linked to the axing of over 800 jobs through the closure of ticket offices.\n'The station staff are the eyes and ears of the Underground and hacking back their numbers represents a lethal gamble with safety that RMT will continue to fight against,' he said.\nThe industrial action is likely to spell further travel misery for commuters across the capital after previous strikes last year.\nRail unions staged two 24-hour strikes in July and August 2015 and had threatened longer walkouts last September, although these were suspended at the last moment.\nTransport for London (TfL) was due to launch the nightly service on September 12 but postponed it until a later date in the autumn. It was then delayed again to the new year but no new launch date has been given.\nDrivers' union Aslef said the latest walkouts will lead to a complete shutdown of the Underground, adding that further dates for action will be announced.\nThe union's London district organiser, Finn Brennan, said: 'We genuinely regret the inconvenience that will be caused but the behaviour of London Underground's senior management team have left us with no other choice.\n'Our negotiating team last met London Underground at Acas on November 10 and since then they have refused to talk to us despite repeated requests. Our members have been extremely patient, they have waited for more than three and half years for promised talks on improving work life balance.\n'There is still no indication when they will receive the pay rise that was due last April.\n'When an employer is simply not prepared to talk, then our only option is to take industrial action.\n'We want to see an all-night service introduced, and we are not opposed to the recruitment of part time staff. But we will not accept a zero hours culture being introduced and working conditions undermined. Aslef wants a fair deal for existing staff and for new employees.\n'We are ready to talk at any time to finally resolve this dispute. It is time for the mayor of London and his team at TfL to stop the political posturing and engage with us to stop London suffering more disruption.'\nThe industrial action is likely to spell further travel misery for commuters across the capital after previous strikes last year (pictured). Further industrial action set for September was avoided at the last moment\nUnite, which represents 600 engineers and maintenance workers on LU, said its members will also strike for 24 hours from 6.30pm on January 26, February 15 and 17.\nNational officer Hugh Roberts said the sticking points were an 'inadequate' four-year pay offer and a failure to reach an agreement over the night Tube.\nHe added: 'LU bosses are also threatening to impose rosters and tear up agreements.\nWHERE THE TUBE TALKS STAND London Underground (LU) has offered a four-year pay deal, which it says includes above-inflation pay rises. It also said it will hire part-time drivers to staff an all-night service at weekends, while claiming it has created 700 more Tube jobs and was ensuring the protection of the work-life balance of existing staff. But unions have been seeking assurances for months about terms and conditions for their members. RMT also said its members had been out of pocket since April last year, and accused LU of being 'crazy' to impose new rosters linked to the axing of over 800 jobs through the closure of ticket offices. Drivers' union Aslef said its members 'refused to accept a zero hours culture being introduced and working conditions undermined'. Its leaders also said there was still no indication when members would receive the pay rise that they say was due last April. Unite says its sticking points to an agreement are an 'inadequate' four-year pay offer, concern over members' work/life balance with the proposed night Tube and the prospect of zero hours contracts associated with it.\n'Unite is not against the principle of the night Tube as we can see the benefits for the nocturnal economy of one of the world's great and diverse cities.\n'However, it should not be at the expense of our members' work/life balance - they have families too - and they should be suitably rewarded for this work.\n'LU management can't expect the night Tube to be run on the cheap with the prospect of zero hours contracts for drivers during this period.'\nIn response to the announcement of further strikes by the unions, Steve Griffiths, chief operating officer for London Underground, said: 'The unions' position is absurd and detached from the real world.\n'Apparently, above-inflation pay rises, the creation of 700 more Tube jobs and the total protection of the work-life balance of existing staff are grounds for strikes.\n'The truth is that they expect our customers to pay for their excessive demands for even more money, fewer hours and a four day week. No employer could allow this and strike action will change nothing. There is no more money.\n'Our four-year pay offer is extremely fair and we have gone the extra mile to fully protect the work-life balance of all our staff.\n'We will have hired around 700 additional staff, which gives total protection of work-life balance. This is precisely what the unions have asked for, making their call for strikes even more astonishing.\n'The unions also attempt to justify their position on a lack of engagement with them. This too is nonsense. We have held numerous meetings with the unions since October 2014, including with the conciliation service ACAS.'\n'London needs a night Tube service and we have made all of the running to implement it fairly. The only thing standing in the way is union intransigence.'\nThe unions' position is absurd and detached from the real world London Underground's Steve Griffiths\nLondon Chamber of Commerce chief executive Colin Stanbridge said: 'The news of further strikes on the Underground is a blow to Londoners and bad for business.\n'The Tube network is critical economic infrastructure and more needs to be done to minimise the potential for future strike action. London as a thriving world capital cannot afford to be continually brought to a standstill.\n'During the last series of strikes firms in the service industry reported significant loss of trade, particularly large corporate bookings at hotels and event spaces cancelled.'\nJames Sproule, of the Institute of Directors, said: 'Business leaders and ordinary workers in London will be shaking their heads in disbelief that they are facing yet more public transport chaos.\n'Instead of getting on with putting their business plans for 2016 into action, our members now have to worry about how their staff are going to get into work on the three days of industrial action.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3394059/London-Underground-workers-announce-THREE-new-24-hour-strikes-week-industrial-action-night-Tube-plans-pay.html"}
