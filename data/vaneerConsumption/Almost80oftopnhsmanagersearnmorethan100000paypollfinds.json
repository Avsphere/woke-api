It simply doesn't add up.\n\"The Government needs to set up independent review of the remuneration of NHS senior managers. There also has to be an end to the two-tier approach to fixing pay for managers and staff.\"\nUnite union national officer for health Barrie Brown said: \"What we have here is the Alice in Wonderland world of NHS pay when many NHS top bosses - who do not treat patients - are taking home much more than the Prime Minister's salary of £142,500, while nurses and other health professionals on £22,000 a year have seen their real incomes eroded by 15% since 2010.\n\"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is keen to impose contract changes on the junior doctors, but seems strangely averse to tackling the mega pay packets of NHS chief executives.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3422855/Almost-80-NHS-managers-earn-100-000-pay-poll-finds.html"}
