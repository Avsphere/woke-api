North Korea does this periodically, they move things back and forth... There's nothing to indicate it's ballistic-missile related.\"\nCiting an anonymous government source, Kyodo News in Japan said the satellite imagery had been collected over the past several days.\nThe United States regularly monitors North Korea from space, while Japan began its own satellite monitoring of the country in 2003.\nNorth Korea is banned under UN Security Council resolutions from carrying out any launch using ballistic missile technology, although repeated small-range missile tests have gone unpunished.\nThe development parallels events in December 2012, when Pyongyang put a satellite into orbit with its Unha-3 carrier.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3421193/N-Korea-apparently-preparing-kind-launch-US-official.html"}
