He then stops in the middle of the road for a minute with his hazards on\nThe driver then goes off and is out of sight until he can be seen turning around in the middle of the road, and driving back towards Mr Steward\nThe driver decides to stop in the middle of the road during rush hour, and stay still with his hazards on for about a minute, before moving off.\nThe driver goes out of sight of the Steward family, before they see him perform a U-turn in the middle of the road, and drive towards them.\nMr Steward slows his car to a stop as the Ford approaches them, and rams into his car once from the front before clipping it from the side and driving off.\nAt the time, Mr Steward was in the car with his nine-year-old daughter who was sitting in the front seat, where the Ford driver could clearly see, and his 13 year old son in the back seat.\nMr Steward said: 'Frankly this was a terrifying ordeal from the start - I'm not sure exactly what was wrong with the driver or why they tried to ram us but it's scary to think motorists like this are out there on UK roads.\n'We were all hugely nervous that the car would return and he would do something else that could harm us. Both my kids have been left totally traumatised by the whole thing, as have I, and have now become really nervous whenever we have to go on a car journey.'\nThe father-of-two slows his car when he sees the Ford driver approaching and said he and his children were 'hugely nervous' throughout the ordeal\nIn a shocking turn, the Ford driver then rams his car into the front of theirs, despite being able to see there were children inside\nHe then reverses and pulls away, appearing to clip the side of the car as he drives off in the opposite direction\nMr Steward handed the footage to the police. Following a review of the case by the Traffic Justice Department, they decided to send the case to the Crown Prosecution Service to seek prosecution for dangerous driving. After initially throwing out the case, an appeal was made and a further review of the incident is currently in progress.\nRichard Browning, director at Nextbase, the UK's largest manufacturer of Dash Cams commented: 'Unfortunately road rage incidents are common in the UK, but this has to be one of the most extreme cases we've seen. Obviously it's never acceptable to ram another vehicle, but what makes this case so shocking is the fact that the driver of the Ford could clearly see children were present in the other car.\n'Thankfully Jonathan had a dash cam installed and was able to share this footage with his insurer and the police. Hopefully the Crown Prosecution Service will take action and this driver will be punished appropriately.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319152/Shocking-moment-angry-driver-performs-U-turn-RAMS-car.html"}
