(AP) - Atlantic City police have confiscated 62 toy guns from a store on the Boardwalk.\nPolice say the toys on sale at Bags and Accessories appeared real, with the exception of orange tips at the end of the barrels. But, police say the tips are easily removed and that could lead people to perceive that the toys are real weapons.\nIn 2014, the city adopted an ordinance that prohibits the sale of imitation firearms.\nThe store's owner was issued a summons for violating the ordinance.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4447518/Atlantic-City-police-confiscate-60-toy-guns.html"}
