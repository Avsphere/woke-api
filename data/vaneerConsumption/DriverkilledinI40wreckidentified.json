Smith, 53, of Dallas died when a Peterbilt tractor-trailer failed to stop for slowing traffic near the Galloway Road exit and hit the rear of his 2012 Cadillac CTS. The impact sent the Cadillac into a Freightliner tractor-trailer ahead of it.\nThe Peterbilt truck then also hit the Freightliner, and the Freightliner then hit a Volvo van, police said.\nThe crash happened about 5 p.m., snarling traffic in the area for hours. Smith was pronounced dead at the scene about 6:20 p.m.\nThe drivers of the Peterbilt and Freightliner trucks were taken to Baptist Health Medical Center for treatment of unspecified injuries, authorities said.\nThe death and three others Wednesday raised to 217 the number of people killed in vehicle crashes in Arkansas so far this year, according to preliminary figures.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/jul/10/driver-killed-i-40-wreck-identified/"}
