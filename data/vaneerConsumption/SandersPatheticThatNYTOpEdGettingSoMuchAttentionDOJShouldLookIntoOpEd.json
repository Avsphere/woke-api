But someone actively trying to undermine the duly elected president and the entire executive branch of government, that seems quite problematic to me, and something that they should take a look at.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/09/10/sanders-pathetic-that-nyt-op-ed-getting-so-much-attention-doj-should-look-into-op-ed/"}
