The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nOur cars are getting smarter and smarter, so why not our bikes? With a special carbon-fiber body and built-in wireless and sonar, the Vanhawk Valour is perhaps the world's most high-tech bicycle. It even has a companion app. But you won't find it in stores â€” yet.\nThe Valour is packed full of electronics, and communicates wirelessly with your smartphone to give you directions (indicated by lights on the handlebars) as well as track distance and calories burned. It also senses things like bad roads, guiding you around those next time. Wouldn't want all that tech to shake loose.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/gift-guide/carbon-fiber-sonar-wireless-smartest-bike-ever-made-n96101"}
