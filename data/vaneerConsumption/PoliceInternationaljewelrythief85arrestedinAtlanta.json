According to Pickard's research, Payne's criminal history, the basis of the 2013 documentary “The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,” began when she was in her 20s.\nIn addition to her most recent arrest in Atlanta, Payne is wanted in North Carolina, where she allegedly stole a $32,000 David Yurman engagement ring in July from a Charlotte-area mall, WSOC-TV reported.\n—Please return to AJC.com for updates.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/news/police-international-jewelry-thief-arrested-atlanta/jXDK7cno6jrPMoB0qfLwVL/"}
