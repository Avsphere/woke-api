The movies - all shot in Atlanta - alone collectively have grossed more than a half billion dollars.\n“I just don’t want to be her age playing her,” said Perry, who is 49. Madea is perpetually in her late 60s stretching back two decades.\nHe said there will be one last play tour and one final film - appropriately titled “Madea’s Funeral,” which wrapped two years ago and is sitting in the can.\nPerry is currently promoting his latest comedic film “Nobody’s Fool,” out November 2 starring Tiffany Haddish, Decatur native Omari Hardwick, Tika Sumpter, Mehcad Brooks, Amber Riley and Whoopi Goldberg. It was shot at Tyler Perry Studios this past spring.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/radiotvtalk/tyler-perry-says-the-madea-franchise-ending-forever-2019/7CTgs3dAFdKR03Avus5E0M/"}
