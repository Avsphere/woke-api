Police say he then informed them about the burning building.\nAfter killing Jaden and then hiding in a wood, Hesse went to the home of Christopher W, police say. They ate together, then played computer games and Hesse turned in at 2am.\nHesse shared a series of pictures with a friend via WhatsApp which showed him washing a knife under water\nAnother picture showed a folded up knife along with the message 'think that's enough equipment'\nThe body of the boy was discovered by police in the cellar of a house by his stepfather. Police and forensics are pictured taking the body away on Tuesday\nHe murdered the friend he met at a technical college the next day and did not leave the apartment again until Thursday night when he turned himself in, police say.\nUnlike in many other criminal cases in the country, the suspect was fully named in German media as a police hunt got underway.\nSuspects in Germany are identified only by their first name and the first letter of their surname because of the country's strict privacy laws.\nHesse went into the Thessaloniki Grill in Herne at 9.07pm to ask the owners to call police.\nThe owner Cheitidis said: 'He came in here at 8.10pm in black clothes with an umbrella and carrying a sack of onions in one hand.\nHesse is said to have written in an Internet chat room in the hours following the brutal murder of Jaden: 'I have cut myself in the hand as I fought the 120kg beast'.

Officers made the grim discovery of another body inside last night\n'The picture of my stepson lying there dead....I will never forget this,' said Pascal R., 34, who found the boy dead from numerous stab wounds on Monday evening. 'I found him lying in a giant lake of his own blood.'\nPolice say Hesse, a martial arts fanatic, lured Jaden into the house and then into the cellar where he recorded his brutal murder. It is unclear whether there was a sexual motive.\nDetectives on a specially formed murder squad believed he may have killed another person. At the time they said he appeared on an Internet chat room in the hours following the killing to say he had attacked a woman, adding: 'She offered more resistance than the child.'\nHesse, who was this afternoon revealed to have been rejected by the German Bundeswehr army for service because he was too unstable, mentioned 'torture' to get the woman's bank details and pin card number.\nHesse had lived in the house where he killed Jaden for many years with his parents, but he was home alone since the beginning of the year with his sister Sandra after his mother and father moved.\nInvestigation: Forensics descended on a flat in Herne, Germany today after police discovered a body inside\nPolice rushed to the apartment last night after seeing that it was on fire - only to find a body inside\nThe corpse of a man was found inside a burning building last night.

Maurice and Steven, his stepbrothers, and Jaden stayed at home.'\nHe said at 6pm on Monday evening the doorbell to his home rang. Hesse was there and he asked Jaden if he could come to his home to help him set up a pair of ladders.\nHe went with him. The parents returned home two hours later and Jaden had not returned home. 'I went over and banged and yelled but no-one answered,' said the stepfather.\n'Something bad has happened,' Jeanette remembered saying to her husband. It had; Jaden was murdered with more than 40 stab wounds.\nInterpol helped in the search for Marcel Hesse, 19, a bespectacled martial arts enthusiast, who allegedly carried out the murder at his home in the town of Herne.

'I wanted to give him a massage on his heart but blood was streaming from his wounds,' he added.\nPolice later said as the boy was stabbed multiple times Hesse filmed his demise and posted video and stills on the so-called 'Darknet' - the lurid, unpatrolled side of cyberspace specialising in pornography, paedophilia, drugs and 'snuff' movies.\nIt was a Darknet user - who claimed to know the killer - who was upset by the images of the little boy who contacted police to tell them; 'I have just seen a boy murdered on the Internet.'\nThe alleged killer also entered a chatroom after the murder and held his bloodstained hands up to the camera.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4300230/Child-killer-held-Germany-two-bodies-found.html"}
