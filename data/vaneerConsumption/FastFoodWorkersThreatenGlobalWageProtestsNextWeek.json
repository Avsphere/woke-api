Organizers say that protests around the world will include cities in Europe, Asia, South America and Asia, among others.\nAdvocacy groups involved in planning the strikes include Fast Food Forward and Hungry for Justice, supported by the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association, which represents about 12 million workers in 126 countries.\nBoth McDonald's, the world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue, which has drawn the ire of many of the prospective strikers, and Burger King defended their treatment of employees in separate statements.\nThe planned strikes come at a time when Democrats have been mounting efforts to raise the federal minimum wage ahead of this year's midterm congressional elections, seeing income inequality as a powerful campaign issue.\nPresident Barack Obama has pushed Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, up from the current $7.25, a move the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has resisted.\n-The Reuters","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/fast-food-workers-threaten-global-wage-protests-next-week-n99766"}
