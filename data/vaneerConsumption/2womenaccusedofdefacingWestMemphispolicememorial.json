Memphis television station WMC reported that one of the women reportedly carved her own name into the memorial, which honors officers who died in the line of duty.\nNineteen-year-old Lacey Rose Friddle and 25-year-old Jessica May Lapradd were arrested Saturday and remained jailed Monday morning on suspicion of criminal mischief and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Jail records don't list attorneys.\nThe memorial opened less than two weeks ago, about four years after two West Memphis officers were shot to death during a traffic stop.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/jun/16/2-women-accused-defacing-west-memphis-police-memor/"}
