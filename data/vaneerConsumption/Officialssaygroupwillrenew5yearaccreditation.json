Superintendent Steve Green and the district’s school board were informed Wednesday.\nThe school district “has a clear purpose,” Green said in a press release late Wednesday afternoon. “We know who we are, and we know who we aren’t. As AdvancED noted: we are taking deliberate and strategic actions to ensure that every child, every day is being prepared and achieving success for their future.”\nThe team that visited the district will make their recommendation to the AdvancED Commission, which will finalize the district’s accreditation in June.\nThe district received full accreditation in January 2016 after several years on probation related to mismanagement issues that left the district without a superintendent and more than $14 million in debt in early 2013.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/dekalb-schools-recommended-for-year-accreditation-renewal-officials-say/Yfv2IDd9A7twwozN8lJjAN/"}
