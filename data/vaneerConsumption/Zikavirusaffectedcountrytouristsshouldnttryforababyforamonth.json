Men whose partners are or may be pregnant should also use condoms for 28 days\nZika has been linked to birth defects in thousands of Brazilian babies, born with heads smaller than normal and undeveloped brains. Pictured is Gleyse Kelly da Silva, holding her daughter Maria Giovana, in Recife, Brazil\nSymptoms include a rash, fever, conjunctivitis and headache and, to date, 23 countries have been affected.\nPregnant women or those trying for a child have already been officially warned to avoid travelling to South America.\nProfessor Laura Rodrigues, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'I think it's sensible for someone to who is pregnant, or planning to get pregnant, should avoid travelling to countries with Zika.'\nThe World Health Organisation says there is still insufficient evidence to make the link between Zika being transmitted through sex.\nBut the Public Health England website states: 'Sexual transmission of Zika virus has been recorded in a limited number of cases, and the risk of sexual transmission of Zika virus is thought to be very low.\n'However, if a female partner is at risk of getting pregnant, or is already pregnant, condom use is advised for a male traveller:\n* For 28 days after his return from a Zika transmission area if he had no symptoms of unexplained fever and rash\n* For 6 months following recovery if a clinical illness compatible with Zika virus infection or laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection was reported\nIt adds: 'This is a precaution and may be revised as more information becomes available.'\nTo date, 23 countries have been affected by Zika. Yesterday, scientists warned the Zika virus has 'explosive pandemic potential', while the World Health Organisation said up to four million people could be infected\nYesterday, scientists warned the Zika virus has 'explosive pandemic potential'.\nAnd the World Health Organisation said the mosquito-borne disease had gone from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions, admitting up to four million people could be infected.\nThere is clear scientific evidence the virus is transmitted by the same type of mosquito that spreads other tropical diseases, such as dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever.\nBut there are also fears the virus may be passed on through sex, following two reports in medical literature.\nOne states that Zika was found in the semen of a man from Tahiti, the other that the virus was passed from a husband to his wife after intercourse.\nHOW ELSE COULD ZIKA POTENTIALLY BE TRANSMITTED? In a statement this week, the World Health Organisation addressed other concerns about how the virus may be spread. It said: Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent mechanism. Standard precautions that are already in place for ensuring safe blood donations and transfusions should be followed. There is currently no evidence that Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. Mothers in areas with Zika should follow the WHO recommendations on breastfeeding. This is exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding with complementary foods up to 2 years or beyond.\nA case, published in 2011, details the story of Professor Brian Foy, who claims he passed Zika to his wife through sex.\nProfessor Foy, a biologist from the University of Colorado, contracted the virus while on a field trip to Senegal.\nHe and his colleague had been collecting mosquitoes in a south-eastern village called Bandafassi, where they were often bitten.\nFive days after his return home, Professor Foy fell ill - his symptoms included extreme tiredness, swollen wrists, rashes and painful urination.\nHe also had skin problems and what appeared to be blood in his semen.\nA few weeks later his wife also developed similar symptoms, along with extreme sensitivity to light, but their four children were unharmed.\nThe scientists were baffled as to what Mrs Foy had caught until a year later when, on a hunch, they carried out a battery of tests and concluded that sexual contact between the couple was the most likely cause.\nProfessor Foy and the co-authors of his paper, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, believe it is the first instance of sexual transmission of a mosquito-born virus between humans.\nSuch a possibility has been explored before among animals, but not in humans.\nIn his paper, he added the crucial final piece to the puzzle: ‘Patients 1 and 3 (Mr and Mrs Foy) reported having vaginal sexual intercourse in the days after patient 1 returned home but before the onset of his clinical illness.\n‘My wife wasn't happy with what happened afterwards.'\nThe guidance comes following fears the virus can be passed on through sex after two reports in medical literature. One states Zika was found in the semen of a man from Tahiti, the other that the virus was passed from a husband to his wife after intercourse\nThen there is the case of the Tahitian patient who was found to have the Zika virus in his semen - leading the scientists reporting his case to conclude it can be transmitted through sex.\nWriting in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases last year, they explained how the 44-year-old had developed symptoms of the virus during an outbreak in French Polynesia.\nThese included a low-grade fever, a lack of energy and joint pain.\nTwo weeks after recovering however, he noticed blood in his semen and sought treatment.\nAnd because he had recently experienced symptoms of Zika, he was referred for tests at the country's Institut Louis Malardé, in Papeete.\nIn his paper, Dr Didier Musso, director of the infectious disease unit, explains the patient had no signs of conditions that usually cause blood in the urine - such as a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate.\nHe had also not come into physical contact with anyone who was actively suffering with the Zika virus.\nBut further tests revealed the virus was present not only in his semen - but also his urine.\n........................................................................................................................................................\nThe Zika virus: Everything you need to know...\nWHAT IS ZIKA?\nThe Zika (ZEE'-ka) virus was first discovered in monkey in Uganda in 1947 - its name comes from the Zika forest where it was first discovered.\nIt is native mainly to tropical Africa, with outbreaks in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It appeared in Brazil last year and has since been seen in many Latin American countries and Caribbean islands.\nHOW IS IT SPREAD?\nIt is transmitted through bites from the same kind of mosquitoes that can spread other tropical diseases, like dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever.\nIt is not known to spread from person to person.\nInvestigators, though, are exploring the possibility that the virus can be passed on through sex - it was found in one man's semen in Tahiti and there's been another report of possible spread of the virus through sex.\nAn Aedes Aegypti mosquito on human skin in a lab in Cali, Colombia. Scientists there are studying the genetics and biology of this mosquito, which transmits the Zika virus\nThe World Health Organisation says Zika is rapidly spreading in the Americas because it is new to the region and people are not immune to it. Furthermore, the Aedes aegypti mosquito (pictured) that carries it is just extremely widespread\nThe World Health Organisation says Zika is rapidly spreading in the Americas because it is new to the region, people aren't immune to it, and the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries it is just about everywhere - including along the southern United States.\nCanada and Chile are the only places without this mosquito.\nARE THERE SYMPTOMS?\nExperts think most people infected with Zika virus don't get sick.\nAnd those that do usually develop mild symptoms - fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes - which usually last no more than a week.\nThere is no specific medicine and there hasn't been a vaccine developed for it, which is the case for some other tropical illnesses that cause periodic outbreaks.\nGLAXO CONSIDERING USING VACCINE TECHNOLOGY FOR ZIKA GlaxoSmithKline Plc is concluding feasibility studies evaluating whether its vaccine technology is suitable for the Zika virus, a spokeswoman has confirmed. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika, which typically causes mild fevers and rashes, although about 80 percent of those infected show no symptoms. 'We're concluding our feasibility studies as quickly as we can to see if our vaccine technology platforms might be suitable for working on Zika,' a Glaxo spokeswoman said in an email. She declined to provide details but added that vaccine development typically takes 10 to 15 years.\nWHY IS IT A CONCERN NOW?\nIn Brazil, there has been mounting evidence linking Zika infection in pregnant women to a rare birth defect called microcephaly, in which a newborn's head is smaller than normal and the brain may not have developed properly.\nBrazilian health officials last October noticed a spike in cases of microcephaly in tandem with the Zika outbreak.\nThe connection to Zika is still being investigated, and officials note there are many causes of the condition. Nearly 4,000 cases have been recorded.\nMeanwhile, doctors have noted increased reports of a nerve condition called Guillain-Barre that can cause paralysis.\nBut the link to the Zika virus is not clear; other infections can spark the problem, including dengue fever.\nCAN THE SPREAD BE STOPPED?\nIndividuals can protect themselves from mosquito bites by using insect repellents, and wearing long sleeves and long pants - especially during daylight, when the mosquitoes tend to be most active, health officials say.\nEliminating breeding spots and controlling mosquito populations can help prevent the spread of the virus.\nHAVE THERE BEEN CASES IN THE US?\nYes, but in tourists. Since 2007 there have been more than two dozen cases diagnosed in the US all travellers who are believed to have caught it overseas.\n(Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have each had a recent case that didn't involve a traveler.)\nThere is no vaccine or treatment for Zika, which typically causes mild fevers and rashes, although about 80 per cent of those infected show no symptoms\nThe kind of mosquito that spreads Zika is found along the southern states, so experts think it's likely the pests may end up spreading the virus there.\nBut officials also have said Zika infections probably won't be a big problem in the US for a number of reasons, including the more common use of air conditioning and door and window screens.\nRecent U.S. outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya - carried by the same mosquito - suggest any Zika outbreaks may be relatively small, said Dr. Lyle Petersen of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWHAT ARE THE TRAVEL ADVISORIES?\nUS health officials recommend that pregnant women should consider postponing trips to 22 destinations. Latin America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname and Venezuela. In the Caribbean: Barbados, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Martinique, St. Martin and Puerto Rico. Also, Cape Verde, off the coast of western Africa; and Samoa in the South Pacific.\nIn Brazil, most of the mothers who had babies with microcephaly were apparently infected during the first trimester, but there is some evidence the birth defect can occur later in the pregnancy, CDC officials say.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3422727/Don-t-try-baby-month-partner-just-returned-Zika-affected-country-women-told.html"}
