The prime minister’s rise in popularity was illustrated by featuring him on a steep incline comprised of dead Palestinian babies.\nThursday’s cartoon is not the first time Netanyahu has been featured as a Nazi. In January of last year Fatah posted a photoshopped image of the prime minister in an SS uniform. The Palestinian Authority and Fatah movement have further claimed that Israel as a whole is guilty of Nazi-like transgressions.
