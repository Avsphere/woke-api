But if you have one of the best indoor electric grills? You can channel your inner grill master wherever, whenever. Whether you're in an apartment without outdoor space or you'd rather not sear your favorite protein the winter, trust me — these grills are the perfect solution.\nIndoor grills use electric heating elements instead of charcoal or gas to mimic the beloved results of outdoor grilling: even grill marks, a good sear, and juicy flavor.\nIn order to ensure your indoor grilling experience is a success, there are a few important things to remember. Josh Evans, executive chef at LongHorn Steakhouse, tells Bustle that proper ventilation is key. Make sure your stove's exhaust hood is turned on when using your indoor grill, or if you don't have a built-in exhaust, turn on a fan and open a window. The other big factors are taste and preparation. Use seasonings like pepper, granulated onion and garlic, and smoked salt to achieve that coveted charred taste. And, to \"lock in a hard, delicious sear on the outside of your steak,\" or whatever else you're preparing, Chef Evans recommends cranking up your grill to high and using a reliable pair of cooking tongs to keep all the juices intact.\nWith these pro tips in mind, here, shop five of the best indoor electric grills available on Amazon.
