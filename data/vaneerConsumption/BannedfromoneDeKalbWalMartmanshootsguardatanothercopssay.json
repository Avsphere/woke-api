Now he is accused of aggravated assault on the guard at the Fairington Road Wal-Mart.\nSmalls was ordered not to return to the first store after a shoplifting conviction. Police say he chose the Fairington Road store to lift 12 DVDs on March 31, leading to a confrontation with the guard.\nThe shooting, which happened to be the second in five months at the Fairington Road store, left the worker with a foot injury. He had to have surgery but was recovering well a few days later, according to Channel 2 Action News.\nPolice released video of the incident to media and asked for the public’s help identifying the shooter.\nPolice didn’t say how Smalls was ultimately found.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/banned-from-one-dekalb-wal-mart-man-shoots-guard-another-cops-say/wJs6X7SEUtT9yfChUWJHuJ/"}
