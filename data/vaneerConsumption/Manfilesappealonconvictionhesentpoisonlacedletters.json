(AP) — A Mississippi man seeks to overturn his 2014 conviction that he sent poison-laced letters to President Barack Obama and others.\nThe Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal (http://bit.ly/1Quw2hj ) reports that James Everett Dutschke (DUHST'-kee) has asked the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn dismissal of earlier conviction appeals in the Northern District of Mississippi.\nIn a five-page, hand-written document filed Monday, Dutschke insists his request was not \"frivolous\" because he is \"without any legal counsel or guidance\" to properly proceed in the courts.\nDutschke pleaded guilty in early 2014 to four counts that he manufactured the poison ricin and mailed it in threats to the president and others, including U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker and Lee County Justice Court Judge Sadie Holland.\n___","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420962/Man-files-appeal-conviction-sent-poison-laced-letters.html"}
