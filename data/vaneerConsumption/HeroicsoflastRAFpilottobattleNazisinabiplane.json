As a result, they saw significant use during the First World War, and were favoured by pilots as their lightness and stiffness made them the ideal toll during dog fights with the enemy. However, by the 1930s biplanes had started to reach their performance limit and were slowly replaced throughout Europe by monoplanes. By the start of the Second World War, several air forces still had biplane combat aircraft in frontline use, such as the Royal Air Force's Gloster Gladiator. But their use faded throughout the war, with more purpose-built aircraft, such as the Submarine Spitfire, becoming favoured among British pilots.\nHe was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal for his bravery in Norway and the Norwegian Cross - the equivalent of the Victoria Cross - for helping the country in its time of need.\nThe day before he had been due at Buckingham Palace to receive his decorations in March 1941, he was tasked with intercepting a German Junkers 88 bomber off the Cornish coast.\nHis Westland Whirlwind fighter was badly damaged and he was forced to make a crash landing.\nHe suffered a fractured skull and broken arm in the process.\nKitchener's medals, his flying goggles and hat, photographs and official letters and log books, were sold by his family through Duke's Auctioneers in Dorchester, Dorset.\nKitchener, from Crowborough, East Sussex, joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1937 at the age of 23.\nHe left the RAF in 1945 and worked in local government in Kent.\nHe died in 2010 aged 95.\nMedals won by Kitchener include (top row) The Distinguished Flying Medal, the Air Efficiency Award, the Air Crew Europe Star, (bottom row) the 1939-45 War Medal and the 1939-45 Star","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301482/Heroics-RAF-pilot-battle-Nazis-biplane.html"}
