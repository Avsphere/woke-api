He was initially told it was inoperable\nA hernia occurs when an internal part of the body â€“ usually the bowel or fatty tissue - pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall.\nMr Williams was originally told his hernia, which was ten times bigger than the usual size, was inoperable.\n'If I coughed and when I was standing my stomach shot out like a football. I had different belts to try and keep it in but nothing worked,' he said.\n'People accused my of shoplifting, they thought I was hiding something.\n'On another occasion when I had my Jack Russell terrier with me someone asked why I hadn't given him the football and another person even asked when my twins were due.\n'People would stare at me whereever I went. It affected me not only mentally, and physically, but emotionally too.\n'It was highly embarrassing and depressing. It was awful.'\nThe 67-year-old, pictured after surgery to correct the giant hernia, said the hernia made his life very difficult. He said he was once accused of shoplifting and was subjected to taunts about 'being pregnant'\nEventually, he was referred to consultant plastic surgeon Graham Offer who told him about a ground-breaking new procedure.\nThe father-of-two, from Leicester, underwent a complex six-hour operation which involved splitting the muscle layers of his abdomen and moving them over each other like a sandwich.\nIf I coughed and when I was standing my stomach shot out like a football Glenn Williams, 67\nShocking video footage shows Mr Williams lying on a hospital trolley and being asked to cough by a doctor.\nAs he coughs, the giant hernia can be seen inflating to the size of a football.\nMr Williams said his life had been changed by the pioneering operation at Leicester Royal Infirmary.\n'My life when I had the hernia made me quite depressed, as it got bigger and bigger and I found I could do less and less because the weight of it.\n'It caused me to suffer with back ache, dizzy spells, aches in legs, it was just horrible,' he said.\n'I thought the hernia was just something I would have to live with after my bowel cancer operation.\n'But at last I can look in the mirror again and not find my reflection repulsive.\n'I am over the moon, having a normal body not having people stare at me is just amazing.'\nThe video shows Mr Williams lying down on a hospital couch, where the hernia is flat. A doctor then asks him to cough, which makes it inflate to the size of a football\nAs Mr Williams coughs, the hernia, which measured 20cm by 30cm, becomes visible again\nIncredibly, the surgery corrected the condition by moving muscle layers of his abdomen over each other, using a type of mesh.\nMr Offer, who is a leading specialist in complex abdominal wall re-construction, said it was the biggest hernia he had ever operated on.\nHis work focuses on cases where a defect or hole in the abdominal wall occurs which the patient's bowel then moves through and pushes out under the skin.\n'It was one of the biggest ones you can get. We had to close the 20cm x 30cm gap in the abdominal wall,' he said.\n'A few years ago hernias like Glenn's would have been inoperable.\n'I brought together the three main hernia surgery techniques used in abdominal wall reconstruction and developed a method to combine them.\n'It means that we can now operate on patients who would have otherwise been told that nothing could be done.'\nMr Williams was operated on by consultant plastic surgeon Graham Offer who told him about a ground-breaking new procedure.
