They chose war over peace, Netanyahu over Obama and bullying over reason.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) on Tuesday gave President Barack Obama the support he needed to prevent a disapproval resolution from emerging from the Senate. Prior to Tuesday, Obama had garnered 38 votes which was enough for him to sustain a veto if a resolution of disapproval were to emerge. With 41 votes, that resolution won’t make a difference.\nAlso on Tuesday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. VA) declared his opposition to the Iran deal.\nRead my statement on my decision to vote against the #IranDeal: http://t.co/gNVBMwFNo0 — Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) September 8, 2015\nParsi has made no secret of his disdain for AIPAC, almost making it his mission to discredit them over their support for the State of Israel. Parsi has openly been referred to as “someone who does a lot of leg-work for the Iranian regime.” Reporter Eli Lake also broke down the close, years-long relationship between Parsi and Iranian Foreign Minister and the regime’s lead nuclear negotiator Javad Zarif. Parsi posted his personal statement in response to his perceived victory over AIPAC on Twitter.\nNIAC Action statement on the victory of 41 Senators Backing the #IranDeal http://t.co/UqCWTXBL3N — Trita Parsi (@tparsi) September 8, 2015\nAIPAC serves as the most powerful pro-Israel lobbyist group in the United States and they have vowed to fight tooth and nail to see the defeat of Obama’s nuclear accords with Iran. They have lobbied Congress vigorously to come out against the deal, stating time and again that the Iran deal provides the Islamic Republic with billions of dollars with which they can continue to fund their terrorist proxies and destructive endeavors worldwide. And it allows them to become a full-fledged nuclear power when the deal expires in just 10 years or through cheating—something with which they have a history of familiarity.\nOn Monday, the State Department confirmed that Iran-backed Houthi terrorists took a number of Americans hostage in the besieged Yemeni nation. Following suit with their Iranian teachers, the Houthis are notorious for employing their slogan, “God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam.”\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz and on Facebook.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/09/08/iran-deal-pro-regime-lobby-gloats-at-aipac/"}
