Many government offices in metro Atlanta delayed opening Tuesday until late morning. Full list of closings.\nChannel 2 meteorologist Karen Minton said the chance of rain is 40 percent Tuesday morning, with skies clearing during the afternoon, when highs will be in the low 40s.\nA 10 percent chance of rain is forecast for Wednesday, along with highs in the low 40s and lows around 27.\nCheck the full forecast and track changes.\nWednesday will be partly cloudy and very cold, with morning lows in the mid-teens followed by afternoon highs only around 30 degrees.\nA 30 percent chance of precipitation is forecast for Friday, when lows will be in the upper teens and highs in the mid-30s.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-weather-icing-knocks-out-power-thousands/UKCOOYakLUoKJKSyvNiWAP/"}
