I don’t deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things. She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she’s doing because she, as she has said, hasn’t found her way and has a lack of focus in her life.\nPodesta replied in part advising against dragging in who sided with or against Chelsea Clinton.\nAs reported previously by Breitbart News, Band helped the former president found the Clinton Global Initiative, which “obtained approval from the State Department for a paid consulting arrangement between Bill Clinton and Band,” one of the many examples of cronyism that occurred during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State. Huma Abedin, Hillary’s extremely close aide who later separated from her husband Anthony Weiner, advised Teneo while working in Hillary’s State Department — while also working as a consultant for the William J. Clinton Foundation.\nWikileaks released the second batch of Podesta emails Monday, the morning after the second presidential debate.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/10/10/veteran-clinton-aide-called-chelsea-clinton-a-spoiled-brat-kid/"}
