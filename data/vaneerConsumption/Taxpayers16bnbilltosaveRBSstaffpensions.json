I doubt they will any future sales for a considerable period of time – and certainly not this year.’\nGeorge Osborne came under fire last April when he sold an initial 6 per cent stake in RBS at 330p each, resulting in a £1billion loss for taxpayers.\nThe previous government paid more than £5 per share when it rescued the bank with a £46billion bail-out during the financial crisis.\nThe huge bill to support RBS’s gold plated final salary scheme will ensure it can continue to pay a generous retirement income to 222,000 members, including 35,000 current staff.\nJonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This bank continues to be a millstone around taxpayers necks as it announces plans to plug a monstrous deficit in its hugely generous final-salary pension scheme.’\nThe vast majority of private sector firms have been forced to shut down their final salary pensions – which pay a guaranteed income based on length of service and salary at retirement - because they are so expensive.\nInsiders at RBS stressed that former executives including disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin are members of a separate company pension scheme – although it is still backed by taxpayers.\nThe bank also revealed it had racked up another £2.5billion in clean-up costs, meaning it will register its eighth consecutive annual loss when it announces its results later this month\nMr Goodwin enjoys a £342,500 annual income from his executive pension, despite steering RBS to the brink.\nRBS closed its final salary pension to new staff in 2006, meaning none of its bosses – including chief executive Ross McEwan - are members.\nInsiders at the bank stressed that the vast majority of beneficiaries of the pension scheme are ordinary workers rather than fat cat bosses, with average annual pay-outs £10,700.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3420204/Our-1-6bn-bill-save-RBS-staff-pensions-Tougher-accounting-rules-mean-Bank-need-money-plug-black-hole-final-salary-scheme.html"}
