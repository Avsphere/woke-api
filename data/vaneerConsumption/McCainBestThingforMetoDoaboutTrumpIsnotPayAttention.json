John McCain (R-AZ) appeared Friday on “The Dan Patrick Show” on NBC Sports and host Dan Patrick asked him if he would “want a piece” of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump in his prime.\nMcCain, who was backed by Trump in 2008 when he ran for president, made it known that he was backing Lindsey Graham over Trump for the GOP primary shortly after Trump said McCain was not a “war hero.”\nThe former presidential candidate said that the best thing for him to when it comes to Trump, is “not pay attention.”\n“I think the best thing for me to do seriously about Mr. Trump is not pay attention. I’ve got a lot of work to do in the Senate and Armed Services Committee. I don’t think its beneficial to me,” responded McCain. “So, I’m trying to do my work and not get involved anymore with Mr. Trump.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/05/mccain-best-thing-for-me-to-do-about-trump-is-not-pay-attention/"}
