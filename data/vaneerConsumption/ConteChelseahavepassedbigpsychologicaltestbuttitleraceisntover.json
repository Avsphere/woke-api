Our answer was very good. For this reason I must be pleased.\n“But we must think that this race is open. We are ready to fight until the end.”\nChelsea’s prospects of a trophy double in Conte’s first season in charge remain alive, with 12 points needed from the final five games to clinch the league title before the May 27 FA Cup final with Arsenal.\n“Everyone feels a bit of pressure,” Conte added.\nCosta ended a seven-match scoreless streak for Chelsea with goals at either end of the second half, taking his tally to 51 in 85 Premier League games.\nDiego Costa’s first strike was his 50th goal in the #PL – he's the 8th fastest player to reach the milestone in the competition #CHESOU pic.twitter.com/s82h59hIBf — Premier League (@premierleague) April 26, 2017\nConte said: “For strikers it’s very important to score. Goals are your life.\n“I always said I’m very pleased with his commitment, his work for the team. I was always confident about him.\n“Now he must continue.”\nEden Hazard has scored 15 #PL goals this season – his best return in a single campaign in the competition #CHESOU pic.twitter.com/mKDqNLtVf6 — Premier League (@premierleague) April 26, 2017\nEden Hazard and Gary Cahill scored in the first half for Chelsea, while former Blues duo Oriol Romeu and Ryan Bertrand replied for Saints as Conte’s men conceded for an 11th successive Premier League game.\nConte’s frustration with his side’s defending was evident when he kicked a medical bag in his technical area during the second half.\nHe said: “In that moment I wanted to kick the ball and I took the bag as a ball, because sometimes I want to play.”\nAntonio Conte\nJohn Terry came off the substitutes’ bench for his 714th Chelsea appearance and first in the league since November.\nTerry, who has won 14 major trophies at Chelsea, will finish his Stamford Bridge career this summer and may do so lifting more silverware.\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel rued the concession of goals at crucial periods in the game.\n“It’s a shame that with the quality of this game we conceded four goals,” Puel said.\n“We conceded the goals in bad moments, after five minutes, just before half-time, just after half-time… this made the difference.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4446744/Conte-Chelsea-passed-big-psychological-test-title-race-isn-t-over.html"}
