The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nFrom NBC Los Angeles\nFirst a cadaver dog, now chemical analysis support the suspicions of a retired police detective that human remains were buried in the foothills above Hollywood decades ago, NBC4 has learned.\nAnalysis of soil taken from a location indicated by the cadaver dog found chemical markers for human decomposition, said the scientist who performed the labwork at the request of the retired detective.\nIt's the theory of former detective that as many as 10 long-unsolved slayings of young women in Los Angeles in the 1940's were committed by a single serial killer.\nWhat adds poignance to Hodel's suspicion is his personal connection to the suspect he's identified: the late medical doctor George Hodel -- the retired detective's father.\n\"I see him as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" said Hodel, alluding to the fictional split personality depicted in one of Hollywood's first horror films. \"Unfortunately, the monster, Mr. Hyde, was stronger and over-ruled the good.\"\nHodel's suspicions date back more than a decade. After his father's death, going through possessions, Hodel came across evidence that implicated his father in the infamous 1947 dismemberment murder of a young woman named Elizabeth Short, remembered to this day as the Black Dahlia.\nWriting books and continuing his research, Hodel came to suspect his father had killed repeatedly before fleeing to Asia in the late 1940s.\nDuring that decade, the Hodels lived in what is now regarded as a Hollywood landmark, the Sowden House designed by the famed architect Lloyd Wright in the distinctive Mayan block style that was developed by his even more famous father Frank Lloyd Wright.\nRecords long stored in the District Attorney's office confirm that the doctor had come under suspicion in the Dahlia case, and that police had planted a listening bug in the house. Transcripts reveal that detectives heard him discussing the Dahlia at one point. At another time, they heard from the basement what sounded like a woman being attacked.\nHodel believes his father committed murders in or near the house, and in some cases buried the remains nearby in unmarked graves.\nIn 2012, Hodel was able to return to the Sowden house when he was invited to participate in a TV program being recorded there. Hodel got permission to bring along another retired cop, former Mammoth Lakes Police Sgt. Paul Dostie, who has worked extensively with Buster, his search dog.\nBuster indicated a scent of human decomposition at several locations, including in the alley behind the house. But where the scent is picked up does not necessarily mean that is where the chemical remains are located; carried over time by water or gravity, the marker molecules can migrate considerable distances, according to forensic anthropologist Arpad Vass, PhD, a pioneer in chemical analysis of human decomposition.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-cop-cites-new-evidence-his-dad-was-black-dahlia-n119861"}
