'It was also important for us to win the game against the strong pressure of San Jose.'\nThe wonder strike flew for virtually 100 yards before taking a few bounces into the net, much to the astonishment of the opposition defence â€“ with their keeper still in the opposition half of the pitch.\nNo defenders could get near the ball as it raced into the net to extend Bolivar's lead to 3-1\nBolivar's players congratulate Dituro after watching his shot travel the length of the pitch\nThe manager couldn't believe what he was seeing as his side won the tournament in Bolivia\nThe local press heaped praise on Dituro, exclaiming, 'Goalkeeper Matias Dituro of Bolivar had the stadium in his pocket when he scored from goal to goal.'\nAnd the sensational shot-stopper has history with being a goal king having scored in November 2015 when he played for the 'Pumas,' notching a late equaliser against Santiago Wanderers.\nBolivar are currently sitting top of the table of the Bolivian League with 28 points.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4447414/Keeper-scores-amazing-stoppage-time-goal.html"}
