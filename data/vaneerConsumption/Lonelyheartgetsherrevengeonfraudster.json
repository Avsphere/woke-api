Two other men involved in the scam remain at large.\nIn handcuffs: Ajibola Daudu, 43, admitted fraud at Chester Crown Court and was jailed for three years and nine months\nWhen she finally accepted she was being conned, Mrs Hawes bravely strung Daudu along for two months and engineered the meeting at which police arrested him.\nShe told the court in a victim impact statement that her search for companionship had been 'exposed in the most cruel manner'.\nShe said: 'They made me feel so special and so loved. I can't believe this has happened to me. It all sounds so unbelievable.'\nShe said that they were the actions of 'evil people' and that she was being 'gamed' and was 'totally embarrassed, humiliated and ashamed'.\nShe 'met' a man calling himself John Wilmotts on the day she joined Plenty of Fish. He claimed to be an intelligence agent and said his father had died in Dubai.\nBut there were complications with the paperwork needed to release his inheritance. Mrs Hawes agreed to pay £2,700 to allow 'Mr Wilmotts' to travel to Dubai.\nShe then travelled there herself and was told she would need to pay another £10,000 for an anti-money laundering certificate, which she did.\nDaudu, who lived on this road in Purfleet, Essex, had an intimate relationship with his victim\nDaudu then told her they would need more money to exchange the cash from dollars to pounds.\nShe sold some jewellery and borrowed £10,000 from a friend and handed him £12,000 in cash at an hotel in London in June 2016.\nDaudu then persuaded her to hand over a further £9,000, secured by a bank loan, because Brexit had increased the price of a currency conversion certificate.\nShe then became suspicious and spoke to police. Daudu then said he needed another £27,500. She arranged a meeting in London and officers arrested him.\nIn total Mrs Hawes lost £100,000 in money she handed over and interest on loans.\nBut a basis of plea which was put forward by Daudu, and accepted by the prosecution, said that he had received no more than £26,000.\nAnna Price, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Hawes joined Plenty of Fish in February 2015. On the first day of her joining 'Mr Wilmotts' began speaking to her.\nIn February 2016 Mrs Hawes met 'Doug' at a Crowne Plaza hotel in London (file picture) and a case of money was brought to the hotel room by a security guard\nThe pair began messaging each other regularly and met twice in March 2015. 'Mr Wilmotts' said that his children and their mother lived on the Wirral and that he was an intelligence agent.\nAfter March the relationship became long distance due to ''Mr Wilmotts's' job.\n'Mr Wilmotts' then explained to Mrs Hawes that his father had died in Dubai but he was struggling to make the necessary arrangements to get a £7million inheritance left to him.\nVictim Mrs Hawes joined Plenty of Fish (pictured) in 2015, and on the first day a man called 'John Wilmotts' began speaking to her\nMs Price said it was at this point Mrs Hawes offered to help by paying £1,500 and £1,200 to 'cover the wages of stand in employees so that he [\"Mr Wilmotts\"] could travel to Dubai'.\nShe said that Mrs Hawes now believes that this was a way of 'testing willingness to hand over money'.\nIn June 2015 Mrs Hawes travelled to Dubai on 'Mr Wilmotts's' behalf and met a man called 'Phillip'.\nMs Price said that while Mrs Hawes was there everything was paid for and she was shown a suitcase with a large amount of cash - supposedly £7million.\nMrs Hawes was given an anti-money laundering certificate in relation to the money which then disappeared. She was told that it would cost £10,000 to replace.\nBelieving she would be paid back when 'Mr Wilmotts' received the inheritance, she paid for the replacement certificate.\nMs Price said that on her return to England she paid over further large sums for more certificates to 'Phillip'.\nIn October 2015 Mrs Hawes received a phone call from someone called 'Doug Benjamin'. He said that he was head of security and 'Mr Wilmotts's' agent and he had been asked by 'Phillip' to take over for him.\n'Doug' was Daudu. 'Doug' told Mrs Hawes that he had spent time in the embassy working with the United Nations, had worked undercover and had dealings with the IRA.\n'Doug' and Mrs Hawes met on a number of occasions in London - sometimes to hand over money, sometimes to spend time together.\nAt the end of 2015 their relationship became 'intimate'. Mrs Hawes was then told by 'Doug' that he had also lent money to 'Mr Wilmotts' to try and get the inheritance back and was struggling financially.\nMs Price said that Mrs Hawes had started to borrow money off family and friends to pay 'Mr Wilmotts' because she believed he needed the cash to get the money through customs.\nIn February 2016 she met 'Doug' at a Crowne Plaza hotel in London and a case of money was brought to the hotel room by a security guard.\nMrs Hawes was given a code to open the case and it appeared to be full of cash, this time US dollars.\nThere was a conversation between 'Doug' and the security guard over the fact it was meant to be British currency and the security guard asked for a 'conversion certificate'.\nMrs Hawes was told that it would cost £350,000 and they wouldn't be allowed to touch the money until they had it.\nMs Price said that at this point 'Doug' said that there was a cheaper way of getting the certificate but there was a 'sense of urgency'.\nMrs Hawes sold some jewellery and borrowed £10,000 from a friend and handed over £12,000 in cash to 'Doug' at a hotel in London in June 2016.\nMs Price said that later that month 'Doug' said the Brexit vote had an impact on the availability of the certificate and Mrs Hawes handed over a further £9,000 on July 5.\nPolice praise for victim as she helps to bring fraudster to justice Police have praised the courage of Lynn Hawes after she successfully helped bring Ajibola Daudu to justice. The victim continued to speak to Daudu, who she knew as 'Doug', for nearly two months after her suspicions were raised that she was being conned. She helped set up a meeting with him where he was arrested by police. Sergeant Kev Green, from Cheshire Police, said: 'This was a complex and sophisticated fraud. 'I believe Ajibola Daudu to be an intelligent and charismatic man, who utilised those attributes to skillfully secure the trust and affection of a vulnerable female. 'Knowing that the victim was fully committed to him, Daudu perpetuated the unachievable aspiration of companionship and happiness, making further requests for cash whilst continually shifting the goalposts. 'Daudu was content to financially exhaust the victim in this case to satisfy his own personal greed. 'Daudu failed to recognise the courage and determination of his victim, who once she realised was being scammed, was instrumental in his location and arrest. 'The judge has seen through Daudu's tears and recognised the sophistication of this scam and the long-lasting effect it will have on the victim by delivering the sentence of 45 months.'\nTo do this she took out a bank loan of £15,000 and gave £9,000 to 'Doug' and £6,000 back to her friend.\nAfter July 5 she became suspicious. Police had visited her on July 4 after Mrs Hawes family had called the police believing that she was being conned.\nMs Price said that Mrs Hawes reaction initially was that police were wrong.\nAfter July 5 she contacted the police who told her to keep in touch with 'Doug' until another meeting could be arranged.\nOn September 22 'Doug' asked for a further £27,500 for the conversion certificate and arranged a meeting in London. Police then arrested Daudu.\nNeither 'Mr Wilmotts' nor 'Phillip' have been found by police. Ms Price said that Daudu refused to be interviewed by police.\nShe said that Mrs Hawes had been 'completely convinced by them', 'swept off her feet' and 'she believed she and 'Mr Wilmotts' were going to have a lasting relationship'.\nMrs Hawes, bravely, read her own victim impact statement to the court where she said that her search for companionship had been 'exposed in the most cruel manner'.\nShe told the court that she had sex with Daudu three times and felt 'totally betrayed'. She added: 'I didn't think anyone could stoop so low.'\nShe said that she had been left with large debts both to her friends and family and to the bank which she will be paying 'long after he is out of prison'.\nJide Lanlehin, defending, said that Daudu wanted to apologise to Mrs Hawes.\nMr Lanlehin said that Daudu had 'become very close' to Mrs Hawes and he 'wished he had the courage at an earlier stage to tell her finally about what was going on.'\nMr Lanlehin said that Daudu had three children with an ex-partner who he regularly sees and had a law degree.\nAt this point Daudu, who had spent the entire hearing with his head in his hands, shouted to the court 'I deserve to lose everything for what I did to her' and started sobbing loudly.\nJailing him, Judge Nicolas Woodward said that Daudu had been involved in a 'planned, complicated, sophisticated and systematic' fraud.\nHe described the offence as a 'deliberate and shameless betrayal'. Daudu was jailed for a total of 45 months.\nSpeaking outside court Mrs Hawes said that she was 'pleased' with the sentence.\nShe said that she didn't believe Daudu was remorseful, adding: 'I've seen those tears before. He can put on an act. He has no remorse in my eyes.'\nShe said: 'It was just like a movie. There was at least six to seven people. They had everything, all the props. I felt it was 100 per cent genuine.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319222/Lonely-heart-gets-revenge-fraudster.html"}
