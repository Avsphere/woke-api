His fellow officers speak to Daily Mail Online of their feelings about a year of 'hell'\nScene: Canfield Drive in Ferguson where Brown's body was lying in a pool of blood with nine bullets in his body. It was left for four hours in the heat, uncovered, which was seen as a sign of disrespect\nAftermath: Demonstrations in the aftermath of Ferguson which included the use of the now discredited 'hands up, don't shoot' claim that Brown had said to Wilson 'don't shoot' as he put up his hands. In November the suburb was hit by extensive looting and arson after Wilson was cleared\nIn a tentative deal with the Justice Department, Ferguson Police have promised to make all officers wear body cameras and microphones, to be fitted within 180 days of the deal being implemented.\nCameras will have to be active for all traffic stops and arrests and are designed to promote accountability after the report found the force issues petty citations, makes baseless traffic stops and uses excessive force.\nThe deal follows seven months of negotiations and will, the force hopes, avert civil rights lawsuits that federal officials could bring against the department.\nIt will also require officers to justify every shot they fire, and lay out the options they had for using force and why the one they chose was appropriate at the time.\nPolice officers and court employees would be given training on 'bias-free policing' to help them recognize unconscious stereotyping.\nAnd the force will have to offer new training on proper stops, searches and arrests, as well as on use of force and appropriate responses to protesters.\nIn flames: Disorder on the streets of Ferguson after the decision to clear Darren Wilson\nExplosion of rage: The decision not to charge Darren Wilson over the death of Michael Brown was followed by riots in Ferguson, and protests further afield. Police cars were targeted and shops looted\nThe city also will develop a recruitment plan aimed at attracting diversity to the almost all-white police force in a city of 21,000 people - two thirds of them black.\nFerguson officials also agreed to rewrite their municipal code to restrict the use of fines and jail time for petty violations.\n'The agreement also will ensure that the city's stated commitment to refocusing police and municipal court practices on public safety, rather than revenue generation, takes root and will not be undone,' Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, wrote in a letter to Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III.\nThe city had been under federal scrutiny since the August 2014 shooting of unarmed Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson.\nThe killing led to protests and promoted a wave of national scrutiny about police use of force and law enforcement's interactions with minorities.\nWilson was cleared in the shooting, but a federal investigation into the Ferguson police force found patterns of racial bias throughout the city's criminal justice system.\nQuit: Darren Wilson, seen shopping and keeping fit near his Missouri home has left the force but officers told Daily Mail Online that it still has divisions over whether to support him\nFocal point: The headquarters of Ferguson Police Department has been the scene of repeated demonstrations. protesters returned this week and even more are expected for Sunday's anniversary of Brown's death\nA Justice Department report in March found widespread racial bias and also criticized the department for using fines for petty municipal violations as a source of revenue for the city government.\nThe recommended overhaul follows seven months of negotiations and Ferguson officials posted the tentative deal on the city's website last night.\nThey scheduled three public sessions for input from residents and a City Council vote is scheduled for February 9 on the deal, which is likely to be costly for the city.\nFerguson spokesman Jeff Small said the city hasn't calculated its total financial obligations but called them 'significant.'\nFerguson voters will consider two ballot measures in April that would increase property and sales taxes - without which the city expects to resort to layoffs to help plug a $2.8 million budget shortfall.\nSHOCKING RACIALLY CHARGED EMAILS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE US JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORT INTO FURGUSON POLICE DEPARTMENT November 2008: An email stated that President Barack Obama would not be president for very long because 'what black man holds a steady job for four years.'\nMarch 2010: An email mocked African-Americans through speech and stereotypes, using a story involving child support. One line from the email read: 'I be so glad that dis be my last child support payment! Month after month, year after year, all dose payments!'\nApril 2011: An email depicted President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee.\nMay 2011: An email stated: 'An African-American woman in New Orleans was admitted into the hospital for a pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, 'Crimestoppers.'\nJune 2011: An email described a man seeking to obtain 'welfare' for his dogs because they are 'mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English and have no frigging clue who their Daddies are.'\nOctober 2011: An email included a photo of a group of topless women dancing, appearingly tribal, with the caption, 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion.'\nDecember 2011: An email included jokes based on offensive stereotypes about Muslims. *The list above is highlighted emails found in the DOJ's 102-page report on the Ferguson Police Department.\n'We're not just going to negotiate and say, `Boom. This is what you have to live with as a community,'' Small said.\nThe consent decree represents a milestone for a city that attracted national attention after Brown was shot during a street encounter with Wilson.\nA St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Wilson in the shooting and the Justice Department also cleared the officer.\nIt concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense after Brown tried to grab his gun during a struggle through the window of his police vehicle, then came toward him threateningly after briefly running away.\nGupta said 'the entire Ferguson community has reason to be proud' about the deal'.\nShe added that its implementation will 'ensure that police and court services in Ferguson are provided in a manner that fully promotes public safety, respects the fundamental rights of all Ferguson residents, and makes policing in Ferguson safer and more rewarding for officers.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421238/Pelted-bottles-called-Uncle-Tom-forced-wear-flak-jackets-duty-mocked-criminals-say-gonna-shoot-like-Mike-Brown-Ferguson-cops-reveal-year-hell.html"}
