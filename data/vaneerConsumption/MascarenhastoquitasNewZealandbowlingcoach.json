I need to be closer to my family,\" Mascarenhas said when announcing his resignation.\n\"I had an amazing time with the team. It's probably been the best time I've had in cricket, either as a player or as a coach.\"\nHead coach Mike Hesson said he was sorry to be losing the Englishman.\n\"While obviously disappointed, we understand that family comes first and the demands of the international calendar are not always compatible with that,\" he said.\n\"We look forward to having Dimi with us through to the end of the Australian series and wish him well in the future.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3422138/Mascarenhas-quit-New-Zealand-bowling-coach.html"}
