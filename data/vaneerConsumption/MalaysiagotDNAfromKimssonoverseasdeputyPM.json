Airport CCTV footage shows them approaching the victim and apparently smearing his face with a piece of cloth.\nInvestigators are also seeking seven North Korean suspects, four of whom left Malaysia on the day of the murder. Interpol has issued an international arrest warrant for the four men.\nThere are fears Kim Jong-Nam's son Han-Sol could be targeted next\nThe police chief has said he believes they fled to Pyongyang while the other three are hiding in North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\nPyongyang has denounced the investigation as an attempt to smear the secretive regime, insisting that Kim most likely died of a heart attack.\nThe killing has triggered a bitter row between Malaysia and North Korea, which have expelled each other's ambassadors and barred their citizens from leaving.\nKim's wife and children, who were living with him in Macau, went into hiding after the murder. He was known to have at least one son, 21-year-old Kim Han-Sol, who some fear could be targeted next.\nIn what may be the first comments by the family since Kim's death, a young man identifying himself as Han-Sol appeared in a video that circulated last week. The claim was later verified by South Korea's intelligence agency.\nBut he did not reveal his whereabouts or offer to claim his father's body, which was embalmed recently to stop it decomposing as it lies in a morgue in Kuala Lumpur.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4319768/Malaysia-got-DNA-Kims-son-overseas-deputy-PM.html"}
