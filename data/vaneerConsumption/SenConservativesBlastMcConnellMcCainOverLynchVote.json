The Senate vote has been set for Thursday.\nThe letter sent out Wednesday morning slams establishment Republicans like Mitch McConnell and John McCain for playing political games with the Lynch nomination. Lynch has been criticized for her positions, including supporting President Obama’s executive amnesty. “In her confirmation hearings, Lynch could not identify any limits on the president’s executive power and said she believes executive amnesty is legal and constitutional.”\nA call to action provides a list of five GOP Senators who plan to vote to confirm and requests readers to call to request that they instead vote against Lynch. Those Senators are Susan Collins (R-ME), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lindsay Graham (R-SC), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Mark Kirk (R-IL). Breitbart has reported on expected 2016 Presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s pressure to confirm Lynch despite her support for amnesty.\nThe letter also provides insight into the political gamesmanship played by those who, it claims, will vote strategically against, knowing that enough Republican votes will be lodged in favor to confirm.\n“Please don’t be fooled when Senator McConnell votes against the nomination. If he truly opposed Lynch, he would have either blocked her nomination from reaching the floor, gotten 51 Republicans to oppose her, or reversed Harry Reid’s “nuclear option” so the nomination could be filibustered with 41 votes.”\nMcConnell told Breitbart before the landslide 2014 midterm elections that any Holder replacement should commit to putting rule of law over political ideology including executive amnesty. At the same time Senator Jeff Sessions said, “No senator should vote to confirm anyone to this position who does not firmly reject the President’s planned executive amnesty.”\nLong entrenched Arizona Senator John McCain has publicly acknowledged the expectation of a primary challenger. Now the Senator has not so mysteriously broken ranks with close allies Sens. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ). Those two make up half of the Republican Senators that advanced the Lynch nomination out of committee.\nWednesday’s letter asks readers to call McConnell, providing his phone number and instructing callers to ask, “Why he isn’t working to ‘crush’ liberal nominations like he works to ‘crush’ conservative Senate candidates.”\nThe letter then calls out McCain saying, “Don’t be fooled when Senator John McCain (R-AZ) votes against the Lynch nomination. The timing of his opposition is all too convenient.” It continues, “McCain has a record of supporting liberal judges and Executive Branch nominees, including Breyer and Ginsburg for the Supreme Court, and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Eric Holder for cabinet positions.”\nBreitbart’s Matthew Boyle previously reported on McCain’s consistency in portraying a more conservative persona around election time. In his more than three decades in Washington, the five-term Senator showed this persona when he faced a 2010 primary challenger. He ran an infamous campaign ad in which he promised to “build the danged fence.” In five years, the Senator has not made good on that promise. Instead, Boyle points out, McCain focused on efforts “to grant amnesty to illegal aliens through the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” bill last Congress rather than securing the border.”\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/04/22/senate-conservatives-blast-mcconnell-mccain-over-impending-lynch-confirmation/"}
