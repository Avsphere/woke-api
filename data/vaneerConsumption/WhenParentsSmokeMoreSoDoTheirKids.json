The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe more a parent smokes in front of the kids, the more likely those children are to become heavy smokers themselves, a new study finds.\nIt’s clear that smoking addiction can be inherited, but the new study shows there’s more than just a genetic effect. The more time children spend seeing their parents smoke, the more they’ll smoke themselves, it finds.\nDr. Darren Mays of Georgetown University and colleagues interviewed more than 400 kids aged 12 to 17 several times over a five-year period. They asked the teens about how often their parents smoked and also about whether the kids themselves smoked and if so, how much.\nNot surprisingly, teens whose parents were regular smokers were more likely to smoke. But teens whose parents had quit were not any more likely to smoke than the children of nonsmokers.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/when-parents-smoke-more-so-do-their-kids-n101601"}
