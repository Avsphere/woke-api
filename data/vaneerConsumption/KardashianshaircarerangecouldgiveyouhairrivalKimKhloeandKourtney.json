Here's how we got on...\nScroll down for video\nThe Kardashian Beauty range, which just launched in the UK, features tools such as a flat iron, as well as seven styling products. FEMAIL was the UK's first to put the products to the test by creating two of the sisters' signature looks: the loose, glossy 'do and the effortless waves. Jessica Chelsea, 24, from London, left, was treated to a Khloe makeover, right, using the products\nHairstylist Danny applied the £8.69 Twirl Me Curl-Defining Cream-Gel to ensure the curls kept their bounce and hold without drying the hair out\n'The sisters wanted to share their access to luxury formulas with their fans and Kardashian Beauty does just that,' claims exclusive stockist www.cloud10beauty.com.\n'It's a prestige product range with high quality formulas at very accessible prices. Each product has been designed with Kourtney’s, Kim’s and Khloé’s direction, input and guidance.\n'Every product formula has been tested and approved by all three sisters.'\nHoping to put the claims to the test, Jessica Chelsea, 24, from London, who runs CocoaChelsea.com, was treated to a Khloe makeover using the products.\nHair stylist Danny prepped the hair with the £9.94 black seed oil, which is an ingredient Kim has used on her locks for years, and is described as 'a nutrient rich treatment and styling aid that rejuvenates and nourishes hair so it appears strong, thick, smooth and gloriously shiny'.\nDanny then treated Taiba, 28, from London, left, to a style befitting of both Kim and Kourtney, right, who often champion the sleek, glossy 'do\nThe products contain black seed oil, which the sisters have long credited for giving them glossy locks.\nDanny prepped the hair with the £9.95 dry shampoo, which claims to extend the life of your style by eliminating excess oils and impurities that weigh hair down in between washes\nDanny also applied the £8.69 Kardashian Beauty Twirl Me Curl-Defining Cream-Gel to ensure the curls kept their bounce and hold without drying the hair out.\nSpeaking about the look, Danny said: 'I have never heard of black seed oil before but I really like the gloss it gives hair. It smells amazing and isn't too greasy at all. Perhaps it will become the new argan oil.'\nDanny then treated Taiba, 28, from London, to a style befitting of both Kim and Kourtney, who often champion the sleek, glossy 'do.\nHe prepped the hair with the £9.95 dry shampoo, which claims to extend the life of your style by eliminating excess oils and impurities that weigh hair down in between washes, and the dry conditioner.\nThis conditioning spray claims to add shine and moisture to dull or dry hair, leaving it 'gorgeously smooth and touchably soft.'\nIndeed, Speaking to FEMAIL last year, Kim said: 'As far as products, I love the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have.\n'I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.'\nThe launch of the haircare brand in the UK comes after the sisters successfully launched a fashion range with Lipsy, sunglasses range and jewellery collection at Argos\nKardashian-inspired make-up, including the Live Love London contour set, left and Instant Effects Instant lip, right, was used on the shoot\nSpeaking about the rather curious product, Danny said: 'I used the dry conditioner to create body and texture, the hair looks sleek and glamorous. The dry conditioner is really innovative and smells incredible.'\nThe £7.45 brushes were also a hit and thanks to their lightweight material, felt soft on the hair and were easy to use. Less successful was the hairspray, which didn't hold the hair in place for as long as the women had hoped.\nOverall, both ladies and hairstylist were impressed with the range and praised its glossy packaging and reasonable price point.\nLikewise, pro hairstylist Frankie Foye, who has worked with top models like Alessandra Ambrosio and Behati Prinsloo, told FEMAIL: 'I’ll tell you, they got it right. It’s taken pro stylists three or four tries to get their product lines right, and they nailed it out of the gate.'\nThe launch of the haircare brand in the UK comes after the sisters successfully launched a fashion range with Lipsy, sunglasses range and jewellery collection at Argos. It seems it really is all about Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\nPhotography: Jenny Goodall\nMake-up: Live Love London and Instant Effects Instant lip and lash","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3420824/Can-Kardashian-s-haircare-range-glossy-locks-rival-Kim-Khloe-Kourtney.html"}
