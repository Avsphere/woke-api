The most important thing, for me, in doing this book was honesty, I had to be as honest as I possibly could,' said the 67-year-old, who used to be known as the Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner.\n'I told things in this book that my family didn't know I was doing, I didn't even know what I was doing!' she added.\n'It was a long struggle, but it's funny, I tried to keep humor in it because I think humor is extremely important,' she said.\nTrump talk: Caitlyn voiced her displeasure with Trump over his withdrawal of federal guidelines for Title IX by the Obama administration protecting transgender students\n'This is such a marginalised community,' Caitlyn continued, noting the high rate of suicides among trans people.\nJenner admitted that she was largely ignorant of the community until after her transition.\n'I had never even met another person who was trans,' she said, noting that she'd worked hard to learn the appropriate vocabulary.\nUltimate double: Seth congratulated Caitlyn after she pointed out winning the 'ultimate double' of the Olympics and Glamour's Woman of the Year Award\nWhen Meyers called her out for voting for President Donald Trump she said: 'Oh god did I?'\n'Obviously the Republican Party does not do a good job when it comes to equality and the entire LGBT community, the Democrats are better there'.\n'I believe in minimal government,' she continued.\nMade mistakes: Caitlyn admitted making mistakes that angered the transgender community\n'My loyalty is not with Donald Trump…my loyalty is with my community and I will fight for this community,' she added.\n'There are other people within his administration…Jeff Session is one of them, very anti-LGBT…another guy Mark Green, who they're putting in for secretary of the army, has said that trans people have a disease. I don't have a disease,' she explained with a chuckle.\nMeyers asked if Trump had asked her to play golf with him.\nGhost writer: Buzz Bissinger, 62, who ghost wrote the memoir joined Caitlyn on the show\n'Yeah, and I haven't done it because I don't think he wants to get beat by a 67-year-old trans woman, the man has an ego,' she laughed.\nThe book is not written in a linear format, but flips back and forth through time.\n'I want to make it clear this is Caitlyn's book, I'm kind of the midwife, I used my technical skills to put it together,' said Bissinger.\nTalking politics: Seth Meyers asked Caitlyn about voting for Donald Trump\nIn the tome Jenner said that sport, marriage and family life were a 'diversion' from her problems - a comment that infuriated her children.\n'I got in trouble with my family because I said they were a diversion and they were all, 'Oh, so that's why you had us, for a diversion?'' And I go ''No, no no''.'\n'It was a diversion from myself,' she explained.\n'So I'd never have to deal with myself'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4446240/Caitlyn-Jenner-s-ghost-writer-Buzz-Bissinger-disputes-Kris.html"}
