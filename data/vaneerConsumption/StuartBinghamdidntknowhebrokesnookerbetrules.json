One possible yardstick for the punishment coming his way is the fine of Â£5,000 and six-month suspended ban handed to fellow professional Alfie Burden in January for similar offences.\nSpeaking in The Times, Bingham added: 'There have been enquiries going on over the last few weeks. I have used another account to place bets on snooker matches.\n'It is similar to what Alfie Burden did, but I have never bet against myself, and never been involved in any match-fixing or corruption. I did some accumulators, and used someone else's account. It was boredom, really.\n'It looks as if I have got it wrong, it was stupid, and I wasn't aware enough of the rules.\nBingham won snooker's world championship after beating Shaun Murphy in 2015\n'I have fully co-operated with the enquiries and will continue to do so.\n'But basically I did it, I can't change that, and will have to take whatever is coming. We have to be seen to be whiter than white.'\nBingham was a surprise winner of the World Championship in 2015 and is currently ranked third in the world.\nHe won the Welsh Open last month, beating Judd Trump in the final.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-4319328/Stuart-Bingham-didn-t-know-broke-snooker-bet-rules.html"}
