It decided to expand the recall after getting more warranty claims.\nBMW says some front universal joint seals were manufactured wrong and can let water and dirt into the joint. That can cause faster wear and potential failure. The company says in government documents that it has no reports of crashes or injuries.\nBMW will replace the front driveshaft at no cost to owners starting on April 24.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4301184/BMW-adds-134-000-SUVs-2016-driveshaft-recall.html"}
