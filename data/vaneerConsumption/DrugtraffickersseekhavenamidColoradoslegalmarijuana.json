Colorado has the nation's most robust commercial market.\nIn one case, the owner of a skydiving business crammed Colorado marijuana into his planes and flew it to Minnesota, where associates allegedly sold it for millions of dollars in cash. In another, a Denver man was charged with sending more than 100 pot-filled FedEx packages to New York state, where drug dealers divided up the shipment. Twenty other drug traffickers, many from Cuba, were accused of relocating to Colorado to grow marijuana that they sent to Florida, where it can fetch more than double the price in a legal Colorado shop.\nFILE - In this Dec. 31, 2013 file photo, employees tends to marijuana plants at a grow house in Denver. According to law enforcement officials, Colorado¿s legal marijuana marketplace is in some cases serving as cover for a host of illegal drug traffickers who hide their product among the state¿s many legal growing operations, then covertly ship it elsewhere and pocket millions of dollars from its sale. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, file)\nNeighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit in late 2014 seeking to declare Colorado's marijuana legalization unconstitutional, arguing that the move sent a tide of illicit weed across their borders. The Obama administration last month urged the Supreme Court to reject the suit, saying the leakage was not Colorado's fault.\nNo one knows exactly how much pot leaves Colorado. When illegal shipments are seized, it's often impossible to prove where the marijuana was grown. But court documents and interviews with law enforcement officials indicate well-organized traffickers are seeking refuge in the state's flourishing pot industry.\n\"There's no question there's a lot more of this activity than there was two years ago,\" said Colorado's U.S. attorney, John Walsh.\nThe federal government allowed Colorado's experiment on the condition that state officials act to keep marijuana from migrating to places where it is still outlawed and out of the hands of criminal cartels. Federal authorities acknowledge that both things are happening but say that, because the state is trying to keep its industry tightly regulated, there's no reason to end the legal pot trade.\nThe pot industry acknowledges the criminal activity and insists it is doing all it can to keep legally grown weed from crossing state lines. Among other safeguards, Colorado law requires growers to get a license and use a \"seed-to-sale\" tracking system that monitors marijuana plants at every stage.\nMany of the illicit growers come from elsewhere, never obtain a growing license and \"don't even attempt to adhere to the law,\" said Barbra M. Roach, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Denver field division.\nJason Warf, head of the Southern Colorado Cannabis Council, said people are \"coming from out-of-state, buying products from licensed stores and being arrested on their way home.\"\n\"We can't essentially babysit adults and their behavior,\" he said.\nThe Colorado Department of Revenue's marijuana enforcement division cites shops if pot is unaccounted for, but \"after it's sold, we have very little control what happens to the marijuana,\" Director Lewis Koski said.\nPolice agencies seized nearly 2 tons of Colorado marijuana from drivers who had intended to take it to 36 other states in 2014, the year legal pot shops opened, according to the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a federally funded drug task force. By comparison, they seized less than a ton in 2009.\nU.S. postal inspectors seized about 470 pounds of Colorado pot from the mail in 2014, up from 57 pounds in 2010, according to the task force, whose findings are based on voluntary submissions from law enforcement agencies.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420937/Drug-traffickers-seek-haven-amid-Colorados-legal-marijuana.html"}
