The Olympics will play a massive part in helping that.\" pic.twitter.com/UHf1cjHidM — The European Tour (@EuropeanTour) April 26, 2017\nWood, who will defend his title at Wentworth in a month’s time, said: “It’s a good time of year for me to be playing.\n“I’ve played the desert swing and a few events in the States and it’s easy to sort of fall out of the rhythm of playing, so to come out here for the Volvo China Open and the GolfSixes next week (where he will partner Ryder Cup team-mate Andy Sullivan) should be good.\n“I’ve been playing all right but just not really scoring, hence why I need to keep playing. I have had a couple of weeks off since the Masters and practised hard at home, so I am ready for this week.\n“When you have been playing well but not scoring you are eager for Thursday to come and test it out to see if you can post some scores, because I’ve been playing the golf but just not getting it in the hole.”\nMorning visit to the Great Wall for the #VolvoChinaOpen @europeantour Excited to try and defend the 🏆 this week! 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/c3yBtsn0Iy — Haotong Li (@haotong_li) April 25, 2017\nLi Haotong will attempt to defend the title he won in spectacular fashion 12 months ago, when he carded a flawless closing 64 to finish 22 under par and become the second Chinese player to win a European Tour event on home soil, following in the footsteps of 2015 champion Wu Ashun.\n“To be honest, last year I didn’t play very well in the week before the Volvo China Open,” said Li, who missed the cut in the Shenzhen International in 2016 and last week.\n“A lot of people had big expectations and I was disappointed with how I played during the tournament. I wasn’t really sure what to do, so the following week I didn’t look at my phone at all and started to read books every night to take my mind off things and concentrate on my game.\n“It was very calming and I liked the quiet time to myself, which was something very new to me. People were not talking to me all the time and I could just focus on playing golf. Whatever it was, it definitely worked.\n“Winning my maiden European Tour title in China was an incredible feeling, so now I try to stay as relaxed as possible every week, and hopefully it will work out well again this week.\n“I know it’s always tough to play as a defending champion, so I’ll just try to enjoy myself and play my best.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4447494/Chris-Wood-hoping-successful-week-Volvo-China-Open.html"}
