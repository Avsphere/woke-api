It is universally supported by remainer and opposed by #Brexiteers#BrexitBetrayal#Brexit — Ben Harris-Quinney (@B_HQ) July 9, 2018\nMay’s fellow Conservative and Remainer Anna Soubry — who helped launch a cross-party campaign to push for a second referendum — “commended” the Prime Minister “for this plan, and in particular, can I congratulate her for her leadership”, adding that Mrs May was moving in the right direction.\nTory grandee Ken Clarke also “warmly congratulat[ed] the Prime Minister on the progress she made at the weekend at Chequers”, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond tweeted that May’s soft Brexit plan has his “full support”.\nThe PM making important statement in the House, and @theresa_may's plan has my full support. It's a proposal that puts jobs first and protects our nation's prosperity. #gettingthebestdealforBritain — Philip Hammond (@PhilipHammondUK) July 9, 2018\nOther Remainers saw the Chequers Agreement as a foot in the door to either a second referendum, retaining a close union with the EU, or stopping Brexit altogether, with Labour MP Ben Bradshaw MP calling for a vote on the final deal — a second referendum by any other name — and Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alistair Campbell later calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal.\nHowever, campaigners for a clean Brexit told the Prime Minister that the ‘third way’ proposals were a betrayal of Brexit and of the 17.4 million Britons who voted Leave.\nFormer spokesman for Tony Blair @campbellclaret calls for a \"people's vote\" on the final #Brexit deal All of the latest Brexit news here: https://t.co/AxzjKvM2IN pic.twitter.com/q5dsngVO6a — Sky News (@SkyNews) July 9, 2018\nConservative MP Peter Bone said that Tory activists in his constituency of Wellingborough felt “betrayed” and for the first time in ten years refused to go out and campaign for the party.\nAnd Conservative Andrea Jenkyns — who recently resigned as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit — told the House that “within 46 hours of the Prime Minister’s statement, I had received over 300 emails” from her Morley and Outwood constituents, “disheartened, dismayed, and telling me that democracy is dead”.\nWATCH | \"Within 48 hours of the prime minister's statement I received over 300 emails dishearted, dismayed, and telling me that democracy is dead\" @andreajenkyns Support us at https://t.co/ntwXbJeHQw pic.twitter.com/8cPeBAXyyS — Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) July 9, 2018\nJenkyns, like grassroots favourite to lead the party Jacob Rees-Mogg, is ready to vote against the deal if the details prove to be as bad for Brexit as the initial three-page briefing note implies.\nSignificantly, three Brexit-supporting ministers have so far resigned from Mrs May’s Cabinet with David Davis and Steve Baker resigning as Brexit secretary and under-secretary for Department for Exiting the European Union, respectively, on Sunday night and Boris Johnson stepping down as foreign secretary on Monday.\nPoliticians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain. I can only regret that the idea of #Brexit has not left with Davis and Johnson. But…who knows? — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) July 9, 2018\nChairman of the pro-Brexit, conservative think tank the Bow Group Ben Harris-Quinney told Breitbart London: “If you are puzzling over the small print in May’s proposal just look at how happy the Remainers are and how angry the Brexiteers are.\n“Anna Soubry and Nicholas Soames praising May tells the story better than anyone else could.\n“This is a soft Brexit deal to leave the constraints of the EU in name only. Boris Johnson, David Davis, and Steve Baker were right to resign and I caution any Brexiteer who supports it, they will be trading favour with a short-term Government over the long-term support of their base.”\n.@BorisJohnson has not only done the right thing, he has set clear blue water between him and other so called #Brexiteers who support a soft #Brexit . He is now in pole position to be the next leader of the @Conservatives and form a #Brexiteer government. — Bow Group (@bowgroup) July 9, 2018","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/07/09/remainers-congratulate-may-brexit-betrayal/"}
