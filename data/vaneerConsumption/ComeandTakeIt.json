In fact, gun owners rallied near Sacramento’s Cesar Chavez Plaza on Saturday morning to to say the new controls simply turn “law-abiding citizens into criminals.”\nFor that reason, they have no plans to obey.\nAccording to the Sacramento Bee, the protesters held banners which proclaimed, “WE WILL NOT COMPLY.”\nCorey Gwathney helped organize the rally. He said, “They’re infringing on our rights, and we’re not going to stand for that.”\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
