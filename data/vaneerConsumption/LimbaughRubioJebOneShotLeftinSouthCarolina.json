Marco Rubio (R-FL) and former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL).\nAccording to Limbaugh, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is looking to finish everyone off in South Carolina, despite having a second-place finish in Iowa and the upcoming SEC primary. But could be the last stand for both Bush and Rubio.\n“Marco Rubio — you know, he’s got one shot left here, South Carolina. Jeb Bush, one shot left here. Trump wants to wipe everybody out in South Carolina. Trump is running around saying, if he wins this, it’s over. There is no way. He’s gonna run the table. Forgetting Iowa. He’s gonna run the table. ‘If I take ’em all out here, there’s nowhere else.’ Now, he’s forgetting about the SEC Primary, Super Tuesday on March 1. But again, he’s trying to create this impression of ineffective.”\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/02/11/limbaugh-rubio-jeb-one-shot-left-in-south-carolina/"}
