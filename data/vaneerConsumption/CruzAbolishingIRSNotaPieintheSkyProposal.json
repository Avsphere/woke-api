Ted Cruz (R-TX), a candidate for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, insisted that his tax plan that would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, isn’t a “pie in the sky” proposal, as FBN host Stuart Varney suggested it was.\n“Well, you know it’s interesting,” he said. “If you go back to 1981 when Ronald Reagan was elected president, he wanted to cut the top marginal tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. Every observer said that’s pie in the sky, that will never happen and especially that will never happen with a Democratic House of Representatives and Tip O’Neill as speaker of the House.”\n“And what Reagan did is he took the case to the American people and he made the case that with economic growth, we can turn this country around,” he continued. “And we went from the stagflation, the misery and malaise of the Carter years to the seven fat years, to the booming Reagan growth. My tax plan, a simple flat tax is designed to do the same thing and we’re going to do the same thing by taking it to the American people by coming out of this election with a mandate from the people.”\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/04/cruz-abolishing-irs-not-a-pie-in-the-sky-proposal/"}
