DeKalb’s fellow core metro Atlanta counties Cobb and Gwinnett each ranked in top 10, but DeKalb ranked 23rd of Georgia’s 159 counties, one spot ahead of Fulton.\nFactors considered in the study released this week include length and quality of life, as well as, smoking, obesity and the availability of medical care.\nIn environment, DeKalb was 92nd, a rank influenced by air pollution and commuting concerns.\nIn length of life, DeKalb was 17th of 159.\nIn terms of health care, which includes costs and the number of uninsured people, DeKalb placed 7th.\nSparsely-populated Quitman County in southwest Georgia was the least healthy county according to the study.\nRead the full 2017 County Health Rankings report here.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/how-healthy-dekalb-this-study-ranks-all-georgia-counties/7oRAVzVxKuYZUGRPdsrEzJ/"}
