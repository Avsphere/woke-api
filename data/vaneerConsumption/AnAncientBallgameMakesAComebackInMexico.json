The Olmecs left behind their massive, carved stone heads, including one that looks a lot like B.J. Leiderman, who writes our theme music. The Mayas built ornate palaces in jungles. The Aztecs built a floating metropolis where Mexico City sits today. And across the centuries, these unique civilizations shared a common tradition - the ball game known as ulama. James Fredrick brings us the story of where this ancient ball game is today.\nJAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: I'm just a stone's throw from a big bus terminal and mall in a working-class Mexico City neighborhood.\n(SOUNDBITE OF CONCH SHELL HORN)\nFREDRICK: An echoing conch shell horn, thundering drums - it feels a bit like I might be back in pre-Hispanic Mexico. Eight wiry athletes with simple, leather wraps around their waists dash around a court barefoot, volleying a ball back and forth using only their hip bones.\nUNIDENTIFIED PLAYERS: (Speaking in foreign language).\nFREDRICK: This is ulama, the game that reigned supreme in pre-Hispanic times. Today, it's being revived at this brand-new court in Mexico City, says coach Emmanuel Kalakot.\nEMMANUEL KALAKOT: (Speaking Spanish).\nFREDRICK: \"It's not so much about returning to a moment that once was,\" he says. \"But we want to take something that was great in its time and make it great again in a new, contemporary way.\"\nThe basic goal of ulama is to hit the ball past the opponent's back line and keep the ball from crossing your own. The players move around the court deftly, either hopping slightly or lowering themselves onto one arm to hit the ball squarely at the hip. They make it look effortless and fun. So I decide to give it a whirl. Giovanni Israel, who's been playing for about two years, offers to show me the basics.\nGIOVANNI ISRAEL: (Speaking Spanish).\nFREDRICK: He demonstrates the footwork, a little step to turn sideways, hip first, and then a little flick of the hips as the ball comes. Being kind to me as a beginner, Giovanni brings me a small practice ball and bounces it towards me.\nISRAEL: (Speaking Spanish).\nFREDRICK: So I've hit the ball a couple of times. It's small, so it doesn't hurt that much. But, you know, hitting off of my hip bone, it can just shoot off in any direction. And I don't feel like I have any control over it.\nISRAEL: (Speaking Spanish).\nFREDRICK: Precision is key. Playing with the official nine-pound, solid, rubber ball, a blow to the thigh gives you a dead leg. Hit above the hip, and it could knock the wind out of you or even fracture a rib. Learning ulama comes with a lot of bruising.\nMANUEL AGUILAR: From our studies, it looks like the game was originally ritual, OK? It was a religious activity.\nFREDRICK: That's Dr. Manuel Aguilar from California State University of Los Angeles - probably the world's leading authority on ulama. He says there was no single, true form of the game across Mesoamerica. It constantly evolved. One version looked like field hockey. Others were closer to soccer. By the time the Aztecs were playing it, Aguilar says gambling was common. And...\nAGUILAR: Some people even bet their own life of becoming slaves if they lose.\nFREDRICK: Ulama survived the Spanish conquest. But by the 20th century, it was at risk of disappearing. Dr. Aguilar is encouraged by efforts to preserve the sport, like this new Mexico City court.\nAGUILAR: The oldest ball court - that is dated about 1,400 B.C. So if the game disappears, there could be the death of a 3,500-years-old sport.\nKAREN FLORES: (Speaking in foreign language).\nFREDRICK: Karen Flores' presence at the Mexico City ulama court suggests a new generation is carrying it in the 21st century. The 22-year-old medical student was told years ago not to play ulama - that historically, only men played.\nFLORES: (Speaking Spanish).\nFREDRICK: She says when she was young, she'd secretly practice hitting a soccer ball against the wall with her hip. She was nervous her first days practicing with men. But nowadays, Karen darts around aggressively and doesn't miss a step. Especially with Karen on the court, this version of ulama probably doesn't look exactly like it did in Aztec times. But evolution and change is at the heart of this ancient sport.

e mazo, a game played with clubs (mazos), kind of like field hockey. (Mexican immigrants from the state of Oaxaca have even brought a variation of that one, pelota mixteca, to California).\nBut the hip version is the one played in Mexico City. The basic point is to hit the ball past the other team or force them into an error of not being able to volley the ball back. If you hit the ball past the other team's backline (called chichis by experts; a word that's also used as slang for various parts of a woman's body, depending on the country), you get a point. If the other team fails to hit the ball past the midline — known as the analco — you also get a point. The first team to score 8 points wins. Easy, right?\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images\nBut as Aguilar explains, scoring is where ulama feels like it's from another world. It doesn't follow linear scoring, like almost every popular sport. Aguilar says it's almost like Chutes and Ladders.\n\"The scoring is what makes the game so brutal, because if you lose a point when you are at a certain score, you start back again at zero,\" he says.\nThere are no ties in ulama, so if team A is winning 1-0 and then team B scores a point, the scores flips, with team A losing its point and team B taking a 1-0 lead. Between certain numbers like 2 and 3, you reach a transitional state called urria, where your team is liable to lose all your points if you concede a score. Ulama is won only with impressive rallies and scoring streaks.\n(This explanation is admittedly lacking, but, in fairness, Aguilar says it took him and his team months to fully understand scoring.)\nNeedless to say, this complex scoring means it's very hard to reach 8 points, turning ulama into a brutal game of endurance. Some ancient matches are said to have lasted more than a week, and strategy was often based on simply wearing down or injuring opponents.\nAguilar says that small towns and families have preserved various ulama traditions, for many years after indigenous communities were ravaged across the region. But in the 20th century, experts worried the game would go extinct, even as tourist attractions like the Xcaret theme park near Cancún tried to promote it.\nThat's why coach Kalakot sees this new court as an opportunity for more than just recreation.\n\"We won't just be teaching the rules and how to play,\" he says. \"We also want players to discover the culture and history and values passed down by the game.\"\nBut the presence of players like Karen Flores suggests ulama is coming into the 21st century.\n\"When I was younger, I saw it being played and I wanted to do it too but the people around me said it wasn't for women, that it could make me infertile,\" she says.\nBut Flores insisted, practicing hitting a soccer ball off her hip against a wall in secret. On the court today, she doesn't miss a step among the men.\nEspecially with a woman like Flores leading the way, this 21st century version of ulama probably doesn't look like it did in Aztec times. But if there's one consistency to the history of the game, it's that it has always been evolving.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/16/646756260/an-ancient-ballgame-makes-a-comeback-in-mexico"}
