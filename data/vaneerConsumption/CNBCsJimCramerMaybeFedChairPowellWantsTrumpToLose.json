The Fed has hiked rates three times this year and is widely expected to hike rates again at its December meeting. The Fed’s projections show central bankers expect to keep raising rates in 2019.\nOn Tuesday, Cramer once again said the Fed should “pause” its hikes after December.\nTrump has frequently voiced his disapproval of the Fed’s policy, saying that the Fed’s policy was working against his administration’s attempt to boost economic growth.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2018/10/30/cnbcs-jim-cramer-maybe-fed-chair-powell-wants-trump-to-lose/amp/"}
