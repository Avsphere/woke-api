[As Amber and Kanye dated].\n'And, by the way, we recall meeting your wife on her back.'\nTit for tat: As part of her Hot Topics segment, the host brought up Kanye's comment that Wiz 'let a stripper trap' him but while defending Amber from so-called 's**t shaming', she did the same to Kim\nWild, wild West: This all started after Kanye (seen here earlier this month) unleashed a tirade at Wiz (pictured with Amber in 2014) on Twitter on Wednesday\nThe talk show host was, of course, talking about Kim's sex tape with Ray J which was released in 2007 and put Kim in the pop cultural map.\nBut Wendy was not done there, inferring that Kanye is gay as Amber slammed in him in a rather crude comment referring to a sex act.\nAmber wrote in Twitter during the epic social media battle: 'Are you mad I'm not around to play in ur a**hole?'\nVery revealing: Wendy was not done there, inferring that Kanye is gay as Amber slammed in him in a rather crude comment referring to a sex act\nClaims marriage is fake: The host said to Kim, 'I'm embarrassed for Kim Kardashian. I'm not even going to call you West because clearly that is not a real marriage'\nWendy, who was previously suspended from her radio job for creating a list of rappers she thought were gay, said Kim should be embarrassed.\nAs her audience screamed and laughed, she said: 'I was telling you I was wasn't feeling so well this morning. I wasn't going to come to work but I realized this whole story had to be told as I'm the OG [original gangster] in this whole booty war.\n'I'm not going to say anything about Kanye, what people do behind closed doors is their own business.\nWould not let up: Despite saying she would not talk about it, Wendy continued to insinuate that Kim and Kanye's relationship was fraudulent and questioned his sexuality\n'[But] I'm embarrassed for Kim Kardashian. I'm not even going to call you West because clearly that is not a real marriage.\n'Any time a man is fighting with another man and bringing up his ex, like why is Kanye still talking about Amber, what kind of respect, or lack there of, does he have about his new son, Saint, and his daughter?'\nDespite saying she would not talk about it, Wendy continued to insinuate that Kim and Kanye's relationship was fraudulent and questioned his sexuality.\nHave some respect: The star said the rapper needed to think of his family, 'Any time a man is fighting with another man and bringing up his ex... what kind of respect, or lack there of, does he have'\n'I'm embarrassed for Kim but, Kim, I think you're more into the image of what it looks like to be married to what you think is a man than anything else. I'm embarrassed for you. This is shameful. That's number one.\n'And, number two, oh, gosh, you know what I'm exhausted by? I'm exhausted because anybody who knows me from radio knows since 1990 I have been talking to you all about what goes on allegedly behind some men's [doors] and I have been suspended without pay, I've been left for dead on the turnpike, you all have thrown tomatoes at me.\n'This is nothing but the same broken record that Wendy has been talking about since forever. No judgment, just saying.'\n'It shows what type of person he is! Wendy's comments come as Amber (pictured last year with Sebastian) fired back again at ex Kanye on the Allegedly podcast\nMaking it clear: Amber Rose said about the rapper (seen here Wednesday), 'Listen don't talk about my kid, that's all I got to say, don't talk about my baby. I wouldn't have said anything if it was just between him and Wiz'\nWendy's comments come as Amber also responded to her ex-boyfriend Kanye's comments about her and her son, whom Kanye even said he 'owned'.\nOn Wednesday, the 32-year-old pre-recorded an interview with Allegedly podcast - a preview of which was obtained by TMZ - and said:'I would never talk about kids in an argument, it just shows what type of person he is.\n'Even him saying things about my son I still didn't say anything about his kids, they are innocent babies, you don't talk about a baby, ever, ever. That just shows how f**king ridiculous he is.\nNot shocked: The 32-year-old (pictured earlier this month) said she was not shocked her ex thought it was alright to drag her child into a twitter fight as 'he is a f**king clown'\nTaking the high road: The model said she would never speak about his children with Kim Kardashian, North (pictured November) and Saint\nNever forget: The star (seen here last month) said children should never be used as targets, 'they are innocent babies, you don't talk about a baby, ever, ever'\n'The crazy thing is he came out with a song last week saying I had my son for a meal ticket and I didn't even say anything, I was just like ''he's a corn ball and I'm not saying s**t.''\n'Listen don't talk about my kid, that's all I got to say, don't talk about my baby. I wouldn't have said anything if it was just between him and Wiz, that's two grown men hashing it out.\n'Hashing it out that's their business, I would have kept it cute and minded my own business but don't bring in my baby, that's so corny.'\n'F**k Kanye!': Wiz did his best to stay calm and play nice on social media as his fellow rapper ranted on and on but he made sure to name check Kanye when he stepped out on stage in Argentina\nAsked if she was surprised Kanye decided to take his fight with Wiz to such a personal level and spoke about her son - who turns three next month - Amber responded: 'No because I know him, I know he is a f**king clown, I know him.'\nAnd she certainly does because, as Amber reminded Kanye, they dated from 2008 till 2010.\n'He gets on the internet today and says ''a stripper trapped you Wiz'' but like you took me around the world, we dated for like two years but you're talking s**t about Wiz and my baby.'\nReminder: Amber pointed out that while Kanye attacked her and her estranged husband Wiz saying a he had been trapped by a stripper, Amber and the now Mr Kim Kardashian dated for two years (pictured in 2009)\nAs she did this her estranged husband Wiz made sure to name check Kanye when he stepped out on stage in Argentina.\nWiz kicked off his song Taylor Gang by saying: 'You just wanna write s**t up? You just wanna talk s**t on the internet, huh?'\nThen in half way through the track, as captured in a video by fan Nahu Marin, the 28-year-old yells: 'F**k Kanye!'\nThe feud began when Kanye announced he changed the name of his upcoming album to Waves, which Wiz took umbrage to as he felt it disrespected the legacy of rapper Max B, who was the founder of the Wave sound. He is currently serving 75 years in prison for a deadly armed robbery.\nEpic: The 38-year-old rapper went on an epic Twitter rant as he took aim at Amber, Wiz's child, his rapping style but not his skinny jeans\nWave and Wavy in Max B's world means influential or cool leading many to believe Kanye lifted the name on purpose - including Wiz.\nWhile Kanye let Wiz's thoughts on the title initially slide after the See You again rapper tweeted something with 'KK,' in it, Kanye thought he was talking about Kim Kardashian and unleashed - despite it actually being a reference to marijuana.\nIn true Kanye style, he came up with 17 reasons why Wiz needs to know his place, including insulting Amber; claiming to own their son Sebastian as well as accusing him of stealing his style from rapper and Kanye protege Kid Cudi.\nRegret? After the string of tweets, Kanye posted much more positive messages and said he was sad about what had occurred\nClarification: Kanye did admit that everything involving 'KK' was a misunderstanding and that it was actually a reference to marijuana\nKanye did however, praise Wiz for his ability to rock skinny jeans whilst claiming to have blazed the fashion path for the slender rapper to do so.\nKanye's epic rant aimed at Wiz including strong words like: 'You let a stripper trap you.'\n'I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years [making reference to his big hit Gold Digger].\n'You wouldn’t have a child if it wasn’t for me. Your own Waves? I own your child!'\nLow blow: Kanye wrote 'you own waves ??? I own your child !!!' about the couple's little boy, who is three next month (seen here last month)\nBut he threw in a few compliments too in the bizarre outburst, saying: 'I think you dress cool I wish I was skinny and tall... Maybe I couldn’t be skinny and tall but I’ll settle for being the greatest artist of all time as a consolation.'\nBut then Kanye took the credit, noting: 'I am your OG and I will be respected as such. I made it so we could wear tight jeans.'\nIt seemed as if Kanye finally got the message as he deleted the string of tweets because it was all about 'positive energy.'\nInteresting initials: Wiz mentioned 'kk' and it seemed to set Kanye off as he thought it was a reference to his wife Kim Kardashian\nExplanation: Wiz did not respond very much during Kanye's epic rant but he did explain what 'kk' meant\nMeanwhile the man over whom the entire argument started - Max B - wasn't taking any sides.\nHis Twitter account posted on on Thursday: 'Im truly flattered by all the emulations. Thnks for the love&support. Lets stay positive.'\nHe finished it with a link to the petition to see him freed from prison.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3421637/We-met-wife-Wendy-Williams-takes-aim-Kim-Kardashian-s-sex-tape-past-wades-Kanye-West-Amber-Rose-battle-insinuates-rapper-gay.html"}
