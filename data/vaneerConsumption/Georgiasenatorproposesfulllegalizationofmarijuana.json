Curt Thompson, D-Norcross, filed the joint proposals Monday for consideration by the state Legislature next year. The legislative session starts Jan. 12.\nThompsonâ€™s Senate Bill 7 would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana of up to two ounces for specific debilitating medical conditions and its use would be strictly regulated by the state.\nAdditionally, Senate Resolution 6 is a proposed amendment to the state constitution. Requiring voter approval, it would legalize, regulate and tax the sale of retail marijuana. Tax revenue from the sale of marijuana would be constitutionally earmarked for education and transportation infrastructure.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-senator-proposes-full-legalization-marijuana/ueoPcAo5Yktq1xT1OMaVFM/"}
