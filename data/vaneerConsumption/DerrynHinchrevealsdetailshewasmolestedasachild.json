Then he'd made a connection and he came into the room where my brother and I were sharing,' Hinch continued.\n'I'm in my pyjamas standing there alongside my bed, and my brother was asleep.'\nHinch claimed the family friend then touched him inappropriately and performed a sex act on him.\n'I don't recall how long it went for, but my brother started to move like he was waking up and the guy ran out of the room. I climbed back into bed, petrified,' he said.\nThe journalist-turned-politician spoke out about the sexual abuse he endured as a child in 1953 as he opened up to Julia Zemiro (right) on ABC's Home Delivery\nHis brother then asked him what had happened but Hinch abruptly responded: 'Nothing!' And just moments later, he cried: 'I want my mummy'.\nWhen his mother rushed into their bedroom, a young Hinch demanded: 'I want my crown back'.\n'I didn't want this man to have my Queen Elizabeth's crown,' he recalled.\n'And mum started giving me a lecture, saying 'no, you made a contract, you made a decision, you've got to understand that and grow up'.'\nBut half way through her lecture, his brother interjected, saying \"mum, that man did something to Derryn\". And then all hell broke loose.'\nMany years later, Hinch asked his parents why they never pressed charges against the man after the incident was left unresolved.\nThe 73-year-old Senator recalled the horrific moment he was sexually abused at the hands of a family friend when he was just nine years old\nHinch said speaking to victims of child sex abuse when he worked as a journalist encouraged him to seek justice\n'They said \"well we didn't want you to have to go through it, we didn't want you to go to court... We just thought it was best for you\". But I said \"well mum, he probably went off to some other town and did it to some other kid\".'\nThe veteran broadcaster has been famously known for his strong stance against paedophiles that has led him to prison for breaching court orders after naming child sex offenders.\nBut Hinch insists his childhood trauma did not influence his crusade.\n'I didn't feel affected by it and it didn't do me harm. I thought if I come out and say that, it'll almost sound encouraging to molesters,' he said.\n'I'm not trying to hide it but it didn't affect me, and it didn't cause me to become this crusader.'\nHowever, Hinch said speaking to victims of child sex abuse when he worked as a journalist encouraged him to seek justice.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319198/Derryn-Hinch-reveals-details-molested-child.html"}
