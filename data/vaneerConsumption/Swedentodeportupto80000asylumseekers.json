Despite the bitter winter cold and rough seas, tens of thousands of men, women and children fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands continue to risk their lives to make the relatively short but dangerous journey from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands, seeking a better future in Europe.

Harju adds: \"That rate could of course change.\"\nGermany and Sweden were the top destinations for asylum-seekers in Europe last year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420472/Sweden-deport-80-000-asylum-seekers.html"}
