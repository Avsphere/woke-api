The Oregonian reports that a 17-year-old was shot in the back and another person, a female, was shot in the chest. The newspaper did not give specifics on the third victim.\nPortland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson said the suspect fled the scene and that the victims, believed to be students, ran back to the school for help.\nThe Associated Press says parents were summoned to the school.\nKATU says that Simpson did not detail the extent of the injuries of the victims but that they were \"alive and breathing when they were taken to Legacy Emanuel Hospital.\"\nAP reports that \"officers don't know whether the shooter was alone or with others, but Simpson says preliminary information suggests it's gang-related.\"\nThe wire service describes Rosemary Anderson as \"an alternative school that serves at-risk students who were expelled or dropped out, are homeless or are single parents.\"\nIn June, an Oregon high school student killed one student before turning the gun on himself.\nAs we reported at the time, the shooter, Jared Padgett, 15, was armed with an \"AR-15-type\" rifle, a semi-automatic handgun, a large knife and several magazines of ammunition.","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/12/12/370393999/3-wounded-in-shooting-outside-portland-high-school"}
