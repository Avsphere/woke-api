In preparation for Dubai Expo 2020, this world class city has multi-million dollar development plans for even more jaw-dropping sights.

They don't have the world's tallest building, but they do have the world's tallest hotel, the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong (which is not only complete but you can sleep in it). When you're not napping in the clouds, you'll find that Hong Kong's luxury boutiques, busy street markets, bustling nightlife, and world-class dining easily rival any other city's amenities.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-not-to-travel-in-2017-2016-12"}
