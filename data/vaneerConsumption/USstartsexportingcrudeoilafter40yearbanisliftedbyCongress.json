The Republicans agreed to allow unprecedented tax incentives for wind and solar power as a compromise with the Democrats, who are in the large part against any increase in drilling.\nThe Senate, on a 65-33 vote, approved lifting the ban and providing five-year extensions of tax breaks to boost renewable energy development as part of a $1.8trillion government spending and tax relief bill that President Barack Obama quickly signed into law.\nDemocrats who backed the deal asserted that its provisions encouraging renewable energy were important for combating global climate change.\nOpponents of lifting the export ban said the action would harm the environment and could lead to an increase in fiery derailments of crude-carrying trains.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423403/U-S-starts-exporting-crude-oil-40-year-ban-lifted-Congress.html"}
