It had streets (First through Sixth) crossed by avenues (Forest, Central, Atlanta) and lots for $25, or $2.50 a month, no interest, according to a 1970 article in The Eagle publication.\n“Come out and go with us,” a developer’s ad for property invited. “FREE train ride.”\nBut Montreal’s ride ended soon thereafter.\nAccording to the Tucker Historical Society, it faded like other communities along the railroad line, such as Gloster, Luxomni, Braden, Wallace and Amour.\nThough the developer boasted that 800 lots were sold and a store and post office sprung up, apparently it wasn’t enough to sustain the town.\nMost of the roads remained unpaved.\nA schoolhouse burned and was never replaced.\nAccording to the historical society, Montreal remained “part of the local identity” for more than 20 years.\nBut eventually, the lots returned to farmland and the area would have to wait decades for development to come, though the name Montreal never returned.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/how-did-dekalb-town-disappear/rcNT90w2IfmgFg9j2eI3BM/"}
