At the movies. In the mall. At the grocery store. In our church. In our office. In our school.” And Dvorak says this “collective PTSD” is not without merit, as there are so many guns in America, and the owners of those guns point to “a constitutional amendment written in 1791, at a time when arms were cartoonish muskets or flintlock pistols that made one, harum-scarum shot, then had to be reloaded.”\nDvorak then suggested we combine our Fourth of July celebrations with a thorough examination of the gun culture we have maintained for 224 years. She made no mention of the fact that the three mass shooting examples she provided—the DC Navy Yard, Sandy Hook, and the Charleston church—all took place in gun free zones.\nAll three incidents were in areas with 100 percent gun control, which criminals readily ignored.\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
