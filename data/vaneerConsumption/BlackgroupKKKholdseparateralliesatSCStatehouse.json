Later, the North Carolina-based Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally on the opposite side of the building to protest the flag's removal.\nSeveral people carried the Confederate flag along the margin of the crowd at the black educators rally. About 40 members of the KKK marched up the Capitol steps and waved flags. Many in the crowd jeered.\nTwo men who were involved in a scuffle were led away by police.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/jul/18/black-group-kkk-hold-separate-rallies-sc-statehous/"}
