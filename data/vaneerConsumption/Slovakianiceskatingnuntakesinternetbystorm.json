It was too hilarious for words, but also strange at the same time.\n'I felt so... I don't even know how to describe that feeling. And what really what touched me the most was that they were all so happy.\n'I could feel the happiness that shone from them. They appreciated the moment, ice skating around each other. And they were all really pretty!\nSister Maria was revealed to have been a junior champion skater in her youth and still practices today\n'One of the nuns started figure skating. It was so nice and suddenly my little sister asked her to teach her some skating skills too.'\nSister Maria told Christian news website Zasvateny Zivot: 'I did not like ice skating races, but I liked to perform. My joy was in the audience.'\nShe said she took her holy orders a decade ago after a difficult end to a love affair, but still finds time for her favourite hobby around her spiritual duties.\nShe said: 'I used to hold religious meetings with ice hockey players. I spoke to them about Jesus and supported them.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393819/Slovakian-ice-skating-nun-takes-internet-storm.html"}
