He now has passed Marshall Faulk, Jim Brown and Dorsett this season.\nHowever, Peterson entered the day 545 yards behind Eric Dickerson for eighth place on the all-time list. Peterson had rushed for 438 yards in the first six games, so he could surpass Dickerson this year if he stays healthy.\nPeterson has posted four games with at least 90 yards rushing this season -- all in Redskins victories.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/adrian-peterson-passes-tony-dorsett-nfls-time-rusher/story?id=58810253"}
