Black Lives Matter, they were treading the waters of insulting me,” he said in reference to being attacked for earlier statements he made questioning the anti-police group’s priorities.\n“It starts with us. It’s been easy to blame other people for stuff like that and point the finger. But black lives should matter to black” people, the rapper said in September.\n“I was just saying that we should love ourselves more,” Wale said Wednesday on The Breakfast Club. He also assailed some light-skin black people who publicly shame dark-skin black people and said, “You never see a white person making fun of a tanned white person.”\n“I just want black people to care about black people more,” he said.\nWale also ripped Raven-Symoné for her recent comments in which the The View co-host said she would not hire people with “ghetto” names.\n“You got d*ckheads like Raven-Symoné making fun of [names like] ‘Watermelonisha.'” Wale said. “If you weren’t lucky enough to be on the Cosby Show, you would be struggling to get a job too,” with a name like Raven-Symoné. “And you looking down on your own people because of their name?”\nWale, whose name is Olubowale Victor Akintimehin, says he “had to go through stuff” because of his name growing up.\nThe Grammy Award-nominated rapper also believes that “it’s an advantage to be gay in this country right now.”\nWale’s also no fan of “Uncle Sam.” He admonished the idea of having to pay high taxes and made arguments similar to those one might hear from a proponent of small government.\nWatch Wale’s rant below:","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/10/22/rapper-wale-blasts-black-lives-matter-raven-symone-for-demeaning-black-culture/"}
