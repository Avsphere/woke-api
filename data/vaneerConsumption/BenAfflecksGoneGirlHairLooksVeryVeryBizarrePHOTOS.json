The film's posters have been on point and the trailers are a perfect mix of sinister and innocence. Fans haven't even been able to complain about Ben Affleck's portrayal of Nick Dunne. But on Thursday, Entertainment Weekly 's second Gone Girl cover was revealed and there's something wildly wrong (well maybe not wrong, but it's distracting as hell): Ben Affleck's hair.\nNow, this has nothing to do with how Flynn physically describes Nick Dunne in the novel, but more with the fact that I just can't stop staring at it. Is it a photoshop nightmare? Did someone take black shellac and put it over Affleck's hair before the photo shoot? Or is that one of those plastic hair pieces you can buy for your Halloween costume? Honestly, I have no freaking idea what the explanation is, but what I do know is that it does not look anything like Affleck's real hair or his hair in either Gone Girl trailer or even on the first of EW 's Gone Girl covers back in January.\nApparently, the real mystery here isn't who killed Rosamund Pike's Amy Dunne, but what the heck happened to Affleck's hair on this cover.\nBecause it really looks like these 5 things:\nA Brain\nIf your brain were black and on the outside of your head, that's what it'd look like.\nThis Kim Kardashian: Hollywood Hairstyle\nMinus the ponytail, obviously.\nThese Trees\nExcept a lot less natural.\nMr. Potato Head's Hairpiece\nHopefully Affleck's hairpiece is removable, too.\nThe Human Ken Doll Justin Jedlica's Hair\nDid they EW give Ben Affleck a head transplant for this photoshoot?\nImages: Entertainment Weekly, Wikimedia Commons, Christine DiStasio, gordon_robertson/Flickr, Amazon, JustinJedlica/Instagram","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35819-ben-afflecks-gone-girl-hair-looks-very-very-bizarre-photos"}
