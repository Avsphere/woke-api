Transfers are not awarded on a first-come-first-served basis.\nIf there are too many applicants for a particular school, there will be a lottery to determine who may transfer. Graduating fifth and eighth grade students who have transferred in the past must reapply, but they will be given first priority in lotteries in order to remain in their new school feeder pattern. Siblings of current choice students are given the next highest priority.\nClick here to view the number of available seats in each grade level at each school.\nClick here to apply.\nFor those without computer access, a kiosk is available in the lobby of the CCSD Central Offices at 514 Glover Street, Marietta, weekdays from 8a.m.-4:30p.m.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/cobb-now-accepting-school-choice-applications/8SFfUU0YuoLQFq6Y19C2BK/"}
