Jones, Jr, 52, who received a lethal injection after delivering a two-minute final statement - during which he apologized at length to his victim's daughter.\nNew photos show Jones' sister Lynn Scott weeping over a photo of the inmate just outside the prison hours before he was put to death on Monday night.\nHis daughter Gina Grimm was also pictured outside the Varner unit being consoled by anti-death penalty activists, who showed up to protest the executions of Jones and one other on Monday.\nJones' family members were joined by individuals from the Episcopal church, who were there to offer their condolences to Jones as well as to protest the use of the death penalty in the United States.\nScroll down for video\nJack Jones (left) was put to death at the Cummins Unit at 7.20pm on Monday.

Put to death April 21. Execution started 11.44pm. Pronounced dead 11.56pm Total time: 12 minutes 2) Jack Jones Jr. Put to death April 24. Execution started 7.06pm.

He gave no final words, and his victims' family declined to give a statement.\nThere were about 25 people in the room to witness his death, according to KARK reporter Jessi Turnure.\nJones was sentenced to death for the 1995 attack and the brutal beating of then 11-year-old Lacy. He strangled the mother with the cord to a coffee pot.\nBefore Jones was executed, he ate a last meal of of fried chicken, potato logs with tartar sauce, beef jerky bites, three candy bars, a chocolate milkshake and fruit punch.\nJack H.
