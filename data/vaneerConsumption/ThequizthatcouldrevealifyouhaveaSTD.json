Answers are evaluated on a scale of zero to 10 - and the higher the number, the higher the risk\nDr Charlotte Gaydos, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases, said: ‘We test a lot of people who are not infected, and although a tool like this might not predict every single case, we think it can be helpful in rapidly predicting the likelihood of an STI for physicians and patients.’\nThe quiz was first developed to supplement a home STD testing kit campaign for teens.\nScientists made the quiz available to nearly 3,200 people age 14 and over, who are from Maryland and Washington, D.C.\nPeople who accessed the STD testing kit website were invited to take a mailed or online risk quiz, in addition to ordering a free home kit.\nNearly half of those invited to take the quiz took it – 830 females and 550 males, with an average age of 20 to 24 years old.\nThe quizzes were scored on a scale of zero to 10.\nSEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES STDs are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. These diseases include chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, human papillomavirus, syphilis and HIV. You can develop an STD by having vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who has a STD. Some STDs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact – so you don’t have to have full-on sex to be infected. There are nearly 20 million new STD cases each year in the US. Nearly half of these diseases are in people between the ages of 15 and 24. The best way to protect against STDs is abstinence. But if you are going to have sex, you and your partner should be tested beforehand and/or use condoms. If you are in a monogamous sexual relationship - and STD free - you can also pursue other birth control options. Many STDs don’t have any symptoms – so getting tested is vital. You can be tested at a doctors office or free clinic. Source: CDC\nFemale participants were considered to be ‘high risk’ if they scored between eight to 10 points.\nConversely, men were ‘high risk’ at seven to 10 points.\n‘Medium risk’ fell in the five to seven point range for women, and three to six for men.\nBut if women scored zero to four points, and men scored zero to two, they were considered to be ‘low risk.’\nWomen were scored differently than men because ‘females tend to have higher rates’ of STDs than men, according to the researchers.\nScientists suspected that the higher the score, the more likely a respondent would be to test positive for a STD using the home testing kit.\nAll of the questions were weighted differently based on evidence associating a particular behavior with STDs.\nFor instance, questions about condom use and number of sexual partners were weighted higher than those about past positive test results or age.\nThe respondents were mailed a home collection test kit.\nThat kit included a penile, vaginal or rectal swab that they could use and send free of charge to the Johns Hopkins laboratory.\nThere, the samples were tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea or trichomonas.\nDr Gaydos selected those three infections because they are easily screened for and treated – while other infections, such as HIV and syphilis, require blood testing.\nThe results showed a higher rate of STDs in women than men – 14 per cent compared to seven per cent.\nThe quiz also predicted that women who scored in the high- or medium- risk categories were four and two times more likely to have a STD than those who scored lower.\nNearly 20 million new STD cases are diagnosed in the US each year, according to the CDC. The quiz was found to be an accurate predictor of STDs in women, but not men. Scientists are currently working to improve the prediction results for men\nIn total, 117 of the female participants had at least one of three STDs, compared to 29 men, according to Dr Gaydos.\nThe ‘pop quiz’ accurately predicted STDs in women – but not men.\nDr Gaydos said: ‘We are not sure why this is – but untruthfulness or the fact that men tend to have lower STIs are posisbilities.’\nThe scientists plan to conduct follow-up research to increase the accuracy of the quiz for men and women.\nBecause an estimated 20 million STD cases are diagnosed annually in the US, there is a \"significant need\" for such affordable, quick assessment tools\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all women under the age of 25 be tested for STDs once a year.\nA self-risk quiz could help clinicians and consumers decide whether testing should be a priority, Dr Gaydos said.\nHowever, the quiz is voluntary – and many of the people who took the quiz may not have taken the home test – which may affect the generalizability of the results.\nThe home collection kit website averages 20,000 hits per month – and now offers home-performed HIV tests, as well.\nBecause an estimated 20 million STD cases are diagnosed annually in the US, there is a ‘significant need’ for such affordable, quick assessment tools, according to scientists.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3423170/The-six-questions-reveal-STD-quiz-experts-say-predict-woman-seek-medical-help.html"}
