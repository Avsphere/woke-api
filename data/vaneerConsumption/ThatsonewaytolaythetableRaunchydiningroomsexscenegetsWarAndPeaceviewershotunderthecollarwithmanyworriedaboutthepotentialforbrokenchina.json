Raunchy dining room sex scene gets War And Peace viewers hot under the collar - with many worried about the potential for broken china | Daily Mail Online","title_rss":"NULL","source_domain":"dailymail.co.uk","text":"A steamy dining table sex scene stole the show in the second episode of BBC blockbuster adaptation War and Peace last night...although some viewers were more concerned about broken crockery than they were about the raunchy goings-on.\nThe fruity scene from Tolstoy's epic novel saw the character of Hélène Kuragin (Tuppence Middleton) enjoy a culinary masterclass of a different kind at the hands of serial bed-hopper Fedya Dolokhov (Tom Burke).\nWith much clattering of crockery, the frantic sexual encounter saw Helene call her lover 'vile' and 'an animal' as the pair did the dirty on Helene's husband, Count Pierre Bezukhov (Paul Dano).\nScroll down for video\nA whole new meaning to the term 'laying the table': Sunday night's episode of War and Peace, which aired at 9pm on BBC One, saw the characters of Hélène Kuragin (Tuppence Middleton) and Fedya Dolokhov (Tom Burke) enjoy a steamy encounter on a dining table\nTension: Newly married Hélène Kuragin (Tuppence Middleton) - right - and Count Pierre Bezukhov (Paul Dano) - centre - share a table with Pierre's friend... Fedya Dolokhov (Tom Burke)...but when the count's back is turned the pair use the dining table for more than just eating\nThe highly charged scene left viewers considering the more practical elements of the encounter including the comfort of having sex on a table laid with cutlery and the risk to the Count's china.\n@ClareNewton wrote: 'They were doing rudies on the banqueting table and dislodged the butter knives. This is a disaster #WarandPeace.'\n'What about the Sevres china?' penned @SusannahOtter. While @oenanthe54 wrote: 'Wouldn't it be more comfortable to do that before laying the table?'\nOthers just went straight for pun: 'That what you call laying the table! Literally' wrote @loggy01.\nTom Burke's character Fedya Dolokhov caused a stir in Sunday night's episode after he made a play for Hélène, wife of central character Pierre\nWhat about the china? Viewers took to Twitter to question the location for the love scene, which saw the couple getting fruity on a table fully laid for dinner\n'What a vile animal you are...' Hélène whispered her version of sweet nothings in the ear of Dolokhov\nClatter...the raunchy scene, which was aired after the watershed, saw plenty of crockery disturbed\nCouldn't resist a pun! @loggy01 quipped about 'laying the table'\nDon't dislodge the butter knives: viewers were tickled by the dining table shenanigans\nWhile Tolstoy's tome didn't feature sex explicitly, it was heavily implied and BBC screenwriter Andrew Davies has chosen to feature more daring scenes in a bid to bring the 1869 novel to a 21st century audience.\nThe character of Hélène has already featured in some of the raunchiest scenes with the opening episode showing her in bed with her on-screen brother Anatole Kuragin (Callum Turner).\nAward-winning Davies, who is known for sexing up his literary adaptations, said: ‘I think she probably is the naughtiest woman on TV at the moment.\n‘I don’t know what Tolstoy thought of Hélène but I instantly took rather a liking to her.\nPracticalities: Some viewers pondered how comfortable it would be to have sex on a dining table\nWhat about the china? The scene was clearly a highlight for viewers tuning in for the show's second episode\nAndrew Davies, the writer behind the new adaptation of War and Peace, said he 'rather liked' the character of Hélène and was 'quite sympathetic' to her...but admitted she is probably the 'naughtiest woman on television'\n'I was quite sympathetic to her. It was one way of dealing with being a woman in an age when men made all of the decisions.'\nLater in the programme, the cuckolded Count Pierre challenged his love rival to a duel after receiving a note about the couple's affair.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3393561/That-s-one-way-lay-table-Raunchy-dining-room-sex-scene-gets-War-Peace-viewers-hot-collar-worried-potential-broken-china.html"}
