He allowed five runs on seven hits.\nTurner's triple highlighted a five-run seventh that put the Nationals ahead 15-5. But the Rockies scored two runs in the bottom half of the inning and four in the eighth when Charlie Blackmon hit a two-run homer.\nIt was the second cycle of the 2017 Major League Baseball season. The San Diego Padres' Wil Myers also hit for the cycle against the Rockies at Coors Field on April 10.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4446500/Nats-Turner-hits-cycle-win-Rockies.html"}
