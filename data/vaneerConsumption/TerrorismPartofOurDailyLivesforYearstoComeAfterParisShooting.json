The comments led to the socialist being cursed and jeered in public, and played a prominent role in terminating his own hopes of a presidential run.\nSalopard va!

We must reorganise the intelligence services, reinforce the means at the disposal of police and gendarmes, and attack the evil at its roots – that’s to say the communitarianism and the development of Islamic fundamentalism.”\nMs. Le Pen also said she would immediately deport all foreign nationals on the terror watch list if elected, asking rivals: “Explain to me why we should take the risk of keeping them in our territory?”\nIn a major speech on 18 April, the 48-year-old declared that “mass immigration” had not been “an opportunity for France, [but] a tragedy for France”.\nShe vowed to terminate France’s membership of the borderless Schengen Zone, criticised as an “international passport-free zone for terrorists” by former Interpol chief Robert Noble, and promised citizens: “I will protect you.”\n\"We must #protect the #French: we must protect their jobs, protect them from terrorism, protect them from insecurity.\" @MLP_officiel https://t.co/cIKDzxwWYj — Marine in English (@Marine2017_EN) April 12, 2017\nEmmanuel Macron, a former Rothschild banker, was economy minister under the outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, who claimed, “I will leave the country to my successor in much better condition than I found it” shortly before yesterday’s shooting.\nThe attack was the latest in a series of high-profile Islamist attacks under his premiership, beginning with the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January 2015.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/04/21/macron-terrorism-part-daily-lives-years-paris-shooting/"}
