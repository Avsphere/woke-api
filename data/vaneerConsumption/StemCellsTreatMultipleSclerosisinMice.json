The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nHuman embryonic stem cells — the body’s powerful master cells — might be useful for treating multiple sclerosis, researchers reported Thursday.\nA team has used cells taken from frozen human embryos and transformed them into a type of cell that scientists have hoped might help treat patients with MS, a debilitating nerve disease.\nMice with an induced version of MS that paralyzed them were able to walk freely after the treatment, the teams at Advanced Cell Technology and ImStem Biotechnology in Farmington, Connecticut, reported.\nThe cells appeared to travel to the damaged tissues in the mice, toning down the mistaken immune system response that strips the fatty protective layer off of nerve calls. It’s that damage that causes symptoms ranging from tremors and loss of balance to blurry vision and paralysis.\nThese embryonic stem cells were carefully nurtured to make them form a type of immature cell called a mesenchymal stem cell. These cells worked better to treat the mice than naturally developed mesenchymal stem cells taken directly from bone marrow, the team wrote in the journal Stem Cell Reports, published by the International Society for Stem Cell Research.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/stem-cells-treat-multiple-sclerosis-mice-n123761"}
