First they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.”\n(Stefan Rousseau/PA)\nMr Nutall, who has yet to say whether he will stand in the June 8 General Election, declined to forecast how many seats Ukip might win.\n“I’m not going to put a figure on what I think is winnable,” he said. “There’s six weeks to go in this – a lot can happen in the opinion polls.\n“If you get a Ukip MP… you will get people who have campaigned for clean Brexit – the type of Brexit people voted for on June 23 – all their lives.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4447060/Ukip-leader-Nutall-People-laughed-Gandhi-too.html"}
