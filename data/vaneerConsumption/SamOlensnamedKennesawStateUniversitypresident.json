He’s a former county commissioner and two-term commission chairman. His detractors complained the selection process wasn’t inclusive and have concerns about his ability to represent the interest of all students, particularly those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\nMore than two dozen KSU students and faculty came to Wednesday’s meeting to voice their displeasure with the vote. Several students interrupted the board at the beginning of the meeting and chanted “we must love each other and protect each other” before exiting the meeting.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/sam-olens-named-kennesaw-state-university-president/GjtASynzfeHYKNLj569ovN/"}
