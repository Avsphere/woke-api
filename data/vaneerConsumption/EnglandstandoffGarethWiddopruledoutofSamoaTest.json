Always an honour to be selected 💪🏽💪🏽 — Sam Burgess (@SamBurgess8) April 26, 2017\nHowever, Austin did admit that he didn’t want to “offend anybody” if it meant switching his allegiance from the Kangaroos to the English.\n“That’d be something you consider further down the track. I know a lot of players come out and voice their opinion on things like that and I wouldn’t want to offend anybody,” he said.\n“Obviously it means a lot more to those guys than it would to me and Origin is on the top of my goals list but if they reached out to me then it’s something I would think about for sure.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4446958/England-stand-Gareth-Widdop-ruled-Samoa-Test.html"}
