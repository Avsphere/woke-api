In each of these cases, Obama’s response was to characterize gun owners in general in light of the twisted actions of “very few.”\nOn January 5, he went even further by issuing executive orders to unilaterally expand gun controls, which heaps more regulations on federal gun dealers and law-abiding gun owners alike.\nThink about it—the president who says, “the violent acts of the very few” Muslims should not be held against the majority of Muslims is subsequently seizing on “the violent acts” of a “very few” gun owners and holding those actions against the 130 to 140 million gun owners who never have—nor ever will—misuse a gun. Moreover, in addition to new gun laws, Obama has even hinted at confiscation for all gun owners, based on the actions of “very few.”\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
