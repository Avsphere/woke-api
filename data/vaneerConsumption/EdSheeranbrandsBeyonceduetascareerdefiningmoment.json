Even just standing near her onstage makes me look better - just because she’s really that amazing. She has this aura around her of just talent.\n'Rehearsing with her, hearing her sing up close is just a thing to marvel. Even if my career ended tomorrow, I’ll still be able to tell my grand kids that I got to sing with Beyoncé. She will be remembered as one of the greats.'\nThe record-breaking 26-year-old singer also gushed about getting the chance to meet Beyoncé's husband, Jay Z.\nHe continued: 'I always had opportunities to meet Jay Z, and in my mind, I never want to meet someone and just shake hands and get a selfie. I want to meet someone for the first time and have a really intelligent conversation about music.\nClose pals: The pair have hit the stage together on a number of occasions, most recently back in 2015 for a Grammy Awards tribute\nCollaboration: The flame haired star hopes to record a song with the former Destiny's Child star in the near-future\n'So I held out with Jay Z, and the first time I met him, he came up to me and said, 'Hello, really nice to meet you. Should we go to dinner and chat?' That’s a rule I’ve had for every single musician that I’ve admired.'\nThe Shape of You pop star said that he loves spending time with the couple - who are expecting twins - off the stage too because they are 'so human and just normal' people.\nHe told People magazine: 'I had the thing in my mind where you just assume something. And then they’re so human and lovely and nice and normal and talk about normal things and do normal things.'\n'It was being invited into a world that you were kind of scared to enter into, and then you just realise.\nHe added: 'They’re a very, very loving couple, and it’s obviously a world that’s filled with love and respect, and it’s lovely to see.\n'I feel like the media and the public see one thing, and what it actually is, it’s a really cool thing. And they’re really nice people.'\nEarlier this week 26-year-old singer then started trending on Twitter on Wednesday after a prank by Radio One DJ Greg James went viral.\nEd kicked things off by tweeting earlier this month: '@JamesBlunt lets celebrate our albums coming out this month with an album party ! #analbumparty'.\nBut it was Greg's tweet which really caused a social media stir when he joked on Wednesday morning: 'In honour of #Susanalbumparty, we're having an impromptu #Sheeranalbumparty. Gonna listen to some of Ed's album #LOLathon'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4318448/Ed-Sheeran-brands-Beyonce-duet-career-defining-moment.html"}
