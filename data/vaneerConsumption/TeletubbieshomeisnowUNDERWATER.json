The instantly-recognisable characters waving from the site, which is now completely flooded\nHe said: 'They kept it very secret, they wouldn't let any kids on the site at all.\n'It was about three fields from the farm house so it was out of site and all we saw was the rush in the morning and afternoon.\n'They did the Tots TV here too which was marvellous to watch.\n'Of the 40 million to show brought in I only saw around £1,000 each month when they were there, thinking about it now I probably should've insisted on a percentage!\n'They came and dug the hole to put the site in then filled it with water when they left.\n'They took everything away, levelled off the grass and filled it in. It's now a nice wildlife lake.\n'It was very interesting to have them there and something different.'\nWife Rosemary Harding previously said they had several people trespassing to get a glimpse of the secluded area.\nMrs Harding, 63, now runs an aquatics plant and fish shop from their family farm and said she still spots the odd tourist.\nAt its peak, BBC's popular children's show was broadcast in a whopping 80 countries.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319880/Teletubbies-home-UNDERWATER.html"}
