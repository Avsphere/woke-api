Monica Faye Blackwell had been raped and killed, and the assailant was gone.\nNow the man accused is in the DeKalb County jail. Samuel McCullum, 52, was connected to Blackwell’s death by DNA after his 2002 “unlawful imprisonment” of a 17-year-old girl in Kentucky, according to the DeKalb DA’s office.\nMcCullum was extradited to Georgia last week after completing his sentence in Kentucky. He faces charges of rape and murder in Blackwell’s death and is also awaiting trial in another local rape, the DA’s office said.\nWarrants released this week to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution don’t specify how McCullum is accused of killing Blackwell. But the documents say he killed her and dumped her on the side of Porter Road at about 11 p.m.\nThe DA’s office declined to release further information on the case.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/dna-hit-spurs-arrest-1998-rape-killing-woman-dekalb/bLtBVGi4eIQNiV1CLquyhO/"}
