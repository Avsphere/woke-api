It has nothing to do with Islamists or terrorism.\"\nHe spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The office of the prosecutor later confirmed there was no indication of terrorism.\nForensic teams could be seen overnight going in and out of the cafe collecting evidence.\nProsecutors said police were looking for two men, aged between 30 and 40, who are believed to be eastern European. They had black hair and wore dark clothing.\nThe attack comes a day after the town concluded celebrations of Fasnacht, the largest carnival in Switzerland.\n___\nFrank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this story.\nA forensic team investigates the scene after deadly gunfire was unleashed in Cafe 56, Friday, March 10, 2017, in Basel, Switzerland.
