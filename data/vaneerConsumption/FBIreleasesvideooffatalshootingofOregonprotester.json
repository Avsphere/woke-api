Agents and troopers on scene had information that Finicum and others would be armed,\" said Bretzing.\n\"On at least two occasions, Finicum reaches his right hand toward a pocket on the left inside portion of his jacket. He did have a loaded nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun in that pocket.\n\"At this time, OSP (state) troopers shot Finicum.\"\nThree remaining people in the truck, including Bundy's 43-year-old brother Ryan, were taken into custody and officials then gave medical help to Finicum.\n\"That happened about 10 minutes after the shooting,\" said Bretzing, adding that they found three loaded weapons in the truck, including two semi-automatic rifles.\n- End to the standoff? -\nEarlier Thursday, a convoy of 30 armored vehicles rolled into the wildlife refuge, appearing to point at an imminent intervention by law enforcement to drive out the last protesters, estimated by the FBI at four.\nThere were about 30 protesters at the refuge last week.\nProtest leader Bundy reiterated his call for those left to surrender.\n\"Turn yourselves in and do not use physical force,\" the 40-year-old said in a statement released by his lawyers.\nBundy urged his supporters to \"continue to defend liberty through our constitutional rights,\" including through the use of media and social media.\n\"We only had guns for our protection and never once pointed them at another individual or had any desire to do so,\" he added. \"The people have a right to bear arms for their own protection. We never wanted bloodshed.\"\nThe Bundy brothers are the sons of Cliven Bundy, 69, a vitriolic anti-government activist who in 2014 engaged in an armed standoff with federal authorities over unpaid cattle grazing fees at his Nevada ranch.\nCliven Bundy claimed that Finicum was shot \"in cold blood\" while he had his hands in the air.\nBundy and his supporters took over the wildlife refuge on January 2 to protest at the jailing of two local ranchers, Dwight Hammond and his son Steven, who were convicted of arson.\nTheir demands soon grew to include calls for the government to turn over area federal land to local ranchers. In Oregon, nearly 53 percent of the land is federally owned.\nThe Hammonds distanced themselves from the movement and voluntarily began their scheduled prison sentences after the occupation began.\nA group of more than 20 people marched up and down N.
