Because if it's a howler, you're going to make people very unhappy.\"\nIndeed, the amount of power required and the quantity of air that needs to be moved to get a vehicle skyborne more or less guarantees a noisy and potentially deadly ride. They aren't easy to drive, either: You need 20 hours of flight training before you can cruise around in the Transition, and of course you can't land it on your street â€” it has to be coordinated with air traffic control and put down at an airport. Not to mention it costs $279,000.\nSo while Musk does say they might build a flying car \"just for fun,\" it's not likely you'll see it or any other flying cars on (or above) the road any time soon. It'll be a few years before they're anything but expensive toys for pilots.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/teslas-elon-musk-it-wouldnt-be-hard-build-flying-car-n126566"}
