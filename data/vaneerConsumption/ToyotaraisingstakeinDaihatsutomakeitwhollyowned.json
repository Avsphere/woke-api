Toyota now owns 51.2 percent of Daihatsu Motor Co.\nDaihatsu shareholders will get 0.26 Toyota shares for each Daihatsu share they own. More than 54 million Toyota shares are expected to be involved in the share exchange, the companies said, which values the deal at $3.2 billion based on Toyota's closing share price on Friday.\nBoth sides said the move will allow Toyota and Daihatsu to work more closely together and pool resources on future technologies, while maintaining their separate brands.\n\"This is an opportunity for us both to stop feeling that we need to go it alone, and trust each other to take full advantage of our respective strengths. In other words, we can now focus on our core competencies,\" Toyota President Akio Toyoda said.\nIt needs shareholder support in a general meeting set for June.\nThe move highlights Toyota's ambitions to keep growing after outpacing Volkswagen AG of Germany and U.S. rival General Motors Co. in global vehicle sales, selling 10.15 million vehicles around the world last year.\nMinicars continue to be a strong seller not only in Japan but other Asian nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia. In Japan, cars 3.4 meters (11 feet) or shorter in length with an engine size of 660 cc or smaller qualify for hefty tax breaks.\nDaihatsu President Masanori Mitsui said the deal would secure the automaker's ability to grow in the long term.\nThe last day of stock market trading for Daihatsu is planned for July 26, and its delisting July 27.\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama: twitter.com/yurikageyama","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422331/Toyota-raising-stake-Daihatsu-make-wholly-owned.html"}
