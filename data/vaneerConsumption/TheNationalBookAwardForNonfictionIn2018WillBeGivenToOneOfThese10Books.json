It's no secret that there is a lot going on politically both in the United States and beyond, and these books are completely indicative of the many different topics at the forefront of the American consciousness right now. From One Person, No Vote, Carol Anderson's book about voter suppression to Rebecca Solnit's Call Them By Their True Names, her examination of the country's gun violence epidemic, these 10 books all have their finger on the pulse of some of the most controversial topics confronting Americans right now.\n2017's National Book Award for Nonfiction winner, Masha Gessen's The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia, examined the cyclical history of Russia and what made it possible for the unobstructed reemergence of the old Soviet order in the form of today's terrifying and seemingly unstoppable mafia state.
