So tomorrow is going to be a different challenge but looking forward to it.\"\nGrace, who described conditions as \"brutal\", hit a four under par 68 to finish on 11 under, thanks to a storming finish.\nHis birdies at 16, 17 and 18 followed a birdie at the par five first, and 14 pars as he produced high-quality and consistent golf on a day when others struggled in cold and windy conditions.\n\"I pretty much got the most out of my round today. I don't really think I left any out there, so four under was a great score.\"\nPrior to the tournament, the South African said his chances of winning again in Qatar were \"slim\".\nLike Lawrie, Grace, who won with a score of 19 under last year, did not make a single bogey all day.\n- 'Brutal' conditions -\nConditions on Friday were probably the toughest of the week so far and temperatures hovered around 15 degrees celsius (59) fahrenheit, with the strong wind making it feel colder.\nAside from the two potential history-makers, and Olssen, Saturday's final round promises excitement as a number of players bunched up behind Lawrie and Grace.\nSpain's Rafa Cabrera-Bello and England's Tommy Fleetwood, both finished on 10 under.\n\"It was tough but, you know, you've just got to get on with it,\" said Fleetwood, who shot a 70.\nOne shot further back on nine under, sit a further four players, France's Gregory Bourdy, Sweden's Pelle Edberg, England's Andrew Johnston and Lee Slattery, whose round of 69 pushed him 14 places up the leaderboard.\nRound of the day came from England's Richard Bland, who shot a five under par 67 to finish on eight under and tied in 10th position.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3423007/Lawrie-Grace-set-final-day-battle-Qatar-Masters.html"}
