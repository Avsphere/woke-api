Look at the root system, because the root system is really a critical point of failure.”\nDuring periods of drought, including some of the most recent dry spells between 2007 and 2009, metro trees suffered and were weakened. Some metro trees are still trying to recover, according to experts.\nBut during particularly wet spells such as the past two weeks, trees are dealing with the opposite situation. Highly saturated soil has made trees weaker, more likely to topple, Burgess said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/weather/soggy-conditions-lead-problems-for-area-trees/GapwiFlV4Wk5LihCOVLOAJ/"}
