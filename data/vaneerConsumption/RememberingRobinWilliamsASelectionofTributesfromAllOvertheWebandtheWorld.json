From Aladdin to Jumanji, and from Hook to Good Will Hunting, and from Mrs. Doubtfire to Dead Poet’s Society, those films were the flickering images and sounds of my childhood; I grew up with Genie, and John Keating, and all the rest — they made me laugh, think, and so much more.\nIt seems odd sometimes that the loss of someone you’ve never even met can hit you so hard; but that’s the beauty of what Williams did: Through his artistry, he reached out far beyond the screens on which we watched him, and he hit us all right where it counts. It’s why we feel his loss so deeply, regardless as to whether or not we personally knew him.
