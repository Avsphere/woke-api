Several wrecks were reported during the peak morning commute on I-75 in Cobb and Henry counties, I-85 in Gwinnett County and I-20 east of downtown.\nLocal officials warned that hazardous conditions could continue throughout the evening.\n“We have no current issues, but we encourage drivers to be safe and call 511 to report any areas with standing water or flooding on the roadways,” said Natalie Dale, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Transportation.\nSo far at least, Nov. 2 — the Day of the Dead in Mexican traditions — hasn’t lived up to its name. No flood-related fatalities had been reported as of early afternoon.\nWorkers at the state Department of Transportation checked and cleared standing water at the following locations: I-20 East from Hill Street to Boulevard; I-20 at Candler Road; Piedmont Road at Miami Circle; and I-75 North at Howell Mill Road.\nPiedmont Road at Miami Circle is still a potential hotspot for flooding this evening, according to City of Atlanta officials.\nThe downpour prompted several road closures in Gwinnett County. Harbins Road is closed from Arrowind Road to Jay Way; Hillcrest Road is closed from Old Manor Road to Indian Trail Road and Brannan Road is closed from Leach Road.\nDeKalb County officials were warning drivers to avoid traveling through standing water.\n“You can’t see the bottom. You might think you can make it, but every video you’ve ever seen of someone floating down the current is someone who thought they could make it,” said DeKalb spokesman Burke Brennan.\nMARTA spokeswoman Alisa Jackson said the transit agency is operating as normal and that the rain would not impact afternoon schedules.\n*Staff reporters Arielle Kass, Mark Niesse and Mike Morris contributed to this story.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/watch-for-flooded-areas-your-evening-commute/PAFOPtnL4ickxE6aBgLvEO/"}
