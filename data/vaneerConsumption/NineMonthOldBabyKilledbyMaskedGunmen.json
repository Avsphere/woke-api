Their names were not released.\n“This incident, we believe is a possible retaliatory act in response to the murder of the female, Alexis Malone, that had occurred where her body was found earlier that day,” Alexander added. “It’s complicated. It’s insane. It’s insane.”\nMalone was the witness to the May 3 shooting of Michael Phillips, 29, at a party in south DeKalb, according to The Atlanta Journal Constitution.\nAuthorities have arrested 18-year-old Kemontae Cullins in connection with that shooting, according to 11 Alive. Police are also looking to arrest Cutrez Johnson, 16, also known as “Lil Red,” and Oslushla Smith, 19, also known as Budda or Boo in connection with the crime.\n— Henry Austin","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nine-month-old-baby-killed-masked-gunmen-n102826"}
