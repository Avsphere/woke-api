The developer wants to build the homes on 56 acres adjacent to commercial development on Scenic Highway. But it’s also surrounded on three sides by single-family subdivisions.\nThe county planning staff has recommended the county reject the proposal, saying it could be inconsistent with existing neighborhoods and with the county’s long-range plan for the area. On Tuesday, local residents expressed concerns about traffic and school overcrowding.\nPlanning commissioners voted 9-0 to recommend denial of the proposal, though the Gwinnett Board of Commissioners will have the final say.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/gwinnett-planning-commission-rejects-plan-for-300-apartments/FpESFzmoHY2bO1uFvoQlUL/"}
