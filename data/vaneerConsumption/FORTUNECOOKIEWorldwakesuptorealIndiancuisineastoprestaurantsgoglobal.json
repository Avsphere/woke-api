He’s also in one of the most competitive restaurant markets in the world, where everyone in the business is vying for a Michelin star.\nBut the thought of having to prove himself yet again has got Mehrotra all charged up.\nThe good news, though, is that Indian Accent is not alone in trying to spread its wings outside of our familiar shores. Punjab Grill, which has been riding on the back of its authentic pind da menu to grow steadily across India, has recently opened in Abu Dhabi and Bangkok.\nAnd its chefs have launched a new brand called American Tandoor at Tysons Corner Center, one of the largest malls in the Washington DC-Northern Virginia-Baltimore triangle.\nIndian restaurants steered by homegrown promoters, such as American Tandoor (above) and Indian Accent are going overseas to open in competitive markets such as Washington DC, New York, Dubai and Bangkok\nAnd according to Monica Bhide, the well-regarded food writer, the restaurant was packed on the day she first went to it, the service was friendly, and - unlike most other Indian outlets - it did not deliver 'toned down, tasteless dishes'.\nFarzi Cafe, the hugely successful restaurant franchise spearheaded by Zorawar Kalra, is all set to open this year at the City Walk Phase 2 on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai, with 'an Arabic-influenced global cuisine menu'.\nAnd TresInd, the Modern Indian restaurant that opened in Dubai last year to critical acclaim, is well on target to open a 'post-modern Indian' restaurant named Carnival, also in Dubai.\nUnlike diasporic Indian restaurants of the past, which sprung up mostly in the UK with the money of local investors, these are successful home-grown brands that are exploring new frontiers to target not only NRIs and travelling Indians, who are shockingly unadventurous about food (I am not talking here of the minuscule minority with an evolved palate), but also the growing number of people around the world who want to savour ‘real’ Indian food.\nBhide, for instance, was most excited about the opening of Indian Accent and American Tandoor because she felt these restaurants would change once and for all the perception of Indian cuisine in her adopted country, where most people are convinced that we eat unpalatably hot and heavy food presented without finesse.\nBy altering this perception, chefs such as Mehrotra, and his point man in New York, Vivek Rana (who’s the man to watch), Himanshu Saini, and Satinder Singh of American Tandoor (who’s all of 26) will be doing great service to the cause of our cuisine.\nConversely, for an upcoming chef such as Satinder Singh, working in a discerning and demanding market is a great opportunity to upskill oneself and also get exposed to the best ingredients from neighbouring farms and from across the world. With our restaurants going international, Indian chefs will gain both wisdom and stature.\nEating on the road less traveled\nChristine Manfield was introduced to the 'craziness of India' when she first came from Sydney to Chennai as a guest chef in residence at the Taj Coromandel in the 1990s.\nThat was the start of her romance with India, and she has been coming back once or twice a year for the past 16 years, leading groups of Australians on culinary tours across the country.\nCurating these tours has made the chef-restaurateur and spice lover-turned-prolific author and communicator a walking encyclopedia on India’s culinary secrets, which we got to savour in her lavishly produced tour de force, Tasting India (2011).\nChristine Manfield was in New Delhi to promote her encyclopedic book, A Personal Guide to India and Bhutan\nNow comes A Personal Guide to India and Bhutan (Penguin/Lantern: available on Amazon), which takes us into well-known restaurants of big cities and holes in the wall tucked away in uncelebrated lanes of small towns.\nThe bulk of the book is about what to eat, but most of her recommendations are in complete contrast to the places she suggests for staying in.\nKebabs are her personal favourites - 'I search for the best kebabs anywhere I go,' she says, even as she notes with a sense of satisfaction 'a greater appreciation for street food' and 'a growing awareness of the versatility and diversity of regional cuisines' among Indians.\nChristine has had meals at restaurants as far removed geographically as Imran’s in Srinagar, Kulcha Land and Surjit Food Plaza in Amritsar, Anand Dal Vada at Usmanpura, Ahmedabad, Bademiya in Mumbai, Old Harbour Hotel in Kochi, Arsalan in Kolkata and the Glenburn Estate in Darjeeling.\nI asked Christine to name the unforgettable food experiences that have got embedded in her culinary memory.\nShe started with Ahdoos Hotel in Srinagar for its roghan josh and ended her tour at the street-side vada and puttu stalls in Kochi, via the lassi shop opposite Niro’s in Jaipur, malai ghevar at Janta Sweet Home, Jodhpur, Johnny’s hot dogs in Indore, poha and jalebi at Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh and Govind’s in Hyderbad for its butter dosa.\nThis is one book you can’t afford not to possess.\nWhimsical Babus and Aerocity’s Woes\nThe New Delhi Aerocity hotels seem to be condemned to suffer.\nThey have been operating for more than a year with most of their rooms sealed because the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security woke up suddenly - after the hotels had been built - to security concerns.\nThe hotels were made to spend a fortune and reinforce the windows of their sealed rooms to make them bulletproof, yet they haven’t got security clearances.\nMany of the rooms in new hotel openings in Aerocity (above) are sealed off due to security sensitivities\nAs if this wasn’t enough, the hotels that are now opening in the area, which was developed as a magnet for the international meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) business, are not being given liquor licences.\nImagine a French hotel chain, namely Accor, having to plant its flag in Delhi with its two leading brands, Pullman and Novotel, without the permission to serve its impressive wine collection. Is this how the government proposes to get the world to come to India?","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3419803/FORTUNE-COOKIE-World-wakes-real-Indian-cuisine-restaurants-global.html"}
