This includes £2.5m to represent the amount that would have been received by good causes had the prize claim not been paid.\nCamelot said it accepts the Gambling Commission's findings. \"The allegation is not related in any way to The National Lottery draws,\" the firm added.\n\"It only concerns the controls that were in place at the time to prevent a fraudulent claim on a deliberately damaged ticket - and is limited to a unique incident alleged to have taken place over seven years ago.\"\nCamelot said it notified the commission and got in contact with the police as soon as the allegation was brought to the company's attention in late 2015, and has co-operated fully with both of them ever since.\n\"Although the alleged incident occurred a long time ago, we have provided all possible assistance to help establish what might have happened in this very complex case,\" said Camelot.\nThe police confirmed earlier this year that they would be taking no further action following their own investigation.\nNews of the fine comes just weeks after Camelot revealed that around 26,500 online lottery accounts had been hacked.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/national-lottery-owner-fined-3-million-over-a-fraudulent-prize-claim-2016-12"}
