So do I.\n“It is time to get on with leaving the European Union and building the independent, self-governing, global Britain the British people have called for.\n“And so, as I have said, we will trigger Article 50 by the end of this month. This will be a defining moment for the UK as we begin the process of forging a new role for ourselves in the world - as a strong country with control over our borders and over our laws.”\nBut she signalled she was ready for a fight over demands for a Brexit “divorce bill” which could potentially run to tens of billions of pounds.\nMrs May said: “I’m clear that the way people voted on June 23 for us to leave the European Union, they voted for us in the future not paying huge sums of money into the European Union every year.\n“And of course when we leave the EU that will be the case.”\nEU27 #Brexit consultation today w/ President Radev.
