Braun was credited with blocking 25 defenders to the ground on just 72 snaps, helping the Jackets gain 465 rushing yards. Virginia Tech had not given up that many rushing yards in 45 years.\n“Parker Braun played really well,” coach Paul Johnson said Sunday on his teleconference.\nOliver was named co-rookie of the week as he made the start in place of starter TaQuon Marshall. Oliver ran for 215 yards on 40 carries, the second highest rushing total for a quarterback in the school’s history (behind Marshall’s 249 against Tennessee last season) and the seventh highest regardless of position.\nTech plays at North Carolina Saturday.\nTo Tobias Oliver’s high-school coach, Thursday looked awfully familiar\nParker Braun used to be a distance runner. Now he mauls defensive tackles.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/sports/college/tobias-oliver-parker-braun-honored-acc/TSFEsgAGqTbYeBVxUKqSHL/"}
