I went to a party recently and got very drunk and had sex with all the guys there. There was porn on the TV and, stupidly, I decided to copy it. Now I’ve discovered that I’m pregnant – none of the men there wore condoms. I don’t know what to do about the baby but I don’t think it’s sensible to continue with the pregnancy. I obviously have no idea who the father is – he could be any one of 25. I feel very ashamed.\nThere but for the grace of God go we all, eh?\nLuckily Coleen is on hand with some sensitive advice (which doesn’t neglect to include a bit of fashionable man-blaming)","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2015/04/14/help-i-just-accidentally-slept-with-25-men-and-i-dont-know-who-the-father-is/"}
