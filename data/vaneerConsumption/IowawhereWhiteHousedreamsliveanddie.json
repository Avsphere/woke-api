Bush is the only Republican winner in a competitive Iowa race to go on to win the White House.\nWhat Iowa is better at is winnowing the field.\nIts first-in-the-nation status makes it the subject of intense media interest.\nAfter months of imperfect polling, it comes as the first real test of campaigns and of candidates' guile and steel.\nIt has long been an article of faith that there are only \"three tickets out of Iowa\" for each party.\nPlace lower than gold, silver or bronze, and a candidate is very unlikely to win the party nomination.\nRepublican John McCain is the only member of either party to have finished below third and still win the nomination since the caucuses began in 1972.\nMore often, a fourth place finish means funding, endorsements and media coverage dry up.\nThat is not good news for Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum.\nBut Iowa voters are also notoriously fickle.\nFrom the progressive cities and east to the conservative north and central belt, many voters do not make up their minds until hours before election day.\nOn the Democratic side, both Clinton and Bernie Sanders are likely to survive a tight race and move on to New Hampshire.\n\"Momentum and excitement appear to be more on Sanders' side, but he may be over-reliant on a base of supporters that are not well-distributed throughout the state and a bit less likely to turn out at the level he needs,\" analysts Larry Sabato and Kyle Kondik wrote online.\nA win for Sanders would energize his campaign even further but would also increase comparisons to George McGovern, a fellow leftist who did well in Iowa and won the 1972 nomination only to be pummeled by Richard Nixon in the general election.\nWithout Iowa, there would be no President Barack Obama, whose win in the state in 2008 catapulted the junior Illinois senator into the national and international spotlight ©Mandel Ngan (AFP/File)","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3422110/Iowa-White-House-dreams-live-die.html"}
