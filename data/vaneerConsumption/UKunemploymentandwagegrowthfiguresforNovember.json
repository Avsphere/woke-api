Credit Suisse, for example, predicts an increase to 6.5% for the base rate, equivalent to roughly 500,000 jobs being lost. However, November saw the rate remain near its record low and Wednesday's figures show the trend appears to be holding up.\nThe Bank of England expects unemployment to rise to 5.5% once the full effects of the referendum are felt across the economy. However, BOE governor Mark Carney has said that the bank is willing to allow inflation to overshoot its target in order to protect jobs.\nAverage earning grew by 2.5% in November, a slight acceleration on October's figure of 2.4%, and in line with the 2.5% that was forecast prior to the release.\nThere was one major disappointment in the figures, with the UK's employment rate falling for the first time in over a year, dropping marginally from 74.5% to 74.4%.\n\"The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 74.4%, slightly down from the joint record high of 74.5% recorded for May to July 2016 but higher than for a year earlier (73.9%),\" the ONS' release said.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-unemployment-wage-growth-october-september-brexit-2016-12"}
