It was ridiculous, so we thought, \"Let's catch him in the act\".'\nNow, his next door neighbours Jonathan and Robyn Tan (pictured) say they have filmed Mr Hutt turning around a planning notice giving details of how people living in the area could challenge his appeal to lift the restrictions\nThe notices were put up on November 25, and Mr Tan says he has seen Mr Hutt turn around the sign on several occasions, as the businessman was headed to his job as chief financial officer at the firm Pershing\nSneaky: Mrs Tan filmed Mr Hutt spin the sign around so that it faced the road, instead of the pavement (shown)\nDismissive: Mr Hutt said: 'That [the video] is too trivial to discuss. This is not a mega-basement. We don't understand why people are upset by the plans'\nAfter waiting by a window with her phone, Mrs Tan filmed Mr Hutt spin the sign around so that it faced the road, instead of the pavement.\nThey then posted the footage on Facebook and it was later shown to a meeting of planning chiefs at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\nHowever, Mr Hutt won his fight for the restrictions to be lifted, on the proviso that the work complies with a report by environmental consultants and following the implementation of a plan to manage traffic during the excavations.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421317/City-finance-boss-caught-film-hiding-planning-notice-Chelsea-neighbours-bitter-basement-row.html"}
