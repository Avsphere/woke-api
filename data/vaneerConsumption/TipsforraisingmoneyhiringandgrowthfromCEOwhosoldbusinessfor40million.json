When you're just starting out you only need a \"shop window\" to prove what you're doing is viable, Crane says. \"I don't think you need a NATO-sized war chest to go and do that.\"\n\"Off the back of that, you think very carefully about how you then scale,\" he adds. \"You don't want to ramp costs, although growth does involve cost. A lot of my friends are in startups and what I hear all the time is: 'I raised VC money, it's great but they want me to hire 40 more people and I don't know what I'd do with 4 of them.'\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-raising-money-hiring-growth-entrepreneur-tech-ceo-grapple-who-sold-business-2016-12"}
