Maybe even with a touch of thunderstorm.\nBut what do you plan to do, hide under your bed all day? You’re better than that, Atlanta.\nWell, you’re better than that if there’s something really fun to do.\nAsk and you shall receive. Here are three things going on this Monday in and around town that not only will keep you entertained, two of them will keep you inside where it’s cool. The third one? Let’s just say if you gorge yourself on enough ballpark franks and peanuts (and perhaps an adult beverage or two?), you won’t care what the weather’s like.\n“‘SUNDAYS AT FOUR’ AT AMERICAN MUSICAL THEATRE FESTIVAL”\nThat’s right, a show about Sunday dinner on Monday night. But it’s worth the extra day’s wait to get to see the Washington family gather for their weekly serving of food and practical wisdom from Grandma Washington. When powerful personalities collide, the theater’s synopsis tantalizingly asks, “Will the Washington family ever recover? And will they continue to meet every Sunday at four?” Festival continues Tuesday with a production of “The Fairy Hoax.” 8 p.m. Festival pass $50; individual shows $12-$17. Out Front Theatre Company, 999 Brady Ave., Atlanta.www.outfronttheatre.com.\nSaoirse Ronan won a Best Actress Golden Globe for “Lady Bird.” MERRICK MORTON/A24 (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)\n“MOVIE MONDAY: ‘LADY BIRD’”\nNominated for five Oscars and winner of Best Picture and Best Actress at last winter’s Golden Globes, this equal parts hilarious and touching tale of a 17-year-old girl (Saoirse Ronan) coming of age in Sacramento is worth seeing again or for the first time in the bucolic heart of Norcross. For free! Depending on which showing you choose, you can bring along lunch or dinner, or enjoy the popcorn, water and “other movie treats” available on site. 1:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Doors open 30 minutes before each show time. Free. Norcross Cultural Arts & Community Center, 10 College St., Norcross. www.aplacetoimagine.com\n“ATLANTA BRAVES VS. MIAMI MARLINS. TWICE!”\nYour Atlanta Braves have been in or thisclose to first place for much of this suprising season. Someone Else’s Miami Marlins have been in the basement pretty much the same amount of time. But so what, Monday’s a great time to head out to the ballpark, when good seats are more available, traffic is a (bit) better and Freddie Freeman, Nick Markakis and Ozzie Albies won’t let up one bit. This is a day-night doubleheader, with the early game making up for Aug. 1’s rainout. Game One: 1:35 p.m. $10-$117. Game Two: 7:35 p.m. $5-$97. SunTrust Park, 755 Battery Ave. S.E., Atlanta. www.mlb.com/braves\n>>See what’s in store on the weather and traffic front before you head out\nLooking for more?
