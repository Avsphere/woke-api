One customer filed a complaint in the U.S., but more than 200 complaints were received from other countries.\nDealers will replace the charging system regulator-rectifier to fix the problem. Suzuki will notify owners and begin the recall repairs in early March at no cost to owners.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421046/Suzuki-recalls-68K-motorcycles-stalling-risk.html"}
