From one British woman married to a Frenchman to another. You and I are long overdue The Talk. Girl – you’ve played this all wrong.\nI have defended you to all of my girlfriends, alongside my acquaintances online. We’re kindred souls you and I. Like you, everyone laughed at me when, after six weeks of dating my Frenchie, I declared to the world ‘I love him! I’m moving to France to pursue my Happily Ever After.’\nProbably like your nearest and dearest, they rolled their eyes and said 'I give it a year.' My posse of girlfriends even announced – at my wedding, no less! – that I’d be divorced before I knew it.\nWriter Samantha Brick, 44, from France (pictured with husband Pascal) sees Cheryl Fernandez-Versini as a 'kindred soul' and believes the singer has played her most recent marriage 'all wrong'\nCheryl and her husband Jean Bernard Fernandez-Versini were last seen in public together in October at Ant and Dec's joint 40th birthday party. The pair are believed to have recently filed for a divorce\nBut here I am. Nearly eight years after marrying my Monsieur. Happier than I have ever been.\nI understand why you couldn’t wait to put a ring on it. The French have seduction imprinted into their DNA. Aren’t they the best? Don’t you feel fantastic when they’re wooing you?\nWhen they repeatedly tell us that we’re the most beautiful woman they’ve ever met and how they want to spend the rest of their lives with us?\nOf course we believe them. Then there are the grand gestures of l’amour. The gifts, the calls, the desire to get along with our nearest and dearest.\nIt is a heady, showy love potion that makes us drop our knickers faster than they can say 'Je t’aime'.\nLike you, I met my Monsieur when I was on holiday in France. I knew that Kim Kardashian would have to stop taking selfies before my husband would entertain the idea of a permanent move to the UK.\nSamantha Brick has been married to her husband Pascal for eight years, and believes she has learned a thing or two about the highs and lows of being married to a Frenchman\nSurely you’d already cottoned on, Cheryl, that every Frenchman believes their country of birth is the greatest (the only) place to live?\nI understand the cock-eyed reason for your marital breakdown may be jealousy. Oh come on Cheryl.\nThe French in love reckon jealousy is a sign of love. Granted, being married to a Frenchie can be like starring in a US soap opera at times: big showdown rows, dramatic make-ups, the green-eyed monster always roaming.\nI discovered pretty quickly that the silent sulky treatment never works - they assume you're suffering with PMT.\nMy other half is also Latin - they are fiery. They blow hot and cold all the time. Like a kid's balloon, you let them deflate with a squeal and a load of hot air - and then you move on.\nAfter just 18 months of marriage, Cheryl and Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini (left) are said to be going their separate ways, whereas Samantha and Pascal Brick (right) have been happily married for eight years\nYou’ve probably already clocked that whether the French earn a thousand euros a month or €10,000 during those same four weeks - they don’t live and die by their career.\nIt is the law in France that no one works more than 35 hours a week. Why on earth did you take on the past-its-sell-by-date X Factor series when your place was with your husband?\nWhich brings me onto that well-known French saying about always being with your other half. The translation is roughly this: if you’re out of sight, then you’re out of mind and heart.\nI turn down work in London and Los Angeles on a regular basis because my place is with my husband at home in the Dordogne. The idea of hotfooting it to the opening of an envelope? Not ever gonna happen.\nIt has been reported that you did not learn to speak French, Cheryl. To my mind this is the real reason your marriage was doomed from the get-go.\n'If you’re out of sight, then you’re out of mind and heart': Samantha says she regularly turns down work commitments as her place is 'at home with her husband, 'at home in the Dordogne'\nThere are zero excuses either. Like you, I didn't go to a posh school with a fancy schmancy languages department.\nNeither did I have a highfalutin gap year in Paris. With my brummie accent it’s fair to say I possessed zero talent at picking up the local lingo either.\nBut I damn well knew that if I wanted my marriage to go the distance – I’d have to learn to be able to communicate with my husband, my step kids and my in-laws.\nYou know as well as I do Cheryl, it is the worse feeling in the world being unable to express your feelings, sentiments, and your point of view with someone you love.\nEven worse the French generally assume we’re thick as two short planks if we can't stand our ground in a discussion, much less indulge in general chitchat.\nCheryl's husband lost his father recently, an event which Samantha says should have prompted her to take some time off work and nurse him through his grief\nYour other half gets tired of translating for you, you're edged out of conversations, in other words when you're in their French world you might as well be stuck in a room with Ashley Cole’s pregnant partner. It’s intolerable right?\nOh sure, the first months of seduction are fine - you get through it with coquettish glances, clandestine physical gestures and sheer lust-fuelled attraction.\nBut when you have your first row and the inability to communicate rears its head. You don’t dash home to cuddle your dogs – you do as I did. Learn to communicate properly.\nIt takes hard graft. There are no expensive celebrity shortcuts to acquiring a foreign language. Is it harder for us? Yep. But is it satisfying? Oh yes.\n'A French husband is one-of-a-kind': Samantha says she's learned a lot about what French men want. She says she also made the effort to learn her husband's native tongue, which has helped the pair avoid rows\nThe pair married in 2014 after meeting in France and embarking on a three-month whirlwind romance\nI had lessons twice a week for two years, I listened to CDs in my car, I filled out notebooks full of exercises. My stepchildren loved pointing out my mistakes, too. Then there was the pillow talk…\nBut when you make improvements, there is nothing more satisfying than your husband praising your language prowess. It genuinely brought us close as a couple. How could it not?\nToday I speak the language fluently. It still makes my heart sing when the French (as one elderly gentleman did recently) comment on my excellent grasp of the language.\nPerhaps the main reason I’m getting a Team Jean-Bernard tee shirt printed up is this: your husband lost his father recently. Why didn’t you cancel your appearance on the X Factor and be with him, nursing him through his grief?\nCherly recently posted a selfie among rumours of an impending split from her husband Jean-Bernard\nSurely you realised that French children – even in adulthood – remain loyal and close to their families. I imagine your JB was devastated. Maybe you should have taken time out from your rapidly out-of-touch reality show klaxon and made it loud and clear about where your priorities are.\nI'd wager that if you put as much time into your marriage as you’ve put into your career you maybe wouldn't be looking for a divorce lawyer.\nIt appears to your cost, an alpha male Frenchman won't be pushed around to fit in with a dwindling talent show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3392639/SAMANTHA-BRICK-offers-honest-advice-Cheryl-Fernandez-Versini-amid-rumours-filing-divorce.html"}
