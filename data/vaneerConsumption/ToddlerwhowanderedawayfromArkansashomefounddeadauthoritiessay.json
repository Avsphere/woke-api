Rusty Johnson said the 2-year-old boy walked away from a house off Arkansas 45 between Hindsville and Clifty around 8 p.m. Tuesday. His body was found around 9:45 a.m. Wednesday.\nAdditional information regarding how far away the boy was located from his home was not immediately available.\nJohnson said about 200 searchers combied the area Wednesday morning looking for the boy, who was reportedly wearing only a diaper. Johnson said the rural area around the home has rolling pastures, some woods and a few minor bluff areas.\nMultiple law enforcement agencies spent the night and morning searching, Johnson said, noting some slept on concrete slabs or in cars, awakened and immediately began searching again.\nCheck back for updates on this story and read Thursday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/aug/24/crews-search-toddler-who-wandered-away-arkansas-ho/?page=1"}
