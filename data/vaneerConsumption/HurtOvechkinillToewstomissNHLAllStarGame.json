We have to make the right decision.\nAlex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals, pictured on January 27, 2016, will rest a nagging lower body injury instead of playing in the All-Star Game Â©Patrick Smith (Getty/AFP/File)\n\"If we want to get to where we want to get to, we can't do that without Ovie at 100 percent.\"\nToews will miss the annual mid-season clash of elite talent due to illness. The 27-year-old Canadian was pulled from the last period of a 5-0 loss Tuesday at Carolina due to illness.\n\"(Toews) remains symptomatic,\" Blackhawks team physician Michael Terry said Thursday. \"Rest over the break is most important for him to properly recover and be fully healthy heading into the rest of the season.\"\nNHL rules require players named to the All-Star Game who do not participate to miss his team's game before or after the contest, so Toews will miss Chicago's contest Tuesday against Colorado and Ovechkin will miss Washington's home game Tuesday against rival Eastern Conference division leader Florida.\n\"We have to pay a penalty for (Ovie missing the All-Star Game) and we're willing to do that,\" Trotz said.\n\"We believe it's better if he uses this time to heal and ideally be completely healthy for the duration of the season,\" Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said.\nA new All-Star Game format for this year features four teams, one from each NHL division, and 20-minute mini-games using 3-on-3 skaters and a goaltender.
