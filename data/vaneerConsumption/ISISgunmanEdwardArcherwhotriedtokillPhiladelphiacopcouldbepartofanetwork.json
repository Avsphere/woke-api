Hartnett is in a stable condition with a broken arm and nerve damage\nAfter shooting the officer again at point blank range the man, who pledged allegiance to ISIS, ran away\nCommissioner Richard Ross said on Saturday that there was no indication that Archer, from Philadelphia, was involved in a conspiracy, adding that the shooting was ‘an attempted assassination of a police officer’.\nArcher took a trip to Saudi Arabia in 2011 and one to Egypt in 2012, but he is not on a terror watch list, law enforcement sources told ABC.\nHartnett, who was wearing a bullet vest, was hit three times in his left arm, but miraculously got out of the car to continue shooting as the gunman ran away.\nIt has also been revealed that Archer, who has a criminal record, used a police handgun reported stolen in 2013.\nThe 30-year-old, who was also hit three times, was taken into custody shortly after the 11.30pm ambush.\nPolice Commissioner Richard Ross said Archer pledged allegiance ISIS and told investigators that he believed police defend laws that are contrary to Islam.\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat sworn in on less than a week ago, told reporters he did not believe Archer's actions reflected Islamic thinking.\n'In no way shape or form does anyone in this room believe that what was done represents Islam,' Kenney said.\nThe gunman looks back as he runs away from the scene - he was quickly apprehended by other officers\nAs the suspect escapes Hartnett gets out of his car and continues to fire\nAt a press conference today it was revealed the gunman, who has a criminal record, used a police handgun reported stolen in 2013. Pictured: The black, 9mm semiautomatic pistol\nHartnett, 33, is in a stable condition and underwent surgery early Friday at Presbyterian Hospital.\nRoss said: 'This is absolutely one of the scariest things I've ever seen.'\n'This guy tried to execute the police officer. The police officer had no idea he was coming.'\nHe said Hartnett was in his cruiser in West Philadelphia when the shooter approached from the sidewalk.\nHe then began firing, eventually shooting through the driver's-side window as he got closer.\n'I'm bleeding heavily!' Hartnett, a veteran of five years on the force, shouted into his police radio when he called in to report shots fired.\nThe suspect, who used a 9mm handgun, ran away but was quickly apprehended by other officers.\nRoss said the gunman, who wore a long white robe, used a gun that was stolen from the home of a police officer in 2013.\n'That is one of the things that you absolutely regret the most,' he said.\n'When an officer's gun is stolen and it's used against one of your own.'\nArcher's mother, Valerie Holliday, told The Philadelphia Inquirer he has been hearing voices recently and that family asked him to get help\nPolice Commissioner Richard Ross said: 'This is absolutely one of the scariest things I've ever seen'\nArcher's mother, Valerie Holliday, told The Philadelphia Inquirer he has been hearing voices recently and that family asked him to get help.\nShe also described him as devout Muslim.\nShe told Philly.com that he was one of seven children and that he had suffered head injuries from playing football and a moped accident.\n'He's been acting kind of strange lately. He's been talking to himself... laughing and mumbling,' Holliday said. 'He's been hearing voices in his head. We asked him to get medical help.'\nShe added that Archer believed he was targeted by police.\nThe officer's father, Robert Hartnett, said he spoke to his son after his surgery.\n'I love him and very proud of him. He's an excellent person,' Robert Hartnett said, reports 6ABC.\n'His spirits are positive,' Richard said, saying his spirits are positive, 'now that I see he's waking up. It will be a tough road. But he's a tough guy.'\nHartnett grew up in East Lansdowne with three siblings. He went from the Coast Guard to the police academy, according to 6ABC.\n'Jesse you're a super hero,' his sister-in-law Ashley Hartnett wrote on Facebook today.\nHartnett, 33, is in a stable condition and underwent surgery early Friday at Presbyterian Hospital\n'My brother in law, a police officer in West Philadelphia, was shot at 13 times point blank while sitting in his patrol car at a red light last night … But it's harder than that to take down a Hartnett.'\nPolice said they will not be releasing video of the attack out of respect for the officer and his family.\nJim Kenney, in his first week as mayor of the nation's fifth-largest city, said: 'There are just too many guns on the streets, and I think our national government needs to do something about that.'\nHis statement comes on the heels of President Barack Obama's announcement Tuesday of his plan to tighten gun control laws.\nUS officials have been on high security alert following a series of ISIS-linked attacks at home and abroad over the last few months.\nIn November, gunman and suicide bombers affiliated with Islamic State killed 130 people in a series of coordinated attacks in Paris. Last month a married couple fatally shot 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in an attack inspired by Islamic State militants.\nThose concerns have led to calls by some Republican governors and presidential hopefuls to restrict the admission of Syrian refugees fleeing that country's long civil war.\nIn New York City, where two police officers were shot dead in their patrol car in a December 2014 attack by a man angry over police killings of unarmed black men, the police department issued a memorandum urging officers to 'exercise heightened vigilance and implement proactive measures' in light of the Philadelphia shooting.\nHe said the officer was in his cruiser in West Philadelphia when the shooter approached from the sidewalk and began firing, eventually shooting through the driver's-side window as he got closer","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393362/Masked-ISIS-gunman-tried-execute-Philadelphia-cop-ambushing-car-hail-13-bullets-larger-radicalized-network.html"}
