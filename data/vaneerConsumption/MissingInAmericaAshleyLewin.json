In the morning, she was gone -- and she hasn't been heard from since.\nDespite her family's best efforts, Lewin, who was 15 when she disappeared, often communicated with older men she met online. Because of the nature of these conversations, Private Investigator Denise Savastano told Dateline that she fears that Lewin's disappearance may be related to human trafficking.\nNow 16-years-old, Lewin is 5’6” tall, weighs 180 pounds, and has brown eyes and brown hair.\nIf you have any information, please contact the Palmdale Sheriff's Station at (661) 272-2400 or Private Investigator Denise Savastano at (951) 544-5180.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/missing-in-america/missing-america-ashley-lewin-n120691"}
