In the heat of the moment I didn't realise he was badly hurt.\n'I wish him all the best and a speedy recovery.'\nDe Bruyne, who came on in the match as a second-half substitute, played significant role in City's 4-3 aggregate win.\nHaving lost the first-leg 2-1 at Goodison Park, City were 1-0 down in the return on 18 minutes with Ross Barkley netting for the visitors.\nFernandinho's deflected strike put City level before De Bruyne turned home Raheem Sterling's low pass across the box to put the hosts in front; although the England had run the ball out of play in the build up.\nOn 76 minutes, De Bruyne crossed for striker Sergio Aguero to score a third City goal and prevent the match from going to extra-time.\nDe Bruyne falls awkwardly following a tangle with Everton defender Ramiro Funes Mori\nRaheem Sterling's assist for De Bruyne's goal looked to have been run out of play in the build-up\nCity will now play Liverpool in the final at Wembley next month.\nManager Manuel Pellegrini is optimistic about how long De Bruyne will be sidelined for.\nHe told the BBC: 'I'm optimistic he won't be out for the rest of the season. We'll see how important the damage is. It's not the cruciate ligament.'\nThe Chilean went on: 'The doctor thinks, but he cannot be sure, that it's a problem in his medial ligament.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3420705/Joel-Robles-apologises-Kevin-Bruyne-suspecting-Manchester-City-star-time-wasting-lay-injured.html"}
