Prashant Kumar Pant, 50, was checking his land on Tuesday morning when he found Danielle McLaughlin's body. He said: 'I've felt very scared since. I haven't slept very well. I can no longer pass the area where the girl was found. I take a different route through my fields now.' Prashant said the area where the body was found was littered with empty crisp packets and empty bottles of Kingfisher beer. He also said there was evidence of urine and feaces nearby, which officers took away for testing. 'There were many things around her,' he said. 'The police searched the area and took it all away. There was also a gold locket near her too.' But Prashant, who owns a coconut and cashew nut plantation, remembered finding a crying young girl aged around 18-years-old running through his field two years ago. 'I was checking my fields for cattle again that time,' he said. 'When I saw this girl crying and running. I went to help her and she looked like she was on drugs. She was white but I don't know which country she was from. I called my relative as I didn't know what to do and she called the police. The police came and took her away. 'It saddens me that such things happen near my home. This is a lovely area but we have these tragic events that change our home town.'\nFollowing the reported crimes, police watched the flats and caught Bhagat who had been found guilty of seven previous offences.\nA worker at the Dreamcatcher resort where Danielle had reportedly visited the day before her murder said he knew of the arrested man and that he was 'the biggest thief of the area.'\n'He steals from foreigners only - break into their rooms and loot everything. He scares outsiders who have set up their business here. He is a powerful person, by powerful I mean he scares people using weapon. He is a nuisance for the society.'\nDetectives had earlier said they had questioned up to 15 people over the killing of Ms McLaughlin, who was travelling under a British passport.\nAccording to Goacom, a friend working in the accommodation business at nearby Agonda said Ms McLaughlin had arrived in the area from Arambol on Sunday and stayed with another friend.\nHe said she then told the friend she was going to meet some people she had met on a previous trip to the country who were going to help her find accommodation at Palolem.\nHeartbroken friends of the 28-year-old backpacker (above in a Facebook picture) say she 'added happiness' to the world\nIt is thought Ms McLaughlin (pictured) who had a tattoo saying 'Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery', lived in Liverpool, but may have been born in Ireland\nTHE LEAD UP TO VIKAT BHAGAT'S ARREST At 8.20am on Tuesday, police received information from Prashand Komarpant in Palolem, Canacona, about a body for a foreign female in an open field in Devabag, about 150m from a road leading from Canacona to Agonda. The woman had injuries on her face and head when her body was discovered. The body was identified as Danielle Mclaughlin by foreigners. She had arrived in Goa on February 23 and was staying in Arambol, but she had travelled to Festival Valley with a British friend on March 12 to stay with other foreigner friends over night. At about 1pm on March 13, Ms McLaughlin left Festival Valley and went to Palolem, where she was seen with 23-year-old Vikat Bhagat in Waddo Canacona. The pair were seen together on CCTV near a restaurant in Ourem. Miss McLaughlin was last seen with Bhagat at about 9.30pm on March 13, and was found dead the next day. Bhagat was arrested on March 14 at 3.10pm. His scooter allegedly had blood stains on it, as did his clothes. During a medical examination, officials found Bhagat had nail wounds. Bhagat has since confessed to killing Ms McLaughlin, saying he sexually assaulted her and disfigured her face with a beer bottle.\nThe friend said she had left at 2pm on Monday and was seen at a hotel in Palolem dancing with her Indian friends during Holi celebrations.\nPolice are studying the CCTV footage of all the shacks the victim visited on Monday night, and are working with teams of sniffer dogs and forensic teams.\nWhile the police found the deceased's clothes, they are yet to locate the murder weapon. The body has been sent to the Goa Medical College near Panaji for a post mortem.\nMs McLaughlin, who had a tattoo saying 'Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery', was born in Glasgow but grew up in County Donegal.\nHer Facebook profile says she had studied at Liverpool John Moores University.

Very grateful for all the beautiful pals I have accumulated in life,' she wrote.\nChristy Duffy, a close friend of Ms McLaughlin's from Buncrana, Donegal, has already raised several thousand euro on a fundraising website to help pay for the funeral and repatriation costs.\n'There's not really much anyone can say at the moment as I know we are all completely devastated,' he said.\n'There is nothing I need to say about Danielle as anyone who knew her, knew that she was a beautiful and kind-hearted, funny young lady who loved life and was a loyal and devoted friend, sister and daughter.\n'They say the brightest stars burn the quickest and no other analogy could describe Danielle's life better.'\nMr Duffy said the Irish embassy, the British embassy, the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust and many close friends are working hard on the arrangements to bring Ms McLaughlin's body home.\n'The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust have been brilliant and cover most arrangements and expenses, so basically this fundraiser is to help her family with the added costs of having someone with her when she returns and to give her the send-off she deserves,' he said.\nAnother Friend Candice Faulkner, who grew up with Danielle in the small town of Buncrana said on Facebook: 'We are in shock. Danielle was an amazing person with so much adventure in front of her. Our small town is devastated.'\nMYSTERIOUS DEATHS HAVE BLIGHTED BEACH HAVEN British schoolgirl Scarlett Keeling was found dead in Anjuna in mysterious circumstances in 2008 It is one of India's top tourism destinations with millions drawn by the promise of palm tree-fringed beaches and hedonistic parties. But the murder of 28-year-old Danielle McLaughlin is the latest case to blight picturesque Goa and its reputation as a holiday haven. In 2008, the body of British schoolgirl Scarlett Keeling was found bruised and semi-naked in shallow water in Anjuna, 70 miles from the spot where Ms McLaughlin was killed. The 15-year-old drowned after allegedly being plied with drugs - though her mother Fiona MacKeown has long insisted she was murdered. Goan police initially said her death was the result of an accidental drowning before two men went on trial for assaulting and killing her. But in September, Samson D'Souza and Placido Carvalho were cleared in an Indian court. Mackeown said yesterday that she was not surprised by Danielle's murder. The mother from Bideford, North Devon said: 'This story reinforces my belief that Goa is a dangerous place to visit. 'Scarlett's murder was covered up and I hope this one isn't. People are already comparing the two cases. It should put more pressure on the government to clean up the area. 'If they don't do something, tourists will not feel safe to come to Goa. In my case, the court revealed they did not do a proper investigation. Two years after Scarlett's death, in 2010, another mysterious death took place. Edinburgh-born Denyse Sweeney was 34 when she collapsed outside a bar in Anjuna. She was declared dead at hospital less than an hour later. An Indian post mortem result put her cause of death down to a drugs overdose and said the evidence pointed to it being an accidental death. But in 2012, an inquest in Derby heard that there were no drugs in the mother of two's system. There were 20 unexplained marks on her body. The tests in the UK showed that she had in fact died from a head injury. The family campaigned for a new investigation in India. But detectives from India's Central Bureau of Investigation later dropped the probe, insisting there was no evidence of violence. Her sister Maureen said afterwards that she still believed Denyse had been murdered. Edinburgh-born Denyse Sweeney (pictured) was 34 when she collapsed outside a bar in Anjuna. She was declared dead at hospital less than an hour later According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, between 2010 and 2014, 58 British nationals died in Goa in what are described as 'unknown' circumstances. And seven foreigners, including four women, were murdered in Goa between 2013 and February 2016, according to a local paper. Half a million holidaymakers – including more than 100,000 Britons – visit Goa each year, enticed by the Indian state’s cheap deals and winter sun. Its golden beaches, laid-back vibe and abundance of cheap drugs, make the former Portuguese colony a destination favoured by hippies and backpackers. But the murder of Danielle McLaughlin has again exposed a menacing undercurrent. The seedy side of Goa was depicted in a controversial 2011 Bollywood thriller which had a trailer with the line: ‘Here in Goa, liquor is cheap but girls are even cheaper.’ Tourist chiefs have desperately attempted to downplay the image – and tried to get the film banned – but Goa has developed a reputation for police corruption, extortion and sex attacks which allegedly involve a drug mafia with links to top politicians. Goa’s reputation as a bohemian paradise was sealed in the Sixties when hippies went there in search of peace, love and hashish. But the rise of harder drugs – including heroin, ecstasy and cocaine – has had often devastating consequences (file picture) Foreign Office advice features a stark warning to British travellers heading to Goa. It states: ‘There have been reports of drinks being spiked and travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, sexually assaulted or dying. 'There have also been reports of locals posing as police officers or government officials in order to extort money, so be alert if approached. Avoid beaches after dark.’ It also warns of reports of bag snatchings on smaller roads in some of the main tourist areas, with thieves ‘with headlights on full-beam to blind their victims’. It adds: ‘The possession or consumption of drugs is illegal and conviction for either offence may lead to a very long prison sentence. A number of British nationals in Goa die each year due to drug or alcohol abuse.’ Goa’s reputation as a bohemian paradise was sealed in the Sixties when hippies went there in search of peace, love and hashish. But the rise of harder drugs – including heroin, ecstasy and cocaine – has had often devastating consequences. Stories abound of travellers being fleeced – and sometimes sexually assaulted – in coordinated scams between drug dealers and police in resorts where hotel rooms cost as little as £20 a night. It usually involves a proposed sale of cheap drugs to naive young tourists on the beach. But police arrive and threaten the buyer with jail unless they pay the officers a hefty bribe – some of which is given to the dealer – or provide sexual favours.\nAnd another friend of the family, Ruth Taylor said: 'My brain won't let it register!! Our poor Danielle, it's such a shock, I'm heartbroken!'\nDanielle had been travelling the world, meeting up with friends as she went.\nShe had lived in Liverpool for many years, and had worked in the Pump House Bar on the Albert Dock before going travelling.\nThe firm said on Facebook: 'Very sad to hear we have lost one of our old team members Danielle McLaughlin in Goa this week. She was only 28. Goodbye Danielle. Deepest condolences to her family in Ireland.'\nThe Irish Independent quotes Rena Donaghey, a councillor in the Buncrana area as saying the death had left the whole community 'in deep shock'\n'Everyone is very saddened by the news. She was a lovely young woman who has come to a very sad end. She was very popular and very liked in the community. She headed off on a backpacking holiday in February to do some travelling.\n'On behalf of the community, I would like to offer sympathy and condolences. I hope God will give the family strength at this tragic time to help them through the weeks and months ahead.'\nPolice are also studying the CCTV footage of all the shacks the victim visited on Monday night, and are working with teams of sniffer dogs and forensic teams (file picture)\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin earlier confirmed it was talking to its embassy in India about the reports.\nThe Irish embassy said: 'Ireland's Embassy in New Delhi is in contact with Indian authorities in relation to reports of an incident involving an Irish citizen.\n'The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stands ready to provide consular assistance.'\nBut the Department later said it was 'following up on the suspected murder of an Irish woman in Goa' who had been 'using a British passport'.\n'It has been confirmed that the woman travelled to India using a British passport, so the local British consulate have the lead responsibility in terms of dealings with the Indian authorities,' the spokesman added.\n'The Irish Embassy is liaising closely with the British authorities and an Irish consular official is travelling from New Delhi to Goa today.'\nAn FCO spokesperson said: 'We are supporting the family of a British-Irish woman following her death in Goa, India. Our thoughts are with them at this very difficult time. Indian police are conducting an investigation and we are in close contact with them.'\nIn 2008, British teenager Scarlett Keeling (left) was found dead on Goa's popular Anjuna beach.
