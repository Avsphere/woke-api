He was last seen in an official photograph distributed in mid-December.\nFew details concerning his health are given out by the palace.\nBut on Sunday it issued an update reporting that the king's pulse and blood pressure had returned to normal after he was given antibiotics to fight an infection and fever.\nIn September the palace released a video of the monarch in a wheelchair, looking visibly weakened, visiting a shop in the hospital.\nMost Thais have only known King Bhumibol on the throne and anxiety over the future once his six-decade reign ends is seen as an aggravating factor in Thailand's bitter political divide.\nThailand has been roiled by a decade of political protests, street violence and coups.\nThe military took over in May 2014 following months of protests that led to the toppling of Yingluck Shinawatra's democratically elected government.\nThe political conflict broadly pits a Bangkok-based middle class and royalist elite, backed by parts of the military and judiciary, against rural and working-class voters loyal to Yingluck and her brother Thaksin, who was also deposed in a coup in 2006.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393820/Frail-Thai-king-briefly-leaves-Bangkok-hospital.html"}
