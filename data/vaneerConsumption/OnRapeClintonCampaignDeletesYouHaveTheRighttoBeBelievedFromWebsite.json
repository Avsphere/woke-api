You have the right to be heard. You have the right to be believed, and we’re with you,” Clinton said in September 2015.\nThat quote was featured on the campaign website, according to Reddit user “goonsack” but the line “you have the right to be believed” has since been deleted.\n“Goonsack” asked Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick to comment on the edit during a Reddit AMA.\n“Do you think the fact that Hillary’s people changed the quote on her Campus Sexual Assault issue website had anything to do with you and other women who have credible claims against her husband?” the Reddit user asked.\n“Definitely. They all knew she had goofed,” Broaddrick replied.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/08/15/rape-clinton-campaign-deletes-right-believed-website/"}
