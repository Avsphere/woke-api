The big game-changer is that we are using much higher-frequency bands than previously thought viable for flexible uses, including mobile.”\nVerizon and AT&T have said they will begin deploying 5G trials in 2017, and the first commercial deployments at scale are expected in 2020, Wheeler said. T Mobile US, a unit of Deutsche Telecom (DTE:ETR), and Sprint Corp (S:NYSE) are also undertaking trials.\nThe FCC said the key to 5G is developing new rules that balance spectrum use between new wireless services, satellite operations and federal government use. Boeing Corp (BA:NYSE) told the FCC last week that the company and “the rest of the satellite industry have supported common-sense rules that would promote true sharing.”\nThe FCC will make spectrum available and rely on a process led by the private sector for producing technical standards.\nFCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel commented, “We are on the cusp of cars that drive themselves, streets that can be safer, emergency services that are more effective, healthcare that is more personalized, and more capability across the board because we are more connected.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2016/07/15/5g-approved-fcc-100-times-faster-4g/"}
