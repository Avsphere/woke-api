That a barely literate clown (literally) such as Obedeillah would be given a platform to spew his bile speaks to the low and degraded state of “journalism” in post-America America. Obeidallah is hardly alone. He is but one in an army of Goebbels-inspired goose-steppers waging a stealth jihad and exploiting a sharia-compliant media that is hell-bent on destroying freedom and Americanism.\nThe Daily Beast’s smear piece is entitled, “So Now Muslims Can Be Fired for Praying?” In it, he gives a false reconstruction of events: “A Cargill plant in Colorado had always permitted its Muslim employees prayer breaks. But why were 190 of them suddenly fired?” In reality, Cargill has been exceedingly generous to the Muslim workers. Despite the fact that Cargill was accommodating the vast majority of Muslim daily prayer requests by providing specially created “reflection rooms,” i.e., prayer rooms, 190 Muslim workers walked off the job. The Beast’s beast Obeidallah neglects to mention that.\nObeidallah whines: “If 190 Christians were fired en masse from their jobs for wanting to pray for a few minutes, there would be outrage! Franklin Graham would be screaming from the rooftops. Fox News would break into its coverage of Christian victimization to do a special report on it. And, of course, GOP presidential candidates like Ted Cruz would be calling this a ‘jihad’ on Christians, just as he has used that term to attack LGBT advocates of marriage equality.”\nBut Christians do not make such outrageous requests. Christians do not walk off the job in the name of Jesus. Christians do not impose their religion on their co-workers. Christians don’t ask for special chapel rooms, or footbaths and the like.\n“But when 190 Muslims were fired from their jobs in Colorado a few weeks ago for simply wanting to take short prayer breaks,” Obeidallah continues, “we didn’t hear a peep from these so-called advocates of religious liberty.”\nObeidallah doesn’t mention that these Muslim workers don’t have to pray at those times. They can make up the missed prayers later. They don’t stop production lines in Iran and other Muslim countries for prayer. This demand at Cargill is a way of imposing Islam on the kuffar. The Muslim workers are demanding special rights that the non-Muslims don’t have. Special rights for a special class — that is sharia. Muslims are superior – that’s sharia. And once they get their prayer breaks, they will take their demands to the next level, as they did at Hertz. At Hertz, Muslim workers demanded prayer breaks; Hertz agreed. But Muslims were disappearing during prayer breaks. Hertz responded by asking them only to clock in and out during prayer times. Muslims refused, and now Hertz is being sued for religious intolerance.\nObeidallah then claims that a recent poll “found that 82 percent of Americans believe preserving religious liberty for Christians was important,” while “only 61 percent said the same about Muslim’s rights to practice their faith. (That number was even lower among Republicans.)” He wants to talk polls? Fine. Let’s talk about polls of America Muslims who want to impose the sharia in America. According to a recent poll, 58% of US Muslims reject First Amendment criticism of Islam as a right. 46% want blasphemy punished, 12% want them killed.\nObdeillah speaks of religious liberty when there is no such liberty for non-Muslims and religious minorities who live under Islamic law in Muslim countries. On the contrary, there is not a single Muslim country in the world in which non-Muslims enjoy completely equal rights with Muslims. Obeidallah brings up the Civil Rights Act of 1964: “This iconic law states, among other things, that employers are required to provide a ‘reasonable accommodation’ so that employees can practice his or her faith.” The ironic thing is that no such civil rights exist in Muslim countries. Muslims in the U.S. enjoy more freedoms than they do in Muslim countries.\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), says Obeidallah “has provided a few examples of typical religious accommodations.” It has done much more than that: the EEOC has become the pro-sharia Obama administration’s battering ram against companies, forcing them to adhere to sharia principles. The overreach of the EEOC is monstrous: one particularly extreme example of its interference was its support of two Muslim truck drivers who were suing the company that dismissed them for refusing to transport alcohol; they were awarded $240,000 for this refusal to do the job for which they had been hired.\nObeidallah continues: “Still at the end of the day there are 190 Muslims, mostly United States citizens, who were fired because of their desire to practice to faith and take two to three short breaks during the day to pray.” No, they were fired because they walked off the job and refused to work and behave like everyone else in America. Cargill doesn’t discriminate against Muslims: a Cargill spokesperson said that “our Muslim employees are still taking prayer breaks at work.”\nObeidallah says: “From an outsider’s point of view, you would think this would be an easy to case resolve. But as former trial lawyer I can tell you that this is a typical scenario where the parties are not that far apart but still a resolution can’t be reached.” In reality, they couldn’t be farther apart. What Obdeillah is saying is, submit or pay the price of extortion, libel, and smear.\nRead the chapter titled “Mosqueing the Workplace” in my book Stop the Islamization of America to better understand this de facto imposition of sharia in America. It always works the same way: every accommodation gives way to more demands. Everywhere American practices conflict with sharia, it is our practices that must give way. Muslims impose their work times, their sharia on non-Muslim coworkers, and punish companies that refuse to submit. Litigation jihad is a huge industry, and American companies are being held hostage by Muslim workers.\nIt’s time to call a halt, and to say that there will be no more accommodation. We must start standing up for our own principles – and calling out the Daily Beast and sharia goons like Dean Obeidallah for working so hard to undermine them.\nPamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.
