'I would like to work with him over a longer period. We learned a lot from him and he is improving each player.\n'But it is not over yet. We have around six months to go and we have to enjoy this time with him and try to be successful.'\nAsked if the mood behind the scenes had changed, Robben answered sarcastically: 'Yeah, it is totally different. He is not fully committed any more.\n'No, it is not different. I think we have too much experience. In this business it is usual. Players come and go and that goes for coaches as well. We have to continue our work.\n'We just have one goal and that goal is to be successful. We have to focus on that.'\nRobben (pictured signing autographs in Doha on Sunday) took part in a first-team training session\nRobben insists the mood had not been affected by Guardiola's decision to leave at the end of this season\nHis Bayern team-mate Jerome Boateng felt the same and added: 'When I was younger I also wanted to go to England. That's different for every player.\n'Some just want to stay in the same country all the time. I think you have to respect that and it's totally understandable.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3393813/Arjen-Robben-insists-mood-Bayern-Munich-not-changed-despite-Pep-Guardiola-s-decision-leave-England.html"}
