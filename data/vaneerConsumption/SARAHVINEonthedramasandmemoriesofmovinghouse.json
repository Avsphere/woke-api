Well, almost a lifetime: 15 years to be precise.\nWhen my husband and I first walked through the front door of our house in West London, we knew it was the one for us.\nBack then, we were thirtysomething newlyweds, a couple of stone lighter and with very little baggage — emotional, political or otherwise.\nNow, as we prepare to close it behind us for the very last time —we are moving home in a few days — we find ourselves rather more encumbered. Two children, two dogs, a hamster... and the many ghosts of the life that we have built together.\nWhen my husband and I first walked through the front door of our house in West London, we knew it was the one for us, but now it's time to move on\nSo many memories — happy, sad, bittersweet — come tumbling down through the years, collecting at my feet as I pack up the detritus of this little universe of ours.\nLying on the sofa, for example, heavily pregnant with my daughter, watching Buffy The Vampire Slayer and eating Green & Black’s almond chocolate; bringing this tiny, furious, purple-faced creature home in her car seat and wondering what on earth I was going to do with it; waking in the dead of night to find her staring intently at me with all the wisdom of the world in those beady newborn eyes.\nI remember my son, now a gangly teenager, as a butterball toddler, lining up his toy cars bumper to bumper with solemn concentration and sighing with quiet satisfaction as he surveyed his work.\nLater, watching him as he slept in the little box room, fat fingers clutching his blanket, eyes flickering beneath the dark sweep of his lashes as he dreamed his baby dreams.\nThen there was the time my daughter threw a rock up in the air to see if it would bounce, and it came down and hit her straight between the eyes.\nI ran with her in my arms all the way to the local cottage hospital and sat there feeling like the worst mother in the world as an egg-size bump appeared on her forehead.\nMemories of my son, falling over at his favourite soft-play centre and splitting his cheek open, having it stitched up at the surgery and then coming home and straight away tripping over the front door mat, re-opening the freshly dressed wound.\nI remember Michael coming home with his first red box, having just been appointed Education Secretary in the Coalition Cabinet\nThat raised a few eyebrows from the nurses, I can tell you.\nOf our first dog Mars, who got run over. Neither of my children had seen me cry before.\nThey stared in fascination as I picked him off the side of the road and wept uncontrollably over his little body, still warm, but lifeless in my arms.\nSmall family dramas all, playing like tiny cine films in the silent theatre of my mind’s eye.\nTaking me back to the day when, after months of diligent stalking, Mars finally saw his chance and pounced on my daughter’s first hamster (there have been several over the years).\nHe snapped its spine in his powerful Jack Russell jaws in front of a horrified group of small girls, all of whom burst into tears.\nI remember the winter I, too, shattered a few bones of my own, snapping my wrist and dislocating my hand after slipping on ice in the park, passing out briefly and then walking slowly home, zombie-like, as the adrenaline buzzed in my ears.\nI pressed the doorbell. ‘Who is it?’ a little voice asked.\nSo many memories — happy, sad, bittersweet — come tumbling down through the years, collecting at my feet as I pack up the detritus of this little universe of ours\n‘It’s Mummy and I’ve broken my arm,’ I said.\nAt first they thought I was joking, but then the ambulance was called and I sat in the front room, being injected with morphine, while the paramedics tractioned it back into place.\nAnd then there were the playdates, the dinners, the parties and, of course, the friends. Good friends we still have and good friends — as the man said — we have lost along the way. Those, sadly, I shall leave behind.\nMost of all, though, there’s my dear husband, who loved this house from the moment he first set foot in it, with its World War II Anderson shelter in the back garden and its Hobbit- like proportions.\nFor me, having grown up in Italy surrounded by all the beauty of that wonderful country, our home’s Thirties aesthetic was distinctly lacking in appeal (yes, I freely admit it, I am an architecture snob).\nBut he, being more heart than head, adored it. I could see it reminded him of his parents’ house in Aberdeen, a simple, unpretentious home that could — and would — become his refuge from the world. Because however mad things were on the outside, Michael always knew he could rely on there being a simple domestic calm within (well, most of the time).\nI remember him coming home with his first red box, having just been appointed Education Secretary in the Coalition Cabinet.\nIt sat there, grand and intimidating, on the coffee table in front of our sofa, about as unlikely an object for that location as a diamond tiara or a stuffed swan.\nAs the years wore on, we got used to having the box around. It even had its own Government driver, travelling in air- conditioned splendour to and from the department.\nAt the end of each day — often he would not be home until after 11pm — my husband would sit in his favourite armchair with a cup of tea or a glass of wine (depending on the day’s vicissitudes) and work his way through the Civil Service submissions.\nHe would have one ear tuned to the news, another listening to me prattling on about children and work and gossip, humming to himself as the stress and strain of Government temporarily subsided.\nLater, after the EU referendum was called and he made his decision to campaign for Brexit, the madness and divisions of politics came calling at our front door.\nOne night, presumably after a tip-off, a photographer was spotted lurking outside by my daughter and her two friends, who were round for a sleepover. They came rushing down in their night clothes to warn our distinguished guests, who were about to leave.\nLater, after the EU referendum was called and he made his decision to campaign for Brexit (pictured at a polling station after casting our votes)\n‘Don’t worry!’ the girls said. ‘We’ll create a diversion and he won’t get anywhere near you.’ And so they did, shooting out of the front door and pouncing on the poor snapper. Assaulted by three 13-year-old girls, he did the only sane thing, and ran away.\nIt was last November that we finally realised we needed to move on. Now, as I write, the carpets are rolled up and I am running down the food stocks.\nMy daughter is excited, already planning her new route to school and fresh sleepover opportunities.\nMy son, like all boys, is wary of change, but provided I can recreate his room in almost exact detail in the new house, I think he’ll come round to the idea. Maybe.\nAs for me, I haven’t really had time to think. But my subconscious clearly has because for the past few weeks I’ve been having the oddest dreams.\nIt’s as though my mind, by day focused on cleaning out cupboards and packing boxes, is by night conducting its own internal emotional audit, parcelling up the events of the past years and putting them neatly away in readiness for the next chapter of our lives.\nSo many memories, so many plots and plans, dramas and dreams, mistakes and triumphs.\nNow it’s time to let another family write their story within these four walls...\nCatherine Zeta Jones at the premiere of Dad's Army last year\nZeta's magic isn't working on me\nForget selfies; it’s all about the shelfie these days, aka offering your loyal social media followers a glimpse into your most private of privates, aka the contents of your bathroom cabinet.\nThe latest to spill the face creams, as the Mail revealed yesterday, is Catherine Zeta-Jones, a compatriot of mine from the lovely seaside town of Mumbles.\nAnd there, sadly, the similarities end. For while Zeta-Jones is a famous beauty married to an iconic Hollywood film star, I am — well, not.\nStill, I’m happy to see we share a passion for Charlotte Tilbury’s Charlotte’s Magic Cream.\nThough the magic seems to be working rather better on Ms Zeta-Jones than on me...\nWhy is it that the London Marathon always makes me go a bit lemony? Don’t get me wrong: I love the sight of a pantomime horse galloping around Canary Wharf as much as the next person, and the heart-warming stories of triumph over adversity.\nBut there is something about the saturation coverage of people in Lycra boring on about their PBs (that’s personal bests, in case you weren’t aware) that makes me long for the days when it was a running race instead of a rally for virtue-signalling do-gooders.\nMaitlis manipulated\nSheryl Sandberg, CEO of Facebook, played a blinder during her Newsnight appearance on Monday.\nInterviewed by Emily Maitlis, she gave a moving account of how she had coped with personal tragedy following the sudden death of her husband, fighting back the tears just enough to get her point across, but not so as to spoil her maquillage.\nShe perhaps thought that, after all that, it would have seemed a little insensitive of Maitlis to press her on fake news and the recent murder, broadcast on Facebook live, of a wholly innocent man.\nOr, for that matter, pornography and fundamentalist rhetoric appearing alongside adverts for everyday household essentials.\nAnd so, obligingly, Maitlis didn’t — and Facebook won again.\nOpen your minds, sisters\nThe TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale has not yet hit our screens (it premieres tonight), yet already the Snowflake Sisters are crying foul.\nApparently, Elizabeth Moss, who plays the lead character, is not being sufficiently sisterly in her appreciation of the novel, having claimed that it is ‘not a feminist story’.\nShe is right, of course, as anyone who has actually read the book knows.\nApparently, Elizabeth Moss, who plays the lead character, is not being sufficiently sisterly in her appreciation of the novel, having claimed that it is ‘not a feminist story’\nIt’s far more complex than that, a dark dystopian tale full of ambiguity where all the characters, male and female, are struggling to survive in a brutal climate of fundamentalist oppression. Sometimes I wonder: do any of these young women who protest so loudly know how to think for themselves?\nOr do they just get all their intellectual nourishment streamed directly into their tiny closed minds from Twitter?\nIsn’t the whole point of a girl band the fact that you look sensational in underwear and make all the dads feel deeply conflicted about the prospect of accompanying their teenage daughters to your concerts?\nIn that respect, wild-haired Eighties talent vacuums Bananarama were legendary.\nSo why spoil happy memories by announcing a comeback tour more than 30 years on?\nI just hope the organisers have good wheelchair access and plenty of defibrillators.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-4445916/SARAH-VINE-dramas-memories-moving-house.html"}
