Delayed cord clamping. Early attachment; in union doctor and patient can achieve a birth that is respectful.'\nThe clip showed the gentle removal of each limb as the baby was slowly pulled from the womb by the hands of the doctors.\nMs Gallo wrote she could 'feel the connection' between everyone in the room, before issuing a call to arms.\nSlowly but surely: The clip shows doctors slowly easing the baby boy out of the womb limb by limb using their hands\n'Know better, ask for better': Ms Gallo said all c-sections could be performed in this manner, as opposed to a more 'clinical, rushed, hardlined' birth\n'I wish this was available for everyone - please mamas, changes like this are entirely consumer driven,' she wrote.\n'Know better, ask for better, set a better standard for birthing people worldwide.\n'Birth does not need to be clinical, rushed hard lined and full of rough handling... let's make cesarean birth a special place because all birth deserves to be and feel beautiful for baby, mama and family too.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4318096/Australian-doula-shares-video-caesarean-birth.html"}
