In an average of 7.6 out of 12 tries, the dogs went right to the food-containing box. When the experimenter directed his or her voice to the back wall instead of toward either container, the dogs could not accurately guess the location of the food.\nThese results were as good or better than those seen in previous research with human infants, the researchers reported Tuesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\nWas this talent learned or innate? To find out, the researchers recruited 16 puppies, ages 8 to 14 weeks, and subjected them to the same test. The puppies found the food an average of 8.1 out of every 12 tries.\nAdult dogs tended to use the voice cue correctly from the beginning, performing just as well on their first try as on their last. Puppies often took a few tries to catch on. The puppies that had experienced more socialization with humans did better than those with limited human interactions.\n\"It is likely that the skill reported in this study is learned, though very quickly and through a minimal amount of exposure to humans,\" the researchers wrote.\nâ€” Stephanie Pappas, LiveScience\nThis is a condensed version of a report from LiveScience.
