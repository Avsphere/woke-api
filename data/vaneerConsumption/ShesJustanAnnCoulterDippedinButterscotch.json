Doesn’t she know that the Fox network is using her? She’s just an Ann Coulter dipped in butterscotch. That’s all she is. Baby, don’t let them use you! Come back to the black people.”\nHe added: “Get back to work in some of the beautiful C movies that you used to do. I promise I will see them.”\nAnderson also said in his monologue, “Look at all of these beautiful shades of people in the audience… Hollywood needs to know that this is what diversity is supposed to look like.”\nDash responded on Twitter Friday night:\nWell it's funny how woman who weighs 105 wet!\nCan get grown ass men to act like llittle girls! Haha — Stacey Dash (@REALStaceyDash) February 6, 2016\nDash said in January it is “ludicrous” for black entertainers to call for a boycott of the Oscars while still supporting the BET and NAACP Awards, which only recognize black artists.\n“Either we want to have segregation or integration,” Dash said on Fox and Friends.“If we don’t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NCAAP] Image Awards where you’re only awarded if you’re black. If it were the other way around, we’d be up in arms.”\nShe added: “It’s a double standard… Just like there shouldn’t be a black history month. We’re Americans, period.”\nThe actress made the comments in regards to a growing boycott of the 88th Academy Awards by numerous prominent black entertainers, after the Academy announced all the acting nominations went to white actors for the second consecutive year.\nWatch a clip of the Image Awards below.
