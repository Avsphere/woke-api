I think she’ll have to actually publicly address it on the campaign trail, but then I think she moves on. She’s had a considerable amount of momentum over the last week from Elizabeth Warren to President Obama to Joe Biden, and Trump continues to double down on his own comments about the judge, Judge Curiel. So when those things are happening, she’s in a place of strength, and I think the worst thing she could do is ignore this and allow it to build up, where it looks like a bigger deal than it is,” Hill said.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/06/11/marc-lamont-hill-worst-thing-hillary-could-do-is-ignore-donor-controversy/"}
