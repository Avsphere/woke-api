(AP) — For the second time in a week, police in Wisconsin have recovered a stolen load of cheese worth tens of thousands of dollars.\nMarshfield Police Lt. Darren Larson says 41,000 pounds of parmesan cheese worth $90,000 was stolen from a Marshfield distributor Jan. 15. A semi picked up the cheese that day, but it never reached its intended destination in Illinois.\nLarson says investigators received a tip Thursday that the cheese was likely in Grand Chute. Police in Grand Chute found the entire shipment intact. It had already been unloaded into a warehouse.\nOn Monday, police in Germantown said $70,000 worth of cheddar and other cheeses stolen from a distribution center there last week had been recovered in Milwaukee on Friday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422070/Wisconsin-police-recover-load-stolen-cheese.html"}
