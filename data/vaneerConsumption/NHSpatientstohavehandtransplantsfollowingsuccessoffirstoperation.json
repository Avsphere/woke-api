If we got a suitable donor, we could operate this afternoon.\n'Three of the four people on our waiting list have lost both hands and both feet and so are very dependent. A successful hand transplant would give them their life back.\n'There have been lots of hand transplants around the world but this is the first time a national funding organisation has closely examined the issue, come up with the conclusion and is now going to fund in nationally in one centre.'\nDr Jonathan Fielden, NHS England's director of specialised commissioning, said: 'The NHS is leading the world in offering this cutting-edge procedure.'\nMr Cahill, of West Yorkshire, whose new hand has almost 100 per cent function, said: 'My experience as a patient and my quality of life since the hand transplant has been fantastic.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3421947/Four-patients-given-new-hands-NHS-Victims-accidents-severe-infections-transplants-following-success-operation.html"}
