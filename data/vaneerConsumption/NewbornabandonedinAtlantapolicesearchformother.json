Celeste Murphy told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nThe baby was taken to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Scottish Rite to be checked out, and is in “good, healthy condition this morning,” Murphy said. “Healthy weight, she was alert, pretty much no health ailments that we know of today. She’s doing well breathing on her own, eating well – a beautiful baby.”\nMurphy said police are concerned for the mother’s well-being.\n“We have a mother that just had a baby that may not have sought medical attention, and we have a concern about that as well,” Murphy said. “We want to make sure that she seeks medical attention.”\nShe said officers have canvassed the neighborhood, “interviewing people in the area, seeing if anyone has seen or knows of anyone who might have possibly, just recently birthed a child.”\nMurphy said the mother didn’t have to abandon the baby on a stranger’s doorstep.\n“Up to seven days old, any child can be left with any medical facility and there are no criminal repercussions for that,” she said.\n“So if there’s anyone out there in a similar situation, we want to get the message out to you that there are answers,” Murphy said. “You don’t have to suffer in silence. You can let people know that you just need help with your baby.”\nMurphy said she didn’t know if the mother, if located, will face charges.\nPolice asked that anyone with information on the child or mother call the department’s Special Victim’s Unit at 404-546-4260, or leave an anonymous tip through Crime Stoppers at 404-577-TIPS.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/newborn-abandoned-atlanta-police-search-for-mother/o5FAnSIHfDj3SAg1fpGvQI/"}
