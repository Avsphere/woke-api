Brookhaven, Dunwoody and Tucker have incorporated since 2008, and the city of Stonecrest will open for business this year.\nThe lasting effects of the recession that began in late 2007 also played a role. While property values have rebounded in developed city areas, blight has remained more of a challenge in some unincorporated regions.\nDeKalb CEO Mike Thurmond wrote in his budget proposal last month that reducing blight to preserve property values will be one of his priorities.\nOverall, those who live in cities made up 53 percent of the county’s tax digest in 2016, while property owners in unincorporated areas accounted for the other 47 percent.\nThe DeKalb Commission plans to vote on the county’s $1.3 billion annual budget by the end of this month.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/cities-surpass-the-rest-dekalb-property-value/jCr7yEDnewt3kInR9z2ifI/"}
