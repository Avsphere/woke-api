Sidney Allen said in an email.\nGeorge was arrested about 1:15 a.m. Tuesday, after officers responded to a residential alarm at 1300 Jones St. When police arrived, two officers checked the perimeter of the house in the backyard while two other officers walked to the south side of the home.

The Little Rock Police Department said Hughes and an unidentified woman had attempted to rob a woman outside the Park Plaza Mall about 12:40 p.m. Sunday, but the victim resisted and held on to her possessions, ArkansasOnline previously reported.\n\"These same suspects then went to the Breckenridge area and successfully robbed two people\" at gunpoint, Allen said Monday. Hughes was charged Monday in that robbery.\nGeorge is being held in the Pulaski County jail in lieu of $1,500 bond on a failure-to-appear charge; and her bail is not yet set on the new charges.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/may/05/second-suspect-lr-mall-robbery-arrested/?page=1"}
