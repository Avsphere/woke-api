But we had difficulty with his behaviour at home. He became argumentative and angry and accused us of being unfair.'\nThe inquest heard that the day before Leo died, he argued with his parents over watching an episode of the television series, 24.\nThe following day he was in a mood and in the evening he argued over trying on new clothes for his holiday. He stormed upstairs and was found hanging 20 minutes later.\nThe inquest had also heard evidence from a friend at Beverley Grammar School, East Yorkshire, explaining how another boy at the school targeted them, claiming his Satanic beliefs allowed him to hurt people.\nA mother of one of his friends criticised the school for how the alleged bullying was handled\nThe teenage friend said in his statement: 'There was a boy at school who claimed to be a Satanist. He targeted a few people at school, including me and Leo.\n'He would put his arm around our necks and pull us to the ground or push us into a bush.'\nHe added: 'There were also Facebook messages from the boy calling Leo names.'\nThe friend said Leo was a Buddist, which made him 'more tolerant and kind than most people'. He added: 'In some ways he was too gentle,.'\nThe mother of Leo's friend criticised the school over how it dealt with the alleged bullying and communicated with Leo's parents.\nIn a statement, she told the inquest: 'When a pupil claims to be a Satanist you would expect alarm bells to ring at the school.\n'But Leo's family didn't know about this until I told them and his mum was distraught.\n'They are a family searching for answers and it shouldn't have been my responsibility to tell them about this.\nClaims bullying had led to his actions were dismissed by Detective Constable Claire Burnett.\nShe told the hearing: 'I spoke with the school and they said that there had been minor disruptions in the classroom but nothing that would signify bullying.\n'Leo never told his parents about the comments, even his teachers, or even his best friend.\n'I would say the comments would be not out of sorts with what is said in conversation among students at an all boy's school.'\nOn two previous occasions, Leo had expressed suicidal thoughts, the inquest heard.\nOn the first occasion, he was found with a belt around his neck following an argument with his parents and on the second occasion, he had an argument in the car and later said he wondered what it would be like to jump out of the car while it was still moving.\nA friend of Leo's said that as well as the school bullying, messages were posted on Facebook about him\nLeo was referred to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in 2013.\nMental health nurse Alison Potts had a three-hour meeting with Leo and his mother Louise.\nMs Potts said: 'Leo denied having suicidal thoughts. He only said he wanted to die when he was angry and upset but did not mean it.\n'I did not identify any mental health conditions and discharged him from the service.'\nDespite this, Leo's father Mr Street feels more could have been done.\nHe said: 'We have struggled to come to terms with his death. We feel let down by social services and we turned to them for help on numerous occasions.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422716/Schoolboy-14-hanged-bullied-Satanist-fellow-pupil.html"}
