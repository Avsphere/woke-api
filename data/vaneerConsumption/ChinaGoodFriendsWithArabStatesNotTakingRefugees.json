There is a golden opportunity to have China experience the joy of exchanging people and culture by taking in a few hundred thousand of those Syrian refugees. It seems unfair of the Western world to hoard all that cultural exchange for itself.\nBut no, Xinhua boasts of “exploding” trade between China and the Arab states—with China now being their second largest trade partner—and talks about all the “Arabian students” and visitors making some 340,000 temporary “trips” to China but says nothing about permanent resettlement.\nThat is especially unfortunate because citizens of the Western world are constantly told that migrant populations are a precious economic resource, and China’s economy is looking a bit ragged at the moment. How can the West, in good conscience, withhold the economic power of mass migration from China in its hour of need?","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/09/11/china-were-good-friends-with-arab-states-nope-still-not-taking-refugees/"}
