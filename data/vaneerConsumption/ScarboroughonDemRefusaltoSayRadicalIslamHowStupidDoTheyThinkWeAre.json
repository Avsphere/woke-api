Nobody’s calling all Muslims terrorists. Nobody’s suggesting the majority of Muslims are terrorists. But how stupid do they think we are? You have to recognize the threat, the threat is radical Islam.”\n(h/t Newsbusters)\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/16/scarborough-on-dem-refusal-to-say-radical-islam-how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are/"}
