The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nGWANGJU South Korea - Fifteen crew of a South Korean ferry that sank in April killing more than 300 people, mostly children, went on trial on Tuesday on charges ranging from negligence to homicide, with the shout going up of \"murderer\" as the captain entered the court.\nCaptain Lee Joon-seok, 68, and three senior crew were charged with homicide, facing a maximum sentence of death. Two were charged with fleeing and abandoning ship that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Nine were charged with negligence, which can also carry jail terms.\nBut family members appeared to have already convicted the crew who were caught on video abandoning ship, the captain in his underwear, while the children, obeying orders, waited in their cabins for further instructions.\nAs the defendants were led in, someone one shouted: \"That guy is the captain, isn't he? Murderer!\"\nOne relative held up a sign that read: \"You are not human. You are beneath animals.\" An altercation arose between the relatives and security guards who tried to take the sign away.\nThe Sewol, overloaded and travelling too fast on a turn, sank off the southwest coast on April 16 on a routine journey from Incheon on the mainland to the southern holiday island of Jeju.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/south-korea-ferry-disaster/crew-doomed-sewol-ferry-goes-trial-south-korea-n127061"}
