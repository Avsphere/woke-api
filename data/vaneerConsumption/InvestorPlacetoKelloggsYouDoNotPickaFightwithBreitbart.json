Specifically, “We regularly work with our media buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren’t aligned with our values as a company,” Kellogg spokesperson Kris Charles in a statement.\nOf course, no specific examples were given. The inference, however, is clear. Kellogg has bought into the media’s false narrative that conservatives and Breitbart’s website consist of deplorables, haters, racists, sexists, White Nationalists, who also kick puppies and club baby seals.\nWhatever your belief is doesn’t actually matter. Investing reality does. And the broader investing point is that Kellogg is being incredibly, mind-numbingly stupid.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2016/12/02/investorplace-kelloggs-not-pick-fight-breitbart/"}
