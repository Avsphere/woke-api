Inside the enormous building, one can view Deng Xiaoping’s cowboy hat, presented to him on a visit to the U.S., but learn nothing about one of the darkest periods of modern Chinese history, when the then paramount leader unleashed the army on his own people.\nThere is a photograph of a May 1989 Deng meeting with the then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev inside the Great Hall of the People, but nothing of the protests outside on the square while that meeting went on.\n“In China they try to eradicate the whole memory. They try to erase everything about June the 4th.”\nChina boasts that the museum is the largest anywhere under one roof. It was renovated over four years at a cost of $400 million, designed as a showcase of history and culture, and just re-opened to the public in 2011.\nModern history – “The Road to Rejuvenation,” as that section is called - is built around a series of major events, including the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and a fast train to Tibet.\nIt is about the Communist Party’s triumphs. There is no room here for an evaluation of what many regard as one of the Party’s greatest crimes.\n“In China they try to eradicate the whole memory. They try to erase everything about June the 4th,” said Lee at the museum in Hong Kong.\nThis year, as the 25th anniversary has approached, the clampdown in China has been severe, even by its own standards, with scholars and activists arrested, and efforts to block from the Internet even coded references to June 4.\nLee said that more than half the visitors to the June 4 Museum are mainlanders, visiting Hong Kong. He said they included recently a man whose job it was to censor June 4 references from the Internet, which is how he learned about the museum.\nThe 800 square foot exhibition – in words, old newspapers, photographs and video, some of it interactive – takes the form of a time-line, which winds maze-like around the room. There is a model of the goddess of democracy, the statue, inspired by the Statue of Liberty, which became a symbol of the democracy movement.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-trying-eradicate-1989-protests-history-n121376"}
