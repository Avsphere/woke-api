He also called on countries to downplay diplomatic efforts because “North Korea exploits its diplomatic privileges to fund its illicit nuclear and missile technology programs.”\nTillerson said imposing “financial isolation” on North Korea was his third request.\n“We must levy new sanctions on DPRK entities and individuals supporting its weapons and missile programs, and tighten those that are already in place,” Tillerson said, adding that, because China accounts for 90 percent of North Korea’s trade, it has the unique and important ability to influence North Korea on this front.\n“The U.S. and China have held very productive exchanges on this issue, and we look forward to further actions that build on what China has already done,” Tillerson said.\nTillerson’s final recommendation was to reiterate that all options are on the table for dealing with North Korea, including “military action.”\nTillerson also spoke in his remarks about a “moral” responsibility that the global community must consider.\n“Countries must know by now that helping the North Korean regime means enabling cruelty and suffering,” Tillerson said. “North Korea feeds billions of dollars into a nuclear program it does not need while its own people starve.”\n“The regime’s pursuit of nuclear weapons does not serve its own national security or the well-being of a people trapped in tyranny,” Tillerson said.\nJust this week, North Korea released a propaganda video simulating an attack on the United States that included images of the White House and the U.S. Capitol.\n“The enemy to be destroyed is in our sights. … We will show you what a strong country that leads the world in nuclear and missile technology is capable of,” the video caption declares.\nSince President Donald Trump took office, North Korea has launched six ballistic missiles, with the last attempt failing to launch.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/04/28/tillerson-u-n-united-states-cannot-idly-stand-by-north-korea-provocations/"}
