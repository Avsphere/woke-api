It’s hard, I’m feeling bad, but I hope. Still I hope,” he said.\n– Lacking job opportunities –\nFormer Ethiopian government regulator Melekot Woldemichael, who fled his country in 2009 after his anti-corruption work made him some powerful enemies at home, also laments the lacking opportunities to work in Switzerland.\nHe has not yet obtained a residence permit, meaning he not only must stay in Chiasso but is also barred from working in most fields while waiting for a decision on his asylum application.\n“I am a professional, but am only allowed to work as a cleaner, or something like that,” he told AFP.\nSVP is, meanwhile, calling for Switzerland’s already strict asylum rules to be tightened further, with the party’s most outspoken member and vice president Christoph Blocher insisting last week on the need to “eliminate the chaos”.\n“We have a lot of people coming to Switzerland who are not real refugees… We don’t have room for them,” Blocher said.\nAccording to a poll in August, half of the Swiss would favour closing the country’s borders, at least temporarily, to ward off the expected influx of migrants.\nNot everyone agrees though that the migrants pose a problem.\n“We have no migrant problem in Switzerland today,” said Fathi Derder, a parliamentarian for the Liberal Party, insisting instead that the country “is facing a dire lack of qualified labour”.\n“Instead of thinking about closing our borders, we should be rolling out the red carpet for the people that the Swiss economy so desperately needs,” he told AFP.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/10/14/europes-migrant-crisis-boosts-anti-mass-migration-party-swiss-election/"}
