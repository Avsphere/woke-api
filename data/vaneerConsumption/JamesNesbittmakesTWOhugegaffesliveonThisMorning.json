James Nesbitt, 52, was left red-faced when his phone rang live on air during This Morning interview on Thursday\nJames had been talking about his roles on both Cold Feet and Sky 1 series Lucky Man when he was interrupted by his own phone.\nPhillip Schofield had just asked him an in-depth question, but hesitating with his reply, the Northern Irish star confessed his mobile had been ringing in his pocket.\nLeft embarrassed, James remarked: 'Oh, that's terrible,' before admitting: 'My phone's ringing!'\nPhil and his co-host Holly Willoughby demanded to know who was trying to contact James, but he revealed he didn't know who the caller was when he attempted to switch his phone off.\n'[It's] someone from Leeds,' he said. 'It's probably one of those PPI calls.'\n'It's probably one of those PPI calls': The actor attempted to brush off the error by recalling a funny story of his daughter Peggy answering the phone to him\nThe Missing star then tried to save face by telling a story about his daughter Peggy and joked: 'I must tell you... recently I phoned their mum's house and my daughter Peggy answered it.\n'She said: \"Oh gosh, sometimes I wish it was PPI!\"'\nHis tale had Phil and Holly chuckling, but it wasn't enough to resolve his mishap as James had also made a huge error when addressing the work of Lucky Man creator Stan Lee.\nOn the series, he stars as a detective who is given supernatural luck from an ancient bracelet.\n'Stan Lee... he came up with Superman': The Missing star fell victim to yet another gaffe as he mistakenly suggested Marvel's Stan Lee had created DC comic Superman\nJames said: 'Stan Lee, who came up with this - he also came up with Superman and all those great Marvel heroes - the superpower he always wanted was the ability to control luck.'\nOutraged viewers were quick to point out that Superman was not a Marvel superhero and was part of DC Comics instead.\nOne Twitter user vented: 'Someone needs to inform James Nesbitt superman is dc not marvel.'\nA second said: 'I just died a little that on This Morning James Nesbitt said Stan Lee created Superman.'\n'Someone needs to inform him': Viewers hit out at the TV star and were quick to point out the error he had made\nA third commented: 'Apparently, according to James Nesbitt, Superman was created by Stan Lee and Marvel! #ThisMorning #ComicBookBlasphemy.'\nWhile a fourth viewer added: 'Correction James Nesbitt, Stan lee didn't create Superman, superman is part of DC not marvel! Do your research!'\nAnother questioned: 'Did James Nesbitt just say that Stan Lee created superman? Wrong company mate.'\nAnd one more tried to grab Phil's attention by tweeting him directly.\nThey said: '@schofe Play it back but James Nesbitt just said Stan Lee created Superman?'\nTell 'em Schofe! One viewer attempted to grab the attention of host Phillip Schofield and wanted the gaffe played back to highlight James' error","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4320474/James-Nesbitt-makes-TWO-huge-gaffes-live-air.html"}
