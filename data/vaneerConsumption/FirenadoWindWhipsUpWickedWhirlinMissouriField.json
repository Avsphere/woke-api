The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nA Missouri woman captured this incredible photo of a phenomenon that has been dubbed a \"firenado\" while she was driving down a country road near the town of Chillicothe last weekend.\n\"This had to be the coolest/scariest thing I've ever seen,\" Janae Copelin wrote on her Instagram page. \"A farmer burning off his field and as we stopped so I could take a picture the wind whipped up this fire twister.\"\nAccording to The Weather Channel, sights like this are more common than you might think:\nFirewhirls turn and burn. They are rapidly spinning vortices that form when air superheated by an intense wildfire rises rapidly, consolidating low-level spin from winds converging into the fire like a spinning ice skater, pulling its arms inward.The typical firewhirl can grow to about 100 feet tall, but is very narrow, on the order of a couple of feet wide.\nResearchers in Australia documented the process of \"pyro-tornadogenesis\" for the first time after analyzing evidence collected during a wildfire in Canberra in January, 2003.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/firenado-wind-whips-wicked-whirl-missouri-field-n100261"}
