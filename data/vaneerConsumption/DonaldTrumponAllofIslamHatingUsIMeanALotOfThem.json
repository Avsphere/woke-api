Last night you told CNN, quote, ‘Islam hates us.’ Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims?\nTRUMP: I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.\nTAPPER: Do you want to clarify the comment at all?\nTRUMP: I’ve been watching the debate today. They’re talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. I will tell you there’s something going on that maybe you don’t know about, maybe a lot of other people don’t know about, but there’s tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/10/donald-trump-on-islam/"}
