'There is one ... called Mendel's Dwarf. It is a scientific love story. That is the best way to put it. It is a really beautiful film.\n'Then the second one is called Hop Frog. It is based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It is a dark, dark atmospheric revenge tale. It is really, really great. It is kind of like a Grimm's' Fairytale. It is dark like that. But it isn't really fantastical. It is just more from that time period.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3422148/Peter-Dinklage-gets-little-height-prop-help-apple-box-set-Rememory.html"}
