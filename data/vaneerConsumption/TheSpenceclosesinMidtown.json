We weren't actively looking for buyers but when we were approached the deal made a lot of sense. We are not at liberty to discuss who the buyers are at this time as it's still confidential. However, we wish the new owners all the best as we look toward focusing on three new Atlanta concepts ( NEXTO and two hotel properties with details to be announced soon) as well as several concepts across the country opening in 2016-2018.\"\nFormer executive chef Richard Blais cooks at The Spence in 2013.

Concentrics owns several other restaurant in Atlanta, including One Midtown Kitchen, Parish and Two Urban Licks.\nBlais, who brought a high-profile reality television pedigree to the restaurant during his tenure due to his run on \"Top Chef,\" developed a menu that was \" all over the board --- punny and kind of silly, creative in ways that don't totally work, and then sophisticated and brilliant ,\" former AJC food critic John Kessler wrote in 2012.\nChef Wesley True took over the kitchen after Blais moved to San Diego in 2015 , but only stayed on a few months before going to work for The Optimist .\nReturn for updates.\nClick here to read the AJCâ€™s Ultimate Guide to Brunch in Atlanta\nClick here to read about dining in Atlanta around the clock\nRead more stories like this by liking Atlanta Restaurant Scene on Facebook, following @ATLDiningNews on Twitter.
