If you wanted that to change you would be crazy.\n\"That's part of what makes it so special.\"\nBezos, who created the online giant Amazon and later the space exploration firm Blue Origin, said the newspaper now has a vastly revamped technology team.\nUnder Bezos, the Post has ramped up its technology to allow its website to perform better, with improved analytics which gauge how readers are responding and deliver relevant advertising.\nIt has also made its articles more widely available through social network news services operated by Facebook and Google, and boosted its own social media efforts.\nPost publisher Frederick Ryan said the Post was now \"a media and technology company\" and that Bezos \"has given us runway to experiment with new ways to engage with readers and the resources to expand our newsroom and our engineering team.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3421676/Bezos-says-Washington-Post-lean-future.html"}
