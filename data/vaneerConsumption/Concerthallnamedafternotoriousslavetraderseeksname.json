toxic link it shares with the 17th century slave trade.\nColston Hall is named after the infamous businessman Edward Colston who made his money out of human misery and suffering.\nThe Bristol Music Trust, who runs the venue have been under pressure for the past several years.\nColston Hall, pictured, in Bristol is set to be renamed following an anti-slavery campaign\nArtists such as Bob Dylan have graced the stage of Colston aHall\nThin Lizzy played the iconic venue in 1976 before the controversy in the hall row developed\nThe Rollings Stones are among the world class bands to have played the iconic venue\nBristol's mayor Marvin Rees said he was fully supportive of the plans remove and replace the name of the hall by the end of the decade.\nThe name change, which will not come into effect until 2020, is part of a near Â£50 million refurbishment which bosses hope will make it a leading music venue.\nTrust chief executive Louise Mitchell said: 'The name Colston does not reflect the trust's values as a progressive, forward-thinking and open arts organisation.\n'We want to look to the future and ensure the whole city is proud of its transformed concert hall and so, when we reopen the new building in 2020, it will be with a new name.\n'This overall rebrand is part of transforming the Colston Hall we have today into the new National Centre for Music Entertainment, Education and Enterprise.'\nThe Trust has already raised two thirds of the money needed and the new name 'could include recognition of a commercial partner'.\nEdward Colston has several streets named after him around Bristol, although the decision to rename the venue, which has seen the likes of Nick Cave, has been condemned locally\nThey said they wanted Colston Hall to reflect 'the modern diversity and culture' of Bristol.\nLocal politicians condemned the controversial decision.\nCouncillor Richard Eddy slammed the decision to rename the venue.\nHe said: 'This disgraceful craven announcement by the Bristol Music Trust represents nothing less than an abject betrayal of the history and people of Bristol.\n''I is a complete surrender to the forces of historically-illiterate political correctness.\n''Instead of tackling the real victims of Modern Slavery in Bristol, critics of Edward Colston would much rather expend their energies on applying the mores, values and standards of today to the actions of a man who lived 400 years ago.\n'The latest clamour for change represents an attempt to selectively air-brush history away and betrays absolutely no awareness of the huge debt we still owe to this great Bristolian.\n'Even in the early twenty-first century, the inhabitants of our city still gain immeasurably from the housing, healthcare and schooling legacy of Colston.\n'I am utterly fed-up of pandering to the views of a tiny minority of non-Bristolians and outraged that the unelected directors of the Bristol Music Trust can make this controversial decision.\n'However, this pathetic capitulation will at least save me money.\nSome campaigners even want Edward Colston's statue to be removed because of his role in running the slave trade.\n'As a regular concert-goer to the Colston Hall, I do not intend to spend one penny on tickets there if it changes its name after 2020 and hope other true Bristolians will do likewise.'\nMarti Burgess, a trustee, said: 'We want to use this as an opportunity to open discussions with the Bristol public about how Colston Hall can reflect the diversity and inclusivity of our city.\n'The Hall's 150th anniversary this year is the perfect opportunity to begin these discussions.\n'We will be appointing an artist to help us talk to local groups about Colston Hall's role in the community and how we should recognise Colston's name in the new building.\n'We want to embrace our position at the centre of this naming discussion to work beyond the building and help lead conversations across Bristol about how we address and acknowledge the city's connections to the slave trade.'\nA Bristol City Council spokesman said: 'We welcome the progress Bristol Music Trust are making in their redevelopment plans and the clear vision they have set out for the future of Colston Hall.\n'Whilst the naming of the hall is not a matter for the council we respect the decision taken by the trust.'\nThe row over Bristol's Colston Hall follows calls for a similar form of ban in Oxford concerning Cecil Rhodes.\nThe Rhodes Must Fall campaigners wanted all references to the founder of Rhodesia - modern day Zimbabwe.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4448112/Concert-hall-named-notorious-slave-trader-seeks-name.html"}
