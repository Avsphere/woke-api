She joins the Audubon's current resident, Clara, an 8-year-old sea otter, in the aquarium's 25,000-gallon sea otter habitat.\nThe otter was found as an abandoned day-old pup in September 2015 by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Sea Otter Research and Conservation program. After several unsuccessful attempts of releasing her back into the ocean, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials determined she wouldn't survive on her own.\nThe aquarium is conducting an online poll to name the otter, which can be found on its website . The winning name will be announced March 16 on Audubon's Facebook page and website.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4301048/Audubon-Aquarium-welcomes-otterly-adorable-new-resident.html"}
