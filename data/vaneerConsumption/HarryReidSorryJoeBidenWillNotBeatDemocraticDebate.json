Organizers had reserved a podium for him in case he decided to make a dramatic entrance.\nFor now, Clinton holds a commanding lead over most of her rivals, though self-declared socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) leads her in New Hampshire and is mounting an aggressive challenge. Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee, and former Sen. James Webb of Virginia will be joining her onstage, hoping to make an impact that will allow them to make a polling breakthrough.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/13/harry-reid-sorry-joe-biden-will-not-be-at-democratic-debate/"}
