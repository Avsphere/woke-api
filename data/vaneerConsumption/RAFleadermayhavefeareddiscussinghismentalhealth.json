This would effectively end any chance he had of flying again.\n'This systemic issue of under-reported medical and particularly mental health issues for fear of negative career impact is something that is occasionally raised in military circles.\n'But I have not seen any effective attempts to address it in the pilot community. Even in retrospective I cannot pinpoint any clues that Nick was depressed. There was no change in his behaviour in the months leading up to his death.'\nThe inquest heard that the jet pilot had struggled to cope with the loss of his close friend, RAF test pilot Flight Lieutenant Alex Parr who was killed when the Yak-52 he was flying came down in 2016.\nSL De Candole was found dead six months later. His inquest heard he had discussed the loss of his friend, along with the suicide of another colleague, with his wing commander in the weeks leading up to his death.\nSL De Candole, 40, was a Typhoon jet pilot with an 'extraordinary' career spanning two decades\nMOD Abbey Wood commanding officer Captain Del Rowlands told an inquest in Bristol: 'His wing commander had known the SL for 13 years. He noticed nothing that indicated he was intending to take his own life.\n'There was, however, a bereavement of a very close friend in 2016 that had impacted on SL De Candole.\n'A test pilot colleague and a friend had died in an aircraft accident at MOD Boscombe Down in July 2016.\n'The death of his test pilot friend, along with the death of his immediate superior's father and the recent suicide of a wing commander acquaintance had been the subject of regular discussions between the SL and his immediate superior over the previous three months, and particularly over the week prior to his death.'\nSL De Candole, who lived in service housing in Bristol, enlisted in the RAF straight from university in 1996.\nHe had taken up a desk job and had declared his interest to retire in September 2017 after expressing concerns about his future career.\nThe inquest heard he complained of 'bureaucratic processes' when seeking promotion and was worried about his wife going back to work.\nBut he was persuaded to take up an 'improved posting' in a radio capability role at the MOD Abbey Wood in Filton, Bristol.\nAssistant coroner for Avon, Terence Moore recorded a narrative conclusion.\n'This is a man with an extraordinary career, he was a rare and valued commodity as far as the RAF were concerned,' he said.\n'He was clearly at a fork in his career, at a time of decision making but he had choices.\n'This was a man used to making decisions in the most stressful of situations.'\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447178/RAF-leader-feared-discussing-mental-health.html"}
