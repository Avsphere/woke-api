Most women who used withdrawal combined it with other methods, such as birth control pills or condoms, sometimes simultaneously and sometimes in rotation, the study found.\nAmong younger women in the survey aged 18 to 24, slightly more than 40 percent had used withdrawal to avoid pregnancy in the past month, but only 10 percent relied on it as the sole form of birth control, the researchers found.\n“Women in dating relationships and those strongly motivated to avoid pregnancy also had some of the highest levels of combining withdrawal use with condoms or highly effective methods,” Guttmacher officials said.\nThe new study counters previous national research that found that while nearly 60 percent of women had ever used withdrawal, only 3 percent were currently using it. That might be in part because many people previously surveyed didn’t regard withdrawal as a “real” or effective method of birth control, and so didn’t report it.\nJones and her colleagues constructed the survey differently, making sure to include withdrawal first in a list of birth control options and to allow reporting of mixed methods of pregnancy prevention.\nThe findings suggest that far more women rely on withdrawal as primary or back-up birth control, indicating that health care providers should discuss its use more thoroughly, Jones said.\nPulling out is about as effective as condoms for preventing pregnancy, with a failure rate of 4 percent compared to 3 percent for condoms, the study reported. Couples should understand that — and that withdrawal doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted infections.\n“Increased awareness of the pros and cons of withdrawal has the potential to result in lower contraceptive failure rates,” they wrote.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pulling-out-iffy-birth-control-plan-still-popular-n124966"}
