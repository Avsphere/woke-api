They expose the lungs to toxic chemicals, compromise the immune system and make it easier for bacteria to flourish in the airways, according to a new report in the Journal of Molecular Medicine.\n\"We want parents to know that nicotine is dangerous for kids at any age, whether it's an e-cigarette, hookah, cigarette or cigar,\" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden, said in a statement, \"Adolescence is a critical time for brain development. Nicotine exposure at a young age may cause lasting harm to brain development, promote addiction, and lead to sustained tobacco use.\" (snip)\nAs DiCaprio stated in his acceptance speech for the Clinton (yes, those Clintons) Global Citizens award last fall\nAfter explaining that \"less than three percent of all philanthropic giving goes toward protecting and preserving our environment,\" a statistic he called \"ridiculous,\" with even less going toward protecting the world's oceans, DiCaprio urged the audience of global leaders and philanthropists \"to put environmental issues at the forefront of the human agenda.\" (snip)\n\"Together we can find ways to scale up funding and create intelligent partnerships. By protecting our oceans and our wild lands we allow species to recover, local communities to thrive and ultimately maintain a stable climate for all life on Earth,\" he said.\n\"the world is now at a turning point, and climate change is the defining issue of our time.â€¦ The task before us to protect this planet will require the largest movement in human history. It will have to cross all cultural, religious and political boundaries. But the good news is the solutions are ready, and with leaders like the ones in this room who do not shrink in the face of crisis. They can rise, they can inspire and they can contribute. And that truly is the best hope of planet Earth.\"\nDiCaprio was presented his award by World Wildlife Fund CEO Carter Roberts, who said, \"Now more than ever nature needs a voice. Leonardo DiCaprio is that voice.\"\nRoberts praised the actor for using his platform and resources to make a difference and for working to understand the science and situation on the ground, calling the actor an eloquent, inspiring leader.","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/04/environmentalist_dicaprio_endangers_the_planets_citizens_one_ecigarette_puff_at_a_time.html"}
