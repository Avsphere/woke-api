Forty-five thousand concentration camps located throughout Europe speaks to the enthusiastic support the Germans received.\nIn the 21st century, the European Union is the Reich, and they mean for their power to be absolute. Juncker made it clear that the parties they call “far-right” will never have a voice in the EU no matter how big their vote totals get.\n“Far right” – what is that, anyway? Nazis? The Nazi Party was far-left: the National Socialist German Workers Party. What is far-right? Anti-Islamization? Anti-immigration? Pro-freedom?\nWhen you import an influx of Muslims, you get jihad. It’s hardly rocket science. The West faces jihad terror because a certain percentage of the Muslim population will kill in the cause of Islam. Yet Juncker and the other European Commission authorities are not moving to stop the migrant influx, but to crush dissent from parties that want to save Europe’s free and pluralistic societies.\nIt seems the Nazis are back, in a different uniform and with a cheekier narrative, but the objective is very much the same.\nLet’s be honest, they slaughtered six million Jews and imported 25 million Jew-haters. The problem for them is the fact that their new immigrants hate Europeans, too. But instead of facing that fact and doing something about it, the European Union is paving the way for the suicide of Europe and the West by guilt-tripping Europeans into thinking it’s morally wrong to oppose the migrant invasion.\nEight hundred thousand more Muslim migrants are lining up to invade Europe. Greece has its hands full. Muslim migrants are storming the border. They are violently rioting in refugee camps. Terror, terror, and more terror — and even aside from terror, there is the fact that Muslims are the only immigrant group that comes to Western countries with a ready-made model of society and government (sharia) which they believe to be superior to what we have here, and they work to institute it.\nAnd that is exactly what they are doing now in Europe — by force, or lawsuit, or intimidation. But as far as the European Union is concerned, “Islamophobia” is the real problem that they need to confront.\nThe Europeans learned all the wrong lessons from the horrors of World War II. The lesson that Europe had decided to avail itself of in the aftermath of Auschwitz was not that they were evil and behaved like monsters, but rather that everything was caused by nationalism and therefore what they really needed to do was create a European Union that would obviate their need for nationalism, so that they could become this transnational gobbledygook, and they’ll all get together and therefore they won’t have another Auschwitz.\nWrong.\nThe lesson they should have learned was that they were evil and they have to be good. That is the lesson they never learned. They have to be able and willing to make moral distinctions and stand up for the good and fight evil, and that is something the Europeans refuse to do.\nThey did not learn that lesson.\nThe UK could send a powerful message – a clear rebuke – to the EU’s authoritarian tendencies by voting for Brexit on June 23rd. Whether the British people can surmount the media’s propaganda campaign and all the political fear-mongering remains to be seen.\nPamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.
