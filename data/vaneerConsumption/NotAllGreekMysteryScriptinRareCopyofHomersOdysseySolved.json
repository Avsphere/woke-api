The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nAn Italian computer engineer with a keen interest in languages has solved the mystery of some perplexing scribblings found in the margins of a centuries-old copy of Homer’s “The Odyssey.”\nThe handwritten notations, a combination of French and a mystery script, appear on about 20 pages throughout Book 11 of a 1504 Venetian edition of “Odyssey” that was donated to the University of Chicago Library in 2007 by collector M.C. Lang. The script was thought to date back to the mid-19th century, but nothing else was known about it.\nDaniele Metilli, an engineer and software developer who is studying digital humanities at the University of Pisa, has identified the mystery script as a system of shorthand invented by Frenchman Jean Coulon de Thévénot in the late 18th century.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/not-all-greek-mystery-script-rare-copy-homers-odyssey-solved-n97516"}
