That is how it has been, and that is how it will remain.”\nNetanyahu added that no matter who wins the election, Israel’s ties with the U.S. would remain “solid.”\nDuring the last election in 2012, Netanyahu was slammed for supporting Mitt Romney and was even accused of attempting to aid in the Republican candidate’s campaign, including having his picture used in Romney TV ads.\nIn 2015, a State Department-financed nonprofit working in Israel led efforts to defeat Netanyahu during that year’s elections.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/11/07/netanyahu-warns-cabinet-to-keep-opinions-about-u-s-elections-to-themselves/"}
