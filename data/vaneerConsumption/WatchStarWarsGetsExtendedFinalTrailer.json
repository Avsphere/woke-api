The Dark Side… the Jedi… They’re real.”\nThe spot, which also features brief appearances by both Carrie Fisher and R2-D2, is careful not to give too much away but gives Star Wars fans just enough fodder to keep busy until the week before Christmas.\nNoticeably absent from both the trailer, and a new promotional poster for the film, is Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker).\nCheck out the new trailer above.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/10/21/watch-star-wars-gets-extended-final-trailer/"}
