Has he been in a VA facility?” he shot back at a reporter who questioned him about Trump’s proposals to fix the administration. “These are questions you might want to ask him.”\nFor the record Sam Clovis, one of Trump’s policy advisers on veteran’s issues, is a 25-year Air Force veteran.\nMcDonald made his comments during a Washington D.C. breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.\nWhen McDonald was asked by reporters if he knew the answers to his questions, he replied. “I do, of course, but you should look at the answers.”\nHe specified that he was not allowed to be involved in politics, citing the Hatch Act.\n“I’m not allowed to comment directly on candidates,” he said. “I better stay away from that.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/05/23/veterans-affairs-secretary-blasts-donald-trump-veterans-advisor/"}
