When you look at the old pictures, you do not see her.\n'She is rather small there. When we made high resolution scans and zoomed in, we saw her more closely, along with the details of her clothes and hairstyle.'\nHe added: 'She changes boots, stockings, and we can see some differences in her dress, but she is always in the same pose and with the same facial expression.\n'She never smiles. The fact that she changes her clothes makes me think that the pictures were taken not in a single day. It was over a period of some time. But what was the aim?'\nDespite good records and archives of local photographers at the time, the researchers cannot identify who took the pictures.\nResearch: At first researchers believed she was dressed in identical clothes in each of the 24 images so far unearthed, but closer inspection shows this is not the case\nDespite good records and archives of local photographers at the time, the researchers cannot identify who took the pictures\nSeveral have an imprint F.E.A. on them - which is perhaps a significant clue, but it does not relate to a known professional or amateur photographer at the time.\nSome but not all the images came to the museum from a collection of Nikolai Grigorovskiy, owner of a Krasnoyarsk bookshop before revolution.\nA glass negative featuring the girl was from the collection of well known photographer Ludwig Yulyevich Wonago: yet his name does not match the initials.\nMuseum experts believe the photographer was likely to have been an amateur at a time when photography was a pastime of the well-to-do.\n'We think that the girl could be the photographer's daughter, or his niece, but we do not know for sure, as we do not even know the photographer's name,' he said.\n'The set of pictures was named 'Phantom Girl'. I think we must try to solve this mystery, since the girl is almost a kind of brand for Krasnoyarsk.\n'It is quite strange that no one noticed her, though the pictures were widely used as illustrations - and they were even made into posters.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3420560/Who-phantom-girl-Siberia-Mystery-surrounds-identity-girl-appears-dozens-photographs-taken-Russian-city-100-years-ago.html"}
