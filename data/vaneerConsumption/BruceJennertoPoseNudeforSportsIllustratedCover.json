He also helped raise the four Kardashian children during his 24-year marriage to Kris Jenner.\nLast April, Jenner told ABC’s Diane Sawyer he has identified as female since childhood, and soon after, he began going by the name Caitlyn and wearing feminine clothing and makeup.\nAfter a rumored breast augmentation surgery last March, before Jenner’s public revelation, an associate of the former star athlete told RadarOnline that Jenner “went with a smaller [breast] implant because he didn’t want to look ridiculous.”\nAbout Jenner, who was once the epitome of American masculinity, the person said, “He’s not allowed to lift anything, and he has to wear a bra 24/7, but he’s expected to resume normal activities in the next six weeks.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2016/05/04/bruce-jenner-to-pose-nude-with-olympic-gold-medal-for-sports-illustrated-cover/"}
