Never forget that these attack began, sadly, with our very own president. In the wake of October’s mass-shooting in Oregon, during a news conference, it was President Obama who lashed out at the “thoughts and prayers” sentiment:\nA visibly frustrated President Obama offered condolences to the victims of the mass shooting at an Oregon college on Thursday, but he added that “our thoughts and prayers are not enough,” and voters should demand changes to the nation’s gun laws.\nAs they always do when The Master whistles, the elite media, led by NBC News and The New York Daily News, launched their hate-campaign against the Faithful.\nDo not let the bigots shame or fool you. Thoughts and prayers are not just a beautiful expression, they work.\nTwo highly-agitated men brandishing pistols and frustrated by the lack of cash in the office demanded my wife’s money. She didn’t have much. Nor did the other patients in the waiting room. Nor did the doctor or his staff. At this point there was nothing left to steal. But the armed robbers did not do what they were expected to do next: take the few hundred dollars and disappear into the night.\nInstead, right out of a horrific turning point in a Hollywood movie, things turned unpredictable, irrational, and of course terrifying. One of the gunmen suddenly demanded that everyone squeeze into a small room and lie down face first on the floor. This, though, was not a movie. No one asked why. No one said, “You have what you want, why don’t you just leave.” They did as they were told.\nBy this time, my wife and I had lived in Southern California for a number years in a little community called Monterey Park, just a few blocks from East Los Angeles. We never got used to the city, never got over our homesickness for North Carolina, but we loved the people and for the most part felt safe.\nThis was Los Angeles, though, so we had experienced two shootings: a murder practically on our front lawn and another that resulted in a Sunday afternoon shelter-in-place order. A couple of those police chases you watched on Fox News were close enough that we heard the sirens as they passed.\nMy wife’s doctor was located in a less desirable part of the city. But if you are going to live in the Big City, you have to live in the Big City. She’d been there many times before without incident. Besides, who robs a doctor’s office?\nThe two men were never caught, so we’ll never know the answer to that question. But as she lay on the floor listening to one of the armed robbers demand money from a doctor who didn’t have any more, my wife felt a gun barrel pressed to the back of her head. Knowing she was going to die, my wife began to pray out loud to the Holy Mother, “Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee…” She closed her eyes, continued to pray, and waited for it.\nThen, what to this day she still calls a miracle, happened: The man removed the gun barrel and said softly, “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you.”\nI’m sure anyone who is reading this from CNN or NBC News or any elite Manhattan/DC media salon is right now smugly chuckling at the Godtard who believes her life was saved by a bunch of superstitious words spoken to a woman who died 2,000 years ago.\nThe government didn’t save her. Climate Change summits didn’t save her. A James Taylor song didn’t save her.\nWhatever you might think of my wife’s faith, during the worst moment of her life, her personal expression of that faith gave her no small amount of comfort, changed the mood in that small room, and removed a gun barrel from her head.\nIf any of you media bigots got a better idea, I’d love to hear them.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2015/12/03/dear-elite-media-thoughts-and-prayers-saved-my-wife-from-a-gunman/"}
