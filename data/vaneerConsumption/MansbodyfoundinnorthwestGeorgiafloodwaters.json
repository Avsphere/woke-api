Divers searched the area Sunday and located the car with Treadaway still behind the wheel.\nMonday morning, the car was pulled from the water, and Treadaway was declared dead, the county’s deputy coroner said. Ralston said the man’s death was a tragic warning of what can happen following periods of heavy rain.\n“You don’t want to give up, and we didn’t,” Ralston said. “But there’s a lot of people who risk their lives trying to recover a body, and we know there’s more rain coming.”\nIn a separate drowning incident, a Calhoun man died when the boat he was in flipped on a private lake, Bo Nicholson, the deputy coroner, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Divers located the body of Robert John Murray, 38, shortly before noon Monday, Nicholson said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/man-body-found-northwest-georgia-flood-waters/xKRBKdBlGunKJ2gMDiizOL/"}
