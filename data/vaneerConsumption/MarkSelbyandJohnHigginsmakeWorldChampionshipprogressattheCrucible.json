I got to about 80 and thought it was the end of the break, and I potted a black into the middle, potted a red down the rail, but when I got down to the black I was more nervous than in any part of the match.\n“I was really, really happy to knock that final black in as well. It was a freaky break.”\nIt followed runs of 132 and 139, as Selby demonstrated why he has been world number one for the last two years.\nLatest World Championship odds I've had from the sponsors - though I hear Mark Selby's just been trimmed to 11/8. pic.twitter.com/aR6yuskJM9 — John Skilbeck (@JohnESkilbeck) April 26, 2017\nFu was full of admiration for the 33-year-old, who is chasing the £375,000 top prize and plays Ding next, starting on Thursday afternoon.\n“He’s unplayable at times. You’ve got to make him the favourite now after that performance,” Fu said.\nFour-time former champion Higgins comes into the picture too, from the opposite side of the draw.\nJohn Higgins is through to the semi-finals.
