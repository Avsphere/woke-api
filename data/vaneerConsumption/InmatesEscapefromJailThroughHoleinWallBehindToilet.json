One of them was involved in a foot chase with police, and another was found in a home near the jail, Fox News reported.\nOne inmate, David Wayne Frazier, 54, is still on the loose and is considered dangerous, WATE reported.\nFrazier is awaiting trial for aggravated robbery and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/12/28/inmates-escape-jail-hole-wall-behind-toilet/"}
