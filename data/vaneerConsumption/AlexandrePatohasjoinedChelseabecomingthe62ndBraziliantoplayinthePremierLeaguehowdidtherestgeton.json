While a few have lit up the English game, most notably Juninho at Middlesbrough, too many have sunk without a trace.\nWith Pato becoming the 62nd player from Brazil to play in the Premier League, Sportsmail looks back at all the others, and rates their time in England....\nAlexandre Pato has joined Chelsea on loan, becoming the 62nd Brazilian to grace the Premier League\nAlex – Chelsea – 2007–12\nDogged defender who partnered John Terry to win the Premier League and two FA Cups while at Stamford Bridge. 7/10\nDefender Alex (left) won the Premier League and two FA Cups with Chelsea, and was famed for his free kicks\nAfonso Alves – Middlesbrough – 2007–09\nScored just four goals in his first full season as Boro were relegated, failing to justify a hefty price-tag. 2/10\nAfonso Alves (right) arrived at Middlesbrough with a stunning scoring record, but failed to have much impact\nAnderson – Manchester United – 2007–15\nArrived as a star of the future, and though he never justified his huge price tag, four Premier League titles and a Champions League is not a bad return. 5/10\nAnderson arrived at Old Trafford as a 'star of the future', but never hit the heights in an injury-hit spell\nAnderson Silva – Everton – 2006–07\nPlayed just one league game before moving to Barnsley, first on loan, then permanently. 1/10\nAnderson Silva managed just one game for Everton, before moving to Barnsley\nFabio Aurelio – Liverpool – 2006–11\nA wand of a left foot but injuries hampered the full-back's time at Anfield, with just 87 league games over six years. 6/10\nFabio Aurelio was excellent for Liverpool when he played, but was hampered by a succession of injuries\nJulio Baptista – Arsenal – 2006–07\nPopular if inconsistent during his season-long loan. Best remembered for four goals against Liverpool in the League Cup. 6/10\nJulio Baptista was hit and miss at Arsenal, but is best remembered for his League Cup scoring exploits\nJuliano Belletti – Chelsea – 2007–10\nNot always a regular starter in his three-year spell, the attacking full-back nonetheless became a fan favourite, won a Premier League title and two FA Cups. 6/10\nDespite never really making the right back spot his own, Juliano Belletti was a popular player at Chelsea\nBranco – Middlesbrough – 1996\nA World Cup winning defender with 72 Brazil caps, he could hardly get a game and left after making just nine appearances. Perhaps the Premier League's most disappointing Brazilian. 1/10\nAfter arriving at Boro amid plenty of excitement, Branco was a huge disappointment in his time on Teesside\nCacapa – Newcastle United – 2007–09\nA central defender who never looked up to Premier League standard, left after the club were relegated. 2/10\nCacapa (right) never impressed at Newcastle, and his two years at the club ended in relegation\nPhilippe Coutinho – Liverpool – 2012–\nCapable of brilliance, but not yet consistent enough, the attacking midfielder still looks a player Liverpool must build their squad around. 8/10\nCapable of scoring brilliant goals, Coutinho is already a Premier League star, but needs to find consistency\nDavid Luiz – Chelsea – 2011–14\nDescribed by Gary Neville as like a player 'being controlled by a 10-year-old on a PlayStation', Luiz's defending was haphazard but he won the league and the Champions League in his time at the club, while turning a tidy profit. 7/10\nOften derided for his defensive lapses, David Luiz was nonetheless a success in his time at Chelsea\nDenilson – Arsenal – 2006–11\nHeld up by some fans as a symptom of the club's lack of investment, Denilson's Arsenal career ended badly, but before that he had several seasons as a tidy midfielder. 5/10\nAlthough he tailed off towards the end of his time at the club, for a time Denilson was a key player for Arsenal\nGuly do Prado – Southampton – 2012–14\nSomething of a cult hero on the south coast, where he was instrumental in helping Saints back into the top flight, but couldn't hit the heights once they reached the Premier League. 6/10\nGuly do Prado was a star for Southampton in their double promotion, but was less impressive in the top flight\nDoni – Liverpool – 2011–12\nSigned for free as a back-up for Pepe Reina, Doni played just four Premier League games, one of which saw him sent off, before a heart-attack ended his career prematurely. 2/10\nLiverpool's back-up goalkeeper Doni played just four league games, and was sent off in one of them\nDoriva – Middlesbrough – 2002–06\nMade 79 appearances in the league, without ever seeming to have a huge impact. Part of the team that won Boro's first major trophy in 2004. 4/10\nDoriva (left), seen battling compatriot Gilberto Silva, helped Middlesbrough to their first ever major trophy\nEdu – Arsenal – 2000–05\nNever a regular starter, but a useful midfielder who consistently made those around him look good. Two Premier League titles, three FA Cups, and an Invincible. Not bad. 7/10\nEdu may never have been a regular first-team player, but played a big part in two title wins\nElano – Manchester City – 2007–09\nNot a typical Brazilian playmaker, but provided goals and assists under Sven Goran Erikkson, before fading under Mark Hughes. 6/10\nElano contributed 10 goals and the same number of assists in his first season, before fading away\nEmerson – Middlesbrough – 1996–97\nRemembered fondly alongside compatriot Juninho, the dogged midfielder never really hit the same heights as his team-mate on Teeside. 4/10\nEmerson (left) arrived with Juninho, but although he worked hard he never had the same talent as the No 10\nFabio – Manchester United, Queens Park Rangers, Cardiff City – 2009–14\nHe and his brother were meant to be United's full-back pairing of the future, but with more relegations than titles, it is safe to say Fabio never hit the anticipated heights. 3/10\nOnce heralded as a future Manchester United star, Fabio has since suffered relegation with two different clubs\nFernando – Manchester City – 2014–\nAn accurate passer, and City's most defensive-minded midfielder, Fernando is often criticised, but improving. 5/10\nFernando struggled when he first arrived at Manchester City, but is beginning to show his worth in midfield\nFernandinho – Manchester City – 2013–\nLike Fernando, it took him a while to hit his stride in a City shirt, but is now a regular starter and a key player at the base of midfield. 6/10\nRarely out of the first team, Fernandinho is a key player for a City team which are fighting for the title\nFilipe Luís – Chelsea – 2014–15\nBrilliant at Atletico Madrid, the move to Chelsea ought to have seen him hit new heights, but he was a peripheral figure in Jose Mourinho's title-winning team, and left after one season. 3/10\nDespite his obvious talent and title-winning experience, Filipe Luis struggled to get into the Chelsea team\nRoberto Firmino – Liverpool – 2015–\nArrived with a big price-tag and great expectations, but, so far, has shown only glimpses. Jury is still out. 6/10 (so far)\nRoberto Firmino has had an indifferent start to his time at Liverpool, but has shown flashes of brilliance\nFumaca – Newcastle United – 1999–2000\nTrials at Grimsby, Birmingham, Watford, Derby, Colchester, Barnsley and Crystal Palace, with varying levels of success, eventually led Fumaca to Newcastle. His performance on debut was so bad it was compared to Ali Dia, and he played five games in total. 1/10\nFumaca (right, on the floor) managed five games for Newcastle - but failed to impress in any of them\nGabriel Paulista – Arsenal – 2014–\nImpressed Arsenal's new stats-based scouting system, and has looked good when called upon, despite moments of rashness. Could well be a long-term star a centre back. 6/10\nWhile he is yet to make a starting spot his own, Gabriel is already beginning to look comfortable in England\nGeovanni – Manchester City, Hull City – 2007–10\nScored against United in one of only two Premier League starts for City, while at Hull the flamboyant midfielder was a star, even if he faded during a second season that ended in relegation. 6/10\nA fringe player at Manchester City, before emerging as a star at Hull, Geovanni was a scorer of great goals\nGilberto – Tottenham Hotspur – 2007–09\nA left back best remembered for being subbed at half time on his debut. Spurs' first Brazilian, his performances - there were 10 in all - raised the question of how he had ever won international caps. 2/10\nGilberto, a Brazilian international, was one of the worst players to play for Spurs in the Premier League era\nGilberto Silva – Arsenal – 2002–08\nUnderstated brilliance at the base of midfield, he was vital in the Invincible season. The fact that many Arsenal fans still believe he has still not been replaced says it all. 10/10\nSuch was Gilberto Silva's influence at Arsenal that the club are still yet to satisfactorily replace him\nGlauber – Manchester City – 2008–09\nA cult hero without ever starting, Glauber got a standing ovation for his only appearance, coming on for 10 minutes on the final day of the season, after being named as an unused substitute 20 times. He left the club straight after. 1/10\nAfter 20 games as an unused substitute, Glauber finally played 10 minutes on the final day of his only season\nHeurelho Gomes – Tottenham Hotspur, Watford – 2008–11, 2015–\nBrilliant on his day, but with horrible errors thrown in, the goalkeeper eventually deemed not up to standard at Spurs is re-asserting himself as a Premier League player with Watford. 7/10\nAlways eccentric, but an excellent shot-stopper, Heurelho Gomes is rebuilding his reputation in the top flight\nIlan – West Ham United – 2009–10\nA striker who scored four times in his 11 games for the club, helping keep them in the Premier League before being released after just six months. 4/10\nDespite a reasonable goalscoring record that helped keep West Ham up, Ilan only lasted six months at the club\nIsaias – Coventry City – 1995–97\nThe Premier League's first Brazilian, and it rather set the tone. He brought midfield flair in his dozen appearances, before injuries, and the arrival of Gordon Strachan, ended his first-team chances. 3/10\nIsaias arrived at Coventry as the first Brazilian in the Premier League, but injuries hampered his spell there\nMario Jardel – Bolton Wanderers – 2003–04\nA once-prolific striker, and Europe's leading marksman just two years previously at Sporting, Jardel's time at Bolton was a disappointing one, as he looked overweight and never managed a league goal. 2/10\nHaving scored bags of goals around Europe, Mario Jardel never hit the heights in the Premier League\nJo – Manchester City, Everton – 2008–11\nCity splashed £19m on the striker who was supposed to be Brazil's next great. After just one league goal, and a loan spell at Everton, he left England. An expensive flop. 2/10\nJo celebrates a rare goal for Manchester City, where he failed to justify his hefty price-tag\nJulio Cesar – Bolton Wanderers – 2004–05\nThe defender had been around the first team at Real Madrid, but injuries, and other options, meant he hardly got a game at Bolton. 2/10\nJulio Cesar arrived at Bolton having played for Real Madrid, but couldn't hold down a first-team spot\nJulio Cesar – Queens Park Rangers – 2012–13\nAn excellent shot-stopper but unable to keep QPR in the top flight after joining from Inter Milan. Stuck around in the Championship despite being out of the team. 5/10\nHaving signed from Inter Milan, Julio Cesar was unable to keep QPR in the Premier League\nJuninho – Middlesbrough – 1995–97, 1999–2000, 2002–04\nThe original cult hero, the diminutive midfielder starred for Boro across three spells, and was voted their greatest ever player in 2007. 10/10\nThe most highly celebrated Brazilian import to the Premier League, Juninho was a star across three spells\nKenedy – Chelsea – 2015–\nYoung, and has shown great potential in his limited opportunities this season. A rating at this point is fairly arbitrary, but the possibility for greatness is there. 6/10 (so far)\nStill only a young player, Kenedy has been given some game time and looks a star in the making for Chelsea\nKleberson – Manchester United – 2003–05\nA vital part of the 2002 World Cup winning side, and still good enough to make the Brazil squad in 2010, Kleberson was a huge disappointment in Manchester, as injuries and poor performances hampered him. 3/10\nHaving recently won the World Cup when he arrived, Kleberson failed to live up to expectations at United\nLucas Leiva – Liverpool – 2007–\nPerhaps the least 'Brazilian' of the lot, in terms of footballing style, but a gutsy, hard-working defensive midfielder, who has gone from something of a joke in his first season to a popular first-team player. 8/10\nAfter a slow start, Lucas Leiva's hard work and no-nonsense attitude have made him a star for Liverpool\nMaicon – Manchester City – 2012–13\nHad been a star at Inter and for Brazil, but by the time he arrived at City age had caught up with the full back. The odd bit of attacking brilliance not enough to merit his huge wages. 3/10\nAlthough he still looked ok going forward, Maicon was well past his best during his season at Manchester City\nMineiro – Chelsea – 2008–09\nSigned by Phil Scolari as cover for Michael Essien and John Obi Mikel, he played just 15 minutes of Premier League football in his season at the club, coming off the bench with his side already 5-0 up against Sunderland. 2/10\nMineiro played just 15 minutes of Premier League football after coming in as cover in midfield\nNene – West Ham United – 2014–15\nOnce the top scorer for PSG, Nene arrive at West Ham last January on a free transfer. Eight games, no goals, and despite never looking terrible, he also never merited a contract extension. 3/10\nNene calls for the ball during his time at West Ham, but the striker never managed to score in his eight games\nOscar – Chelsea – 2012–\nA gifted creative midfielder, somewhat stifled by Jose Mourinho at times, Oscar remains, on his day, one of the best players in the league. 8/10\nOscar has proved himself a phenomenal talent, despite struggling at times under Jose Mourinho\nPaulinho – Tottenham Hotspur – 2013–15\nAfter he starred for Brazil at the Confederations Cup, much was expected of the box-to-box midfielder on his arrival at Tottenham. But Paulinho's form for both club and country hit a downturn, and he was deemed a failure by the time he left to move to China. 4/10\nMuch was expected of Paulinho when he arrived at Tottenham, but his form dipped alarmingly after signing\nAndreas Pereira – Manchester United – 2014–\nOne of the most talented youngsters in the current crop of United's academy graduates, Pereira is tipped for big things, but has not yet really broken into the first team. 6/10 (so far)\nAndreas Pereira is one of a number of Manchester United youngsters to get their chance under Louis van Gaal\nBruno Perone – Queens Park Rangers – 2011–12\nSigned on a budget before the arrival of Tony Fernandes' millions, which rendered him surplus to requirements. The defender played just one Premier League game, in which Franco di Santo scored twice - not a ringing endorsement. 2/10\nBruno Perone was surplus to requirements at QPR before he'd even made his debut, and played just once\nLucas Piazon – Chelsea – 2012–13\nPart of Chelsea's loan brigade, the attacking midfielder has impressed in Holland and is currently at Reading. Only 22, and talented, but probably too inconsistent to ever add to his 16 minutes of Premier League football at Chelsea, though he may be back with another club. 3/10\nLucas Piazon has played for Chelsea in the Premier League, but has since become one of their many loanees\nRafael – Manchester United – 2008–15\nLike his brother, so much was expected of the young full back, but although he - unlike Fabio - did become an established first-team player, he didn't kick on as hoped. Finally left the club last summer after falling down the pecking order under Louis van Gaal, but played his part in three Premier League titles. 6/10\nRafael managed to become United's first-choice right back for a while, but lost that spot and was moved on\nRamires – Chelsea – 2010–16\nDespite his undoubted talent, will always be remembered as a functional player with 'a big engine'. A crucial, and delicious, goal in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona will be the abiding memory of the energetic midfielder. 7/10\nRamires, who has just left Chelsea to move to China, was an energetic midfielder often underappreciated\nDouglas Rinaldi – Watford – 2006–07\nSigned in January 2007 to try and keep Watford in the top flight, the technically gifted midfielder scored once in just six starts. He didn't play a single league game in his second season, after which he was released. 3/10\nDouglas Rinaldi played six games in his first six months at Watford, and not at all in his second season\nRobinho – Manchester City – 2008–10\nA huge coup when City poached him from Chelsea on the final day of the transfer window in 2008, the supremely talented Brazilian was good in flashes, without ever being the great player he might have been. 6/10\nRobinho arrived in dramatic circumstances, but failed to live up to his reputation or price-tag\nFabio Rochemback – Middlesbrough – 2005–08\nA midfielder who had played at Barcelona, Rochemback was more functional football than samba flair, but nonetheless played a big role in the run to the UEFA Cup final. 5/10\nFabio Rochemback was a key man in Middlesbrough's run to the UEFA Cup final\nRodrigo – Everton – 2002–03\nFour appearances - all off the bench - into a loan spell, the defender suffered a serious knee injury in training. He never played for the club again. 1/10\nRodrigo played just four times for Everton before a serious injury ruled him out for the rest of his loan spell\nRoque Junior – Leeds United – 2003–04\nA World Cup and Champions League winner, Roque Junior arrived at Leeds with real optimism. His five Premier League games included one red card and 20 goals conceded - he did not play a minute after November, and the year-long loan deal was cut short in January. 1/10\nThe hapless Roque Junior played five Premier League games for Leeds, during which their defence crumbled\nSandro – Tottenham Hotspur, Queens Park Rangers – 2010–15\nRemarkably still only 26 years old, he faded away after an impressive start at Spurs, in part due to injuries. Now back in the Premier League with West Brom. 6/10\nHaving had spells at Spurs and QPR, midfielder Sandro is thought to be close to joining West Brom\nAndre Santos – Arsenal – 2011–12\nOne of four deadline-day signings, that followed the 8-2 defeat at Old Trafford, the attacking left back ought to have been an upgrade on Armaund Traore, who played in that embarrassing defeat. The fact that he was not says it all. One of Arsene Wenger's worst ever signings, who left as little more than a running joke, even to Arsenal fans. 1/10\nAndre Santos arrived at Arsenal at a time when anything would do - and still wasn't good enough\nRafael Schmitz – Birmingham City – 2007–08\nA central defender who was at St Andrews for a season on loan from Lille, and made little impact as the club were relegated. 3/10\nBirmingham defender Rafael Schmitz spent a season at the club on loan, but could not prevent relegation\nSylvinho – Arsenal, Manchester City – 1999–2001, 2009–10\nA talented left back who will be remembered for a very good goal against Chelsea before leaving to join Barcelona having already been replaced in the first team by Ashley Cole. A year at Manchester City in his final season did little to alter his reputation. 6/10\nSylvinho was a star for Arsenal after his arrival, but soon found his place taken by a young Ashley Cole\nEmerson Thome – Sheffield Wednesday, Chelsea, Sunderland, Bolton Wanderers – 1997–2004\nExcellent at Wednesday in a doomed team, he struggled for games at Chelsea, where he was replaced by Winston Bogarde. Left Sunderland because they would have had to pay Chelsea if he made it to 50 games, signing for Bolton and then dropping down the leagues to Wigan and Derby. 6/10.\nEmerson Thome played for four Premier League clubs, but was more 'get it out' than samba football\nWillian – Chelsea – 2013–\nChelsea's stand-out performer this season, a hard-working and talented midfielder who is also proving himself as a dead-ball specialist. Already excellent, and always improving. 8/10","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3422493/Alexandre-Pato-set-join-Chelsea-62nd-Brazilian-play-Premier-League-did-rest-on.html"}
