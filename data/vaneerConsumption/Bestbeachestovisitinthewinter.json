One of our highest regarded is the fine, white and pink-sand Horseshoe Bay. The Atlantic shoreline, rimmed with limestone rocks and dotted with intimate coves, is named for its curved shape.

If you're down for some time in the water, don't miss out on killer snorkeling; parrot fish, angel fish and snappers are just some of the colorful aquatic species you may encounter.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-beaches-to-visit-in-the-winter-2016-12"}
