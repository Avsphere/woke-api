The opera, which has drawn an outpouring of massive protests, is based on an all-too-real episode -- the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by terrorists of the Palestine Liberation Front. The terrorists shot and killed Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound passenger, and threw him into the sea. John Adamsâ€™s opera, however, turns the story upside down so that it becomes a vehicle for humanizing terrorist killers and vilifying Jews and Israelis. For example, an Arab chorus blames the 1948 founding of modern Israel as the source of all regional mishaps. Israeli soldiers are portrayed as brutally driving Arabs from their homes, chanting â€œIsrael laid all to wasteâ€ -- a gross slander that ignores repeated Israeli appeals to Arabs to remain in their homes with guarantees of...

€œWhen poor men are gathered they can find Jews getting fat, cheating exploiters, defilers of virgins.â€ In sharp contrast, Palestinian terrorists are depicted as â€œmen of ideals.â€ Additionally, critics of the opera object to its misleading title -- The â€œdeathâ€ of Klinghoffer. A way of disguising a horrific murder that also becomes a way of cleansing terrorists. Notwithstanding the operaâ€™s rancid anti-Semitism, the Times has become its No. 1 defender. On Sept. 19, it published an editorial calling on the Metropolitan Operaâ€™s board of directors to stand firm against rising protests. The editorial omitted all anti-Semitic passages of the libretto, instead asking readers to trust the Times that the opera is â€œnuancedâ€ and â€œgives voice to all sides.â€ The Times also cited artistic freedom as a rationale to keep the opera on the Metâ€™s performance roster. The Times followed with an Oct. 15 â€œnewsâ€ article that described the opera as â€œcritically acclaimed.â€ Acclaimed by whom? By the Times, of course. And again, the Times shied from publishing anti-Semitic excerpts of the libretto, trying to keep its readers in the dark about the real content of the opera. The Metâ€™s only concession has been a note by Klinghofferâ€™s daughters, Lisa and Ilsa,that takes strong issue with staging the opera -- â€œIt rationalizes, romanticizes, and legitimizes the terrorist murder of our father.â€ Their note will be included in the program of â€œThe Death of Klinghoffer.â€ Small consolation for Klinghofferâ€™s kin. As for the late Leon Klinghoffer, he has been murdered twice -- once aboard the Achille Lauro and now by the New York Metropolitan Opera.
