The Department for Education (DfE) and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will join the Cabinet Office in displaying the LGBT flag on Saturday.\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government has also tweeted its support for “all our LGBT staff and those at Pride in London this weekend”, although it did not confirm whether it will display the flag.\nOn the other hand, the Treasury confirmed they will not be flying the rainbow flag, with a spokeswoman saying: “We only have one flagpole and will continue to fly the union flag”, while a spokeswoman at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was unlikely they will fly the flag as they “don’t have a flagpole”.\nAll other government departments have so far declined to comment on their plans.\nLast week, the Foreign Office caused a stir by announcing it will not fly the rainbow flag this year despite the fact it flew it for last year’s gay pride. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond also reportedly informed British embassies around the world not to display the flag.\nThe Cabinet Office appeared to hit back, however, with Matthew Hancock tweeting a picture of the rainbow flag and saying it will be flying over his department.\nProud to be flying the rainbow flag for Pride over the Cabinet Office today pic.twitter.com/Hno8UMjE4M — Matt Hancock (@MattHancockMP) June 22, 2015\nA Foreign Office spokesman said that the decision not to fly the flag was part of long-standing policy: “The Union flag always takes priority\n“It is flown from the FCO’s main flagpole at all times. It is never substituted for another flag. It is the FCO’s long-standing policy to fly the Union flag, national flags and the flags of Overseas Territories.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/06/24/two-more-government-departments-confirm-plans-to-fly-rainbow-flag/"}
