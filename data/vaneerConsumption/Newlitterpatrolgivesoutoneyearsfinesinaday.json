By contrast, the council handed out only 277 fines over the whole of 2016.\nThe number of litter wardens, who are dressed in official looking uniform and wear body cameras, has more than quadrupled – from just four to 17 – in Liverpool since Kingdom took over.\nAlthough the firm denies that wardens receive commission for handing out penalties, the firm is paid half - £40 – of every ticket issued.\nThat means that, in the first nine days of the pilot in Liverpool, the firm could potentially pocket more than £50,000 if all the fines are paid.\nYesterday it emerged that Kingdom staff have already been accused of using ‘under-hand’ tactics to catch offenders, after they were caught issuing penalties to customers at a Tesco supermarket without permission.\nThe firm is paid half of every £40 ticket issued - meaning that Kingdom could have already potentially pocketed more than £50,0000\nManagers of the store eventually called police, who asked the wardens to leave the supermarket, which is technically private property, following several complaints.\nIt is not the first time the practices of Kingdom, which has contracts with at least 32 councils and makes more than £2million profit a year, have been questioned.\nPreviously, one man was fined for dropping a bookmark, another woman was issued with a ticket for feeding bread to ducks, while a couple were fined for dropping cherry stones underneath a tree.\nOne customer, who was accused of dropping a cigarette butt at the Tesco supermarket, in Old Swan, Liverpool, last week, accused the enforcement officers of being ‘intimidating’ and ‘threatening’.\nThe 30-year-old engineer, who did not want to be named, took photographs of the wardens, who refused to give him their names, after they threatened to track him down via his workplace or call police when he refused to hand over his name and address.\nThe customer said one of the men stood with his fists clenched, while the other was ‘getting in his face and shouting’ after he refused to co-operate.\nKingdom have previously given tickets to a woman for feeding ducks, and a couple were fined for dropping cherry stones under a tree\nHe said: ‘They told me I had dropped a cigarette and I asked them to show me where. One of them pointed at where there were about 30 cigarette butts and claimed one was mine.\n‘There was no way they could prove it, so I refused to give them my details. They threatened to tell my bosses and called the police, but they had no authority to detain me so I left.’\nThe man added that when he returned to the shop the following day, two wardens targeted him again.\n‘I knew they recognised me so I decided to test what they were doing and put my cigarette butt on the floor, before quickly picking it up and putting it in a bag in my van,’ he added.\n‘The wardens jumped out of their car and one of them dived in front of my van and made me stop, it was crazy.\n‘They looked just like bailiffs and were quite intimidating and aggressive, one of them was stood with his fists clenched and the other was getting in my face and shouting.\n‘I agree people shouldn’t drop litter, but these wardens should be out on the streets in the city, not targeting people going into Tesco. It’s a money-making scam, they are trying to catch people out, it’s wrong.’\nPolice had to be called to a Liverpool Tesco where litter wardens were caught handing out fines on private property without permission\nMerseyside Police confirmed they were called to the supermarket last Thursday lunchtime.\nA spokesman said: ‘Officers attended and established they were genuine enforcement officers, who were subsequently given advice that this was private land and any enforcement of this kind has to be approved by management.’\nA spokesman for Liverpool City Council said two fines for litter dropping handed out on the Tesco site had been paid, but confirmed that the team would be avoiding the supermarket car park in the future.\n‘The legislation regarding fixed penalty notices for litter applies to any open land, regardless of ownership,’ he said.\n‘Following a request from store management, we will not be patrolling their car park in future.’\nTesco said it would talk to the council about its litter schemes, but councillor Steve Munby, cabinet member for neighbourhoods at Liverpool City Council, said the supermarket chain ought to be ‘ashamed of themselves’.\nHe added: ‘I am surprised and disappointed with the response from Tesco. Have they never heard of corporate responsibility? The litter may have been on their land but it can blow onto other areas.\n‘What sort of message are they sending out? They should be ashamed of themselves.’\nLiverpool City Council has employed Kingdom to run the new litter operation as part of a 12-month blitz.\nIt comes on the back of a proposal by Mayor Joe Anderson to waive council tax for individuals who are able to provide information leading to the conviction of a pet owner for dog fouling.\nLast night Kingdom failed to return calls or emails to the Daily Mail requesting comment.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4299528/New-litter-patrol-gives-one-year-s-fines-day.html"}
