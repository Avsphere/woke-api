They do big, bold things. They have sexy signings, that’s what they have built themselves as, that’s what they sell themselves as, and this type of signing would fall right into play with that.”\n“The pitch to Zlatan Ibrahimovic is not just that you get to come to Major League Soccer and they will pay you a lot of money,” added Lalas.\n“It is also that you get to expand that brand in a market that continues to get bigger and bigger. I think they do have a chance (of signing Ibrahimovic). Whether it’s this summer or maybe a year from now I still think there is going to be an interest.”\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho, meanwhile, is pleased to have arrived home with an away goal and a fully-fit squad having secured a hard-fought Europa League draw on Rostov’s dreadful pitch.\nUnited made the 1,875-mile journey back from southern Russia immediately after the last-16 first leg at the Olimp-2 stadium, where the sandy, rock-solid playing surface infuriated the Portuguese.\nFive major talking points from tonight's Round of 16 first leg against FC Rostov: https://t.co/4yxxpmSNDq #MUFC pic.twitter.com/Vx6XLfFhOx — Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 9, 2017\nMourinho’s request to have the match called off unsurprisingly fell on deaf ears, but UEFA officials will have been relieved to see tournament favourites United come through unscathed.\nThey would have also gone back with a first-leg win was it not for Aleksandr Bukharov making it 1-1, although Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s away goal could prove crucial in next week’s return leg at Old Trafford.\n“We go home with a positive result,” Mourinho said. We know that it will be a difficult match, we know that we need to win or to have a goalless draw, so the game is open.\nMore from Jose: \"An away goal is positive; 1-1 is better than 0-0. Old Trafford will push us & hopefully we'll get to the quarter-finals.\" pic.twitter.com/OM1UOQbz7t — Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 9, 2017\n“The tie is open, but in these circumstances I think it was a positive result.\n“An away goal is always positive. It is better to be 1-1 than 0-0, obviously. But the game is open, the result is open and this Rostov team have experience of playing big matches, big opponents, big stadiums.\n“I don’t think it is a problem for them to go to Old Trafford and to compete against us.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4300568/Lalas-LA-Galaxy-held-talks-Manchester-United-striker-Ibrahimovic.html"}
