Students quickly proceeded to wipe out the “Stop” and leave the word “Islam.”\nRick Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the University of Michigan, said in a statement on Wednesday: “We do not typically remove chalk on sidewalks or walkways. It is a regular occurrence across campus and on the Diag.”\nHe said that the university’s policy on chalking reads: “Chalking with water soluble chalk is allowed on University sidewalks and plazas. Chalking is prohibited on other University property including, but not limited to, buildings, columns, seating walls, steps, and other surfaces, structures and fixtures. The University has no responsibility for maintaining or removing chalk placed on sidewalks or plazas.”\nHowever he added that “attacks directed toward any member or group within the University of Michigan community, based on a belief or characteristic, are inconsistent with our values of respect, civility and equality.”\nThe phrases “Build the Wall,” “Stop the Rape of Europe,” and “Trump 2016” were also reportedly written on other parts of the campus.\nYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew or email at ben@yiannopoulos.net","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/04/01/stop-islam-pro-trump-messages-chalked-onto-university-of-michigan-campus/"}
