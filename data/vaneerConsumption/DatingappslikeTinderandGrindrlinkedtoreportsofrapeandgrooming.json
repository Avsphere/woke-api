Ministers claim it is ‘too costly’ to administer and have ordered a review.\nSome 30 police forces responded to the request, which showed that two years ago there were just 21 crime reports involving the dating app Tinder, compared with 277 in 2015. Meanwhile Grindr saw numbers rise from 34 in 2013 to 135 last year.\nTinder is hugely popular among heterosexual daters with around 50million users worldwide, while Grindr is a gay dating app.\nReports of aggression and sexual crimes were the most common, with 253 allegations of violence and 152 of offences such as rape, grooming and sexual exploitation of children.\nThe figures come from police reports where the apps are mentioned and does not automatically mean they were used directly by the alleged criminal.\nHowever there have been documented cases in which they were used.\nDeputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke, head of public protection for the National Police Chiefs’ Council, blamed the rise in crime reports on the apps’ growing popularity.\nHe also warned users to be careful about who they contact. ‘I would urge those who use online dating apps to be as security conscious as possible,’ he said. ‘[They should] not share personal data until they are sure about who they are communicating with.’\nStranger danger: Deputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke warned users not to share personal data until they are sure about who they are communicating with\nHuman rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘The steep rise in sexual and violent offences is a worrying trend that seems likely to continue. I suspect these figures are just the tip of the iceberg.’\nMeanwhile the NSPCC warned that children are in danger if they use the apps.\nA spokesman said: ‘Dating apps are not safe for children. It’s easy for children to say they are older, or for adults to pretend to be younger.’\nIn September, former teacher Gary Pearce from Sidcup, Kent, was given a five-year jail sentence for grooming a 14-year-old boy he met on Grindr.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393116/Dating-apps-fuel-rise-sex-attacks-Sites-linked-reports-rape-grooming.html"}
