She keeps her gun of choice–a Ruger LCR .22 Magnum revolver–close at hand as she operates the shop and says the world would be a better place with more love and less hate.\nHowever, one thing she is sure the world doesn’t need is more gun control. When she was asked whether the government should pass more gun laws following an attack like the one at UCC, Kellim said, “I think that’s the worst thing in the world they could do. They’ve got so many laws now that they are not even looking at, and more constraints on guns is not the answer.”\nKellim refers to Obama as “executive anus” and says she doubts whether “he’s ever carried a gun.” She added, “I’m not sure he’s ever shot one … but he seems to think that they’re bad all the way through. They’re not.”\nAsked why she gives her profits away, Kellim stressed that showing kindness is “so important in today’s world. We have to take care of people that have had a bad luck stroke.”\nKellim said:\nThe thing that we need to do … we need to love people a heck of a lot more and make sure that all of our people in this community are accepted and that they have friends and that they have somebody maybe to just sit down and talk to.\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
