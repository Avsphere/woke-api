Mike Huckabee blasted the priorities of Washington politicians as “pathetic and absolutely absurd” when asked about his reaction to the Planned Parenthood hearing on Tuesday.\n“Washington’s priorities are pathetic and absolutely absurd,” Huckabee exclusively told Breitbart News when asked what he thought about Planned Parenthood’s Cecile Richards testimony Tuesday. Huckabee explained, “More than 300,000 of our veterans have died waiting for healthcare, while Washington prioritizes pumping $500 million into Planned Parenthood each year.”\nSince undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials allegedly attempting to sell aborted baby body parts went viral on the internet, the conservative base has pushed Congress to defund Planned Parenthood.\nHowever, the Senate passed a spending resolution to fund the government through December on Wednesday, and within that resolution, they ignored the conservative base and funded Planned Parenthood. The bill now moves to the House.\nHuckabee’s argument is that Planned Parenthood isn’t a government agency. “The taxpayers have no responsibility to fund it. Veterans ARE our responsibility and as President, it would be my top priority,” Huckabee vowed.\n“Our country is $19 trillion in the hole and Planned Parenthood had a surplus of $127 million last year. Clearly this private entity does NOT need public taxpayer funding to function,” he explained.\n“Planned Parenthood isn’t purely a ‘healthcare provider’ any more than a heroin dealer is a community pharmacist. Butchering babies and harvesting their organs to be swapped and sold is evil. I join with millions of fed-up and frustrated Americans who are disgusted that Washington uses our tax dollars to fund this despicable organization.”\nHuckabee blasted the infighting in Congress as “ineffective” and said it “misses the real issue, “our Constitution guarantees every American rights and due process under the law.”\nHuckabee said it’s time to end abortion in America.\n“It’s time for leadership on this issue – one who can lead, fight, and actually win.” Huckabee declared, “America needs a leader, not a loser.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/09/30/exclusive-mike-huckabee-washingtons-priorities-pathetic-funding-planned-parenthood-veterans-die-waiting-healthcare/"}
