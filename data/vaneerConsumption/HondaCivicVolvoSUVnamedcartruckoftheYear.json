Volvo is owned by the Chinese Geely group.\nKerrsemakers said the vehicle combines Volvo's reputation for superior safety with better fuel-economy, owing in part to its use of a four-cylinder engine.\n\"This shows we obviously are on the right trail,\" he said.\nKerrsemakers said Volvo's Chinese owners grant the company operational independence.\n\"I don't have any particular opinion about Chinese cars in the US,\" he said.\n\"We are Volvo.
