They also found a shared goal, such as aiming for a 5K together, helped invigorate relationships.\nAnd a highly-influential, often-cited 1974 study by Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron (of New York Stony Brook University) revealed the increase in heart rate, sweatiness and breathlessness makes you more attracted to the other person.\nSo where's a good place to start?\nHere, Jonathan Rentas, a personal trainer at New York Health & Racquet Club 50th Street, shares his ultimate guide for couples hitting the gym, covering upper body, lower body and core...\nUPPER BODY WORKOUTS:\n1.
