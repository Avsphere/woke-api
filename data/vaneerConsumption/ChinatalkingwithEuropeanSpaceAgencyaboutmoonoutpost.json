They were confirmed Wednesday by Pal Hvistendahl, a spokesman for the European Space Agency, or ESA.\n\"The Chinese have a very ambitious moon program already in place,\" Hvistendahl said. \"Space has changed since the space race of the '60s. We recognize that to explore space for peaceful purposes, we do international cooperation.\"\nFILE - in This Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016, file photo, the moon rises over a logo for AVIC or Aviation Industry Corp in Beijing, China.

It plans to launch a mission to collect samples from the moon by the end of this year and next year conduct the first mission to the moon's far side and bring back mineral samples.\nThe ESA hopes to conduct a mission analysis on samples brought back by this year's Chinese mission, known as Chang'e 5, and also have a European flying on the Chinese space station at some future date, Hvistendahl said. Neither prospect has been finalized.\nChina was excluded from the International Space Station mainly due to U.S. legislation barring such cooperation and concerns over the Chinese space program's strong military connections.\n___\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/matthewbrownap","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4447122/China-talking-European-Space-Agency-moon-outpost.html"}
