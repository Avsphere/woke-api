The pair also enjoy wearing similar loungewear, wearing long tracksuits with rips in social media snaps\nDrama central: The former bar worker has seen her tumultuous year-long relationship with co-star Pete Wicks (pictured December 2016) play out on the ITVBe show\nMegan, formerly known for appearing on Ex On The Beach, made an explosive entrance on the show as Pete's girlfriend in March 2016.\nThe pair seemed to go from strength to strength, until it was discovered in October that Pete was secretly sending sexually explicit text messages to his ex girlfriend, Jacqui Ryland, 30, behind Megan's back.\nThe discovery spelled the beginning of the end for the couple.\nThey tried to reconcile their relationship, but Megan, finding herself unable to let go of the betrayal, eventually finished their relationship shortly after their one year anniversary in March this year.\nTOWIE viewers have seen a bitter feud erupt between Chloe and Megan, who accused the former of getting close to Pete behind her back - a claim that Chloe vehemently denies.\nWith Amber being the best friend of Georgia Kousoulou, 25, who has pledged allegiance to Chloe in the face of the row and vowed to not speak to Megan, the pair may find it awkward to remain friends amid the divide of the friendship groups.\nThe EX factor: Amber is undoubtedly focusing on the rekindled romance between her and ex-boyfriend Chris Clark, 22 (pictured together last summer)\nFormer flames: Chris only split from Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson earlier this month\nAmber is undoubtedly focusing on the rekindled romance between her and Chris Clark, 22.\nChris briefly dated Little Mix bandmate Jesy Nelson for a couple of months earlier this year, and even attended the BRIT Awards to support her back in February.\nHowever, it recently emerged that he had liked smouldering photos of Amber whilst he was in a relationship with the singer, causing fans to accuse him of using the singer to boost his own career.\nIt was also claimed Chris had dumped Jesy via a phone call.\nA representative for the reality star declined to comment as a source revealed to The Sun: 'Chris is a normal Essex lad, he's very private and low key. He likes spending time with his mum and mates and not being in the spotlight.\n'Jesy's life is a world away from his. She's a superstar, travelling the world and living in the spotlight.'\nChris had previously dated Amber for a few months last year, which was widely televised on the hit ITV Be show.\nThe former lovers' reunion first date will be aired on Wednesday night on TOWIE, and they will be seen to enjoy a romantic evening dining at a restaurant.\nThe Only Way Is Essex airs on Wednesday 26th April at 10pm on ITVBe","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4447774/Megan-McKenna-Amber-Dowding-slip-skimpy-swimsuits.html"}
