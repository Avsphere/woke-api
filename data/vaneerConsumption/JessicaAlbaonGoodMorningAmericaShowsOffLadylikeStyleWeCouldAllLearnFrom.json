The days when ladies, well, dressed like a lady instead of heading out of the door in pajamas, slouchy tees, and outfits that leave little to the imagination. Yes, I know what you’re thinking right now: “Wow, this girl sounds like my 80-year-old grandmother, but a lot less cool.” And it’s true; I do have a classic-leaning (some may call it \"old school\") style and very traditional tastes — at least when it comes to fashion.\nBut as great as Rihanna looks in her slinky nightgown outfits, as awesome as Cara Delevingne is in her rocker-chic T-shirts, and as sexy as Kendall Jenner appears in her hip-bone bearing gowns, I think there’s a lot to be said about stars who like to dress in ensembles that veer toward the conservative, elegant, and sophisticated end of the spectrum.\nJust take Jessica Alba, for example. This superhot actress/model/businesswoman can turn up the sex appeal in a snap with a simple curve-hugging dress (like the corseted David Koma number she wore to the 2014 Guys Choice Awards). But the gorgeous star can just as easily nail a ladylike style without effort, which she did on Tuesday for her appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America.\nSporting a printed, fit-and-flare Antonio Berardi dress — complete with a feminine pink hue, a voluminous midi skirt, and a tasteful (but still sexy) plunging neckline — with her open-toed metallic pumps, a patterned pouch, and a sleek high ponytail, the actress gave us a short-and-sweet lesson on what it really means to dress like a lady in the modern world.\nThe big takeaway: Classic silhouettes in a bright hue or fun pattern can take any traditional ensemble from stuffy to chic in about two seconds flat.
