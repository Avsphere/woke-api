I give you the most classy display of visible bra in an outfit ever. Look closely enough, and you'll notice that the top of Lawley's top is actually her bra. It's like magic. When I first saw these shots of Lawley, I immediately had the urge to reimagine every single bra in my wardrobe and wear them as my everyday clothing. In retrospect, that probably wouldn't be the best idea, given that I am neither Robyn Lawley nor Rihanna.\nHowever, I do think that some bras are worthy of being displayed because they're just that pretty. Whether they're peeking out under the top of a dress, being layered under a sheer top, or being paired with some high-waisted shorts while you hope no one notices that you're wearing a bra, and not a shirt, pretty bras are probably a little more versatile than you think.\nAnd in a world where I find myself wearing the same, comfortable top three to five days out of the week (oops), I'm always grateful for a way to re-imagine my wardrobe. So thank you, Robyn Lawley.\nBrad Barket/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nWant to channel this brunette bombshell? Here are a few more bras that deserve some time in the spotlight.\n1.
