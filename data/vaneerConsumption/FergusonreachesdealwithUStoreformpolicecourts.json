Thomas (AFP/File)\nPolice officers in the town of 21,000 regularly pulled over motorists without reasonable suspicion, carried out arrests without probable cause and used excessive force.\nWhile African Americans make up two-thirds of Ferguson's overall population, they accounted for 93 percent of arrests in 2012 through 2014.\nAfrican Americans also accounted for 85 percent of people stopped by Ferguson police, 90 percent of citations issued and 88 percent of instances in which force was used.\nFerguson's local judicial system also came under a harsh light, with the report finding that African Americans were 68 percent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge.\nAnd the town itself was accused by Attorney General Eric Holder of using law enforcement as a means to boost revenues, rather than ensure public order.\nThe city \"has made some positive changes to its law enforcement practices,\" since the scathing report was released in March, the Justice Department said in a letter to Ferguson's city council.\nThe reforms laid out in a 131-page consent decree will \"ensure that the City's stated commitment to refocusing police and municipal court practices on public safety, rather than revenue generation, takes root and will not be undone,\" it added.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420181/Ferguson-reaches-deal-US-reform-police-courts.html"}
