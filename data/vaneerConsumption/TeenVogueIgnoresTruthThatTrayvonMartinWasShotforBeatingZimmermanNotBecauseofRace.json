Zimmerman, a member of the neighborhood watch, was suspicious of the 17-year-old African-American boy and began following him while talking to police on the phone.\nAt some point, Martin turned and confronted Zimmerman and began physically assaulting the Hispanic man. Zimmerman drew his firearm and shot his attacker, killing him. Upon arriving at the scene, police found that Zimmerman had received multiple injuries from the attack.\nBut here is how Teen Vogue described the incident in its February 5 piece:\nAlmost five years ago, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by a “neighborhood watch” member as he walked home from a convenience store where he had purchased a juice drink and a package of Skittles. George Zimmerman, the man who shot Trayvon, believed him to be “possibly dangerous” because of his race and the fact that he was wearing a hoodie.\nThe magazine, aimed at teenagers, omitted the fact that Zimmerman was being beaten up by the younger, larger, and stronger attacker.\nIn addition, there is no evidence that Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon Martin or believed he was “possibly dangerous” based only on his race.\nUltimately, Zimmerman was acquitted of murder based on his claims of acting in self-defense and in accordance with Florida’s “stand your ground” laws.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2017/02/06/teen-vogue-ignores-truth-trayvon-martin-shot-beating-zimmerman-not-race/"}
