Rick Ross, the MC known for a thick shining beard as well as his affinity for tattoos and his occasional aversion to shirts, told them all what he did, all the time.\n“Everyday I'm hustlin',” he said, his low voice aided by a drudging beat, his spirit made buoyant by the primal act of repetition.\n“Everyday I'm hustlin'... Everyday I'm hustlin' ... Everyday I'm hustlin'.”\nEvery. Day.\nThe song spoke of illicit hustles.\nThese days, Ross, who lives south of Atlanta, has a different kind: franchising.\nIn the coming weeks, he’s opening a new restaurant outside Decatur, called Wingstop, located at 4920 Flat Shoals Parkway, Suite 102. He owns a number of other Wingstops.\nThe opening date isn’t yet clear. The company intends to announce it next week.\nOne thing is clear: when the doors swing open, Ross will be there.\nThat day will be, after all, a day like any other, a day like everyday.\nRoss knows what he must do.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/still-hustlin-rick-ross-opening-wings-joint-dekalb/Xarf0d9hVbrWrIyw9YF1jJ/"}
