E! reports that hotel heiress slash fashion personality Nicky Hilton is now engaged to James Rothschild. Like his fiancée, Rothschild is similarly an heir, except instead of being linked to a famous hotel chain, he's an heir to a banking family. So at least they have that in common, right? Well, that, and their unyielding love for one another.\nThe two have been dating since 2011 when they met at Petra Ecclestone and James Stunt's wedding in Italy, which is apparently where their romance was born.\nSo how did Rothschild pop the question to Hilton? Us Weekly has a source that says this is what happened:\nThey went on a romantic anniversary trip over the weekend [...] He took her out on a boat into the middle of Lake Como and he proposed, got down on one knee and everything. It was incredibly romantic and beautiful.\nLet's just hope that onlooker wasn't, like, a leering creep trying to be a part of this otherwise really romantic sounding moment.\nBut who cares! They're engaged! Time to start planning a really expensive wedding! What will her dress look like? Will Kimye be there? What about Nicole Richie? So many questions.\nAnd, oh yeah, sister DJ Paris Hilton commented. She posted the following on Instagram:\nCongratulations to the happy couple! Your wedding pics will definitely be stunning.\nImage: parishilton/Instagram","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35645-nicky-hilton-engaged-to-james-rothschild-paris-hiltons-comment-is-really-cute"}
