I’ve talked enough about that.”\nEarlier in the week it was reported that Wenger’s right-hand man Primorac was set to leave and take up a managerial post in Turkey – but the Frenchman once again channelled his inner Donald Trump to play down the rumours.\n“That’s a complete invention,” he said. “It’s good today. You say anything and everybody takes it without checking any information. Everybody just takes and takes it and makes a subject. It’s not serious. Fake news.”\nMeanwhile, right-back Bellerin has again been linked with a move to Barcelona having enjoyed a good season in north London.\nHector Bellerin\nBut, like with his assistant, Wenger said there was no foundation to suggestions the 21-year-old was set for an exit.\nAsked about whether he was aware of interest in Bellerin from the Catalan giants, Wenger replied: “No.\n“He just extended his contract. It’s an unbelievable amount of years to go. I believe again it’s very difficult to take these things seriously.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4320202/Wenger-rubbishes-reports-claiming-Primorac-Bellerin-set-leave-Arsenal.html"}
