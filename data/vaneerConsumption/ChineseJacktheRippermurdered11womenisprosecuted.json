The DNA was incredibly close to that of the serial killer.\nThey tested those family members of the relative and Gao was confirmed to be the 'Chinese Jack the Ripper'.\nIt was then that police found his DNA matched that of the killer they had been looking for.\nGao later confessed his actions to police, saying that he committed the first murder by accident in 1988.\nHe tried to steal a radio from a 23-year-old woman while she was sleeping and killed her after she woke up.\nThe man said he gained a sense of satisfaction from killing and carried out further murders - 10 over 14 years.\nOne victim was just 8-years-old.\nThe killings all took place in Baiyin, China's Gansu province between 1988 and 2002\nHe said that if he found the victim attractive then he would rape them otherwise he would just cut their throat.\nFor those that tried to resist him, Gao would disfigure them.\nSome victims also had their reproductive organs removed.\nA local police officer told CGTN that Gao could remember all of the details of the killings: 'He was way too calm, showing no regrets or guilt.'\nGao is married with children making his actions even more bizarre. The family have since cut ties with the man and have refused to meet his lawyer.\nThe man has been dubbed the Chinese 'Jack the Ripper'.\nThe original Jack the Ripper was a serial killer active in east London in the late Victorian era.\nHe is widely believed to have murdered five women, mutilating several of them. Those killings have never been solved.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4448306/Chinese-Jack-Ripper-murdered-11-women-prosecuted.html"}
