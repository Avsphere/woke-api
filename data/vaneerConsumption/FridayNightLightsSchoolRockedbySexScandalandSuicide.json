Several weeks later, a trainer at the school, April Collins, resigned amid similar allegations.\nAn indictment accuses Collins of sending explicit pictures of herself and steamy text messages to a student. She allegedly offered to rent a room where they could have sex.\nMaples is also accused of sending a student lewd photos and a text that described her desire to have sex with him, court papers say.\nMaples' lawyer did not return calls. Collins' lawyer, John Green, said charges should never have been brought.\n\"She was an athletic trainer and a basketball player started making passes at her,\" Green said. \"He was 19 years old. He's an adult.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/friday-night-lights-school-rocked-sex-scandal-suicide-n100421"}
