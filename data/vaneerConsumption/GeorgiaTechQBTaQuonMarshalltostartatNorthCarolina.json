He said Tuesday he won't take the starting job from Marshall, a senior captain , just because Oliver ran for three touchdowns in his first start last week.\nOliver, a freshman, was dominant in the 49-28 win over Virginia Tech . His 40 carries for 215 yards were the second-highest totals for a quarterback in school history.\nJohnson says Marshall is healthy after missing practice last week. Georgia Tech says Marshall had an upper body injury and provided no further details.\n___\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional/georgia-tech-taquon-marshall-start-north-carolina/4Ms20T7sJ4aV6cgAOWOjOJ/"}
