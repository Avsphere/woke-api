An Australian Federal Police spokeswoman would not comment on the incidents.\nAssistant principal Rod McKenzie of Cowes Primary School, on an island off Victoria, told Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper a receptionist received a \"computerised\" message through a phone call which said there was a \"bomb in a backpack but no more specifics\".\nThe threats to the French and British schools on Tuesday were claimed by a Twitter account calling itself the Evacuation Squad, with a profile picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBut the Sydney Morning Herald said an email it purportedly received from the group denied they were behind the Australian hoaxes.\n\"We have only targeted schools in Europe, Canada, The United States, South Africa, and Japan,\" Fairfax reported the email as saying, citing the user name Viktor Olyavich.\n\"We are unsure of who it is (behind the Australian attacks). It is most likely a 'copycat' incident.\"\nAustralia raised its terror alert level to high in 2014, introduced new national security laws and conducted several counter-terrorism raids across the country amid growing fears of home-grown extremism.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3422437/Australian-schools-evacuated-lockdown-threats.html"}
