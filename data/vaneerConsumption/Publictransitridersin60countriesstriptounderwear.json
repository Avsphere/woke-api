It was the Mexican-born restaurant worker's first foray into the \"international celebration of silliness,\" as organizers billed it.\nThe laughter-filled ritual started in the largest U.S. city in 2002 and has expanded nationwide and overseas, from Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas to London, Berlin, Prague and Vienna.\nA woman walks past several men clad in their underwear at the 59th Street station in Manhattan during the 15th annual No Pants Subway Ride Sunday, Jan. 10, 2016, in New York. The group event, a prank meant to amuse unsuspecting subway riders, has been going on since 2002. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens)\nIt's coordinated by Improv Everywhere, a global flash mob.\nNew York participants were assigned personal numbers for central gathering spots in each city borough. \"And then at, say, the third stop in Brooklyn, you take off your pants in the train,\" explained Latesha Mack, who made it to Manhattan's Union Square station in fishnet stockings below her panties. \"So it's not like, a bunch of people on one train with no pants.\"\nWhile most clothed straphangers weaved their way through bare flesh, some were left shocked.\nA tall, elegant man — totally clothed — stopped in his tracks as he entered the station.\n\"I asked the police, 'What's going on?' and he said, 'It's no pants day,'\" said Manhattan entrepreneur Mark Francis. \"And I said, 'what?'\"\nThe cop told him it was a \"tradition.\" More than 4,000 New Yorkers participated.\nIn Phoenix, Arizona, the city's light rail system party included a pants-less outing to a pub.\nNicole Black brought her Superman underwear from 40 miles (64 kilometers) away for \"a day off to have fun and enjoy and see what Phoenix has to offer\" — including temperatures in the 50s Fahrenheit making the attire reasonably comfortable.\nBoston also enjoyed spring-like weather, with rain causing some riders to wipe the drops off their legs as they boarded trains.\nEven families took part everywhere, carrying babies bared to their diapers.\nAnd a Berlin woman had a cat's face splashed across her — well, cheeks.\nAt a London station, coats and scarves warded off the chill — at least from the waist up.\nThen there were the once shy types.\nBill Murphy, a New York translator, said he didn't realize he had certain talents until Sunday — wearing only a red bikini as he burst out gyrating amid the Union Square station crowd.\n\"I'm 56 and I'm kind of proud of myself. At a senior age, it's supposed to be not acceptable, but I want to change the perception of that: I've become an exhibitionist today,\" he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Terry Tang in Phoenix and Amy Anthony in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.\nA man in boxer shorts and a woman wearing hosiery with a garter belt wait for a train at a Manhattan train station during the 15th annual No Pants Subway Ride Sunday, Jan. 10, 2016, in New York.
