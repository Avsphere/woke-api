You expect him to be safe because it is a school. You don’t expect nothing like that to happen in the school. Where was security?” the boy’s father said.\nA tribunal hearing has been recommended for the student accused of the attack, who will not return to BEST Academy after spring break, Atlanta Public Schools spokeswoman Alicia Lurry said. There have been no other sexual assaults reported at the school this year, she said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/student-accused-sexual-assault-all-boys-school-suspended/x2EgcRgk5NrOtSsqwlu2bK/new.html"}
