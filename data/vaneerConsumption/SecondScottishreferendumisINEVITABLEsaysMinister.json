The PM's spokesman refused to state categorically that Mrs May would block a vote.\nBut he said: 'The question is should there be a second referendum, and we don't believe there should.\n'The referendum was only held in 2014, it was a fair and legal vote, and both sides said they would abide by the result.'\nMrs Sturgeon was also quizzed by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg on whether or not she was bluffing about holding another referendum. She said: 'I'm not and I never have been.'\nScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: 'People in Scotland don't want a second referendum, and the SNP doesn't have a mandate for one.\n'Nicola Sturgeon needs to provide some certainty for Scotland, and rule it out.'\nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said: 'This is another attempt by Nicola Sturgeon to sow division, at a time when the country needs to pull together more than ever.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4299720/Second-Scottish-referendum-INEVITABLE-says-Minister.html"}
