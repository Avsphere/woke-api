They must clean and maintain the property in the meantime and send bi-monthly reports to DeKalb County inspectors.\nVincent Lu and Habib Osta, who have been feuding for years over the tower, couldn’t come to an agreement last month with DeKalb officials on the violations. They faced as much as $34,000 in fines before Tuesday's court hearing.\nThe building was most recently a condo complex and has been vacant several years.\nSome, including Commissioner Nancy Jester, see it as emblematic of the problems of blight troubling the county.\n»RELATED: What's with the rundown tower at Spaghetti Junction?\n»RELATED: South DeKalb apartment saga continues — with fugitive landlord\n---\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter and Instagram","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/spaghetti-junction-tower-owners-agree-fines-ordered-clean/RpBpGRA2nhpKVDaBFjVfVO/"}
