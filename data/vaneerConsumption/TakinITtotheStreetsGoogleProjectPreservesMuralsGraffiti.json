The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nGoogle's Cultural Institute collects all manner of art and architecture for online viewing â€” and its most recent project is getting street art off the street and into your browser.\nBetween murals, graffiti and random \"guerrilla art,\" the walls and abandoned buildings of the world are a rich canvas for artists who can't (or don't want to) put their work in a gallery.\nBut such installations and spontaneous compositions are often prey to weather, removal if illegal, or (ironically) vandalism. And, of course, while a painting or even a large sculpture may be moved to a nearby museum, it's rather hard to pick up a whole parking garage or retaining wall and store it for convenient viewing.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/takin-it-streets-google-project-preserves-murals-graffiti-n127701"}
