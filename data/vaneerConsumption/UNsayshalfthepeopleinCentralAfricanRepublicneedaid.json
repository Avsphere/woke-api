Some people are now receiving half-rations of food.\n\"Let us not leave Central African Republic to become a forgotten or neglected crisis by the international community,\" said the country's humanitarian minister, Virginie Baikoua.\nThe deficit funding means humanitarian agencies, which manage 56 percent of health infrastructure in the country, are reviewing their presence, the U.N. said.\nViolence continues in parts of Central African Republic, which descended into sectarian conflict in 2013. The country held successful democratic elections last year, though many remote areas remain outside the government's control.\nThe call for aid comes as President Faustin Archange Touadera has reassured the public that the government is doing its best to take control. Touadera has called for an extension of World Bank support to help with disarming ex-combatants. The program has lagged because of a lack of funding.\nWorld Bank Vice President for Africa Makhtar Diop visited the country in the past week after the institution last year promised $500 million to help Central African Republic rebuild over the next three years.\n___\nThis version corrects to say the 400,000 displaced is total, not just since September.\n___\nPetesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4320224/UN-says-half-people-Central-African-Republic-need-aid.html"}
