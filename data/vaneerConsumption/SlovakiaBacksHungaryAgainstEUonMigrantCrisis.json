Lessons for President Trump…? https://t.co/6OFbNVpbuv — Jack Montgomery ن (@JackBMontgomery) September 16, 2017\nPellegrini confirmed the Slovak government was sympathetic to Hungary’s new laws increasing the financial transparency of foreign-funded NGOs and penalising NGOs which aid and abet illegal migration, many of which are backed by billionaire open borders activist George Soros.\n“Naturally, I don’t want to interfere in the affairs of Slovakia, and indeed I cannot, but I advise you to exercise caution,” Orbán warned.\n“George Soros is not only active in Hungary, but also in your country. We’re talking about a very dangerous financial speculator, who has made an enormous amount of money from ruining millions of people. He has attacked the currencies of entire countries, and made a great deal of money; money is his God,” he said.\n“And George Soros has a very large number of people – hundreds and thousands – on his payroll, whom he pays in one way or another… a great many people are working to guide and influence events… in the direction that he is committed to. This is the reality.”\nPellegrini agreed that NGO transparency in his own country is “inadequate” at present, and warned that if they do not take steps to increase it voluntarily, “Slovakia will also have to initiate changes to force them to reveal the sources of their funding.”\nHungarian Govt Outlines ‘Stop Soros’ Legislation Criminalising NGOs Which Aid and Abet Illegal Migrants https://t.co/UCEnTT5DjW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 2, 2018\nThe Slovak leader concluded the interview on a positive note, expressing his relief that the rise of anti-mass migration parties and sentiments in Austria, Italy, and the German state of Bavaria, where the regional sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is putting the Chancellor under pressure to strengthen the border or face a walkout from her fragile coalition government.\n“Thank God that after all these years this problem is beginning to become visible; we should have woken up a long time ago,” Pellegrini said.\n“We’re only just beginning to realise that the real priority is defence of the borders, and that we must call a halt to the processes which are underway, otherwise the European Union can harm itself.”\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/06/29/slovakia-backs-hungary-migrant-crisis-not-prepared-suffer-mistakes-others/"}
