Reuters\nThere's no recession indicator more talked about right now than a yield-curve inversion.\nWall Street has been captivated as the curve, which plots the difference between long- and short-term bond yields, has slid to its lowest levels since the financial crisis.\nNotably, the difference between two- and 10-year yields fell last week to as low as 24 basis points, an 11-year trough. The gap has turned negative before every recession since the 1960s.\nIf the curve's flattening continues and Morgan Stanley's forecasts are right, the yield curve will invert next year, meaning short-term interest rates rise above long-term rates. Economists aren't in agreement that it would signal a recession this time. Still, an inversion would gather \"a big bear party,\" according to CLSA, a top trading firm based in Hong Kong.\nAs the bears come out to play, CLSA has a simple recommendation for investors looking to profit if and when the curve inverts: buy global bond proxies.\n\"A curve flattening/inversion cycle bodes well for high-yield strategies, benefitting bond proxies the most at the expense of GARY (growth at reasonable yield),\" the firm wrote in a recent note.\n\"Indeed, in line with our preference for defensive growth, bond proxies delivered strong performance in 2Q18 and could remain in favor against a backdrop of rising macro volatility and growth slowdown.\"\nCLSA\nA yield-curve inversion on its own doesn't cause recessions. But it signals downturns because it shows the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates too aggressively, lifting short-term yields above long-term ones.\nCLSA finds that bond proxies, stocks with bond-like yields, have outperformed during inversions. To screen for the best companies, their criteria included stocks with dividend yields of at least 3%, and positive free-cash-flow conversion on average over the past five years. Stocks in telecoms, utilities, and pharma led the list.\nIn the US, companies included Wisconsin Energy, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Coca-Cola, and Hershey.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/yield-curve-inversion-stocks-recommendations-2018-7"}
