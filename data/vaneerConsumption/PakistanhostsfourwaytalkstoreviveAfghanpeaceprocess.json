They said their first priority is to end their differences. In my opinion the splinter Rasool group will come but the presence of Mansour's group is very important, so let us wait to see how they react.\"\nBut despite the internal rifts and the onset of winter, when the Taliban traditionally break off fighting, the insurgents are still staging brazen attacks.\nIn September they briefly seized the northern provincial capital of Kunduz, and in recent weeks they have seized large swathes of the key opium-rich district of Sangin in the southern province of Helmand, their traditional stronghold.\nObservers say the intensifying fighting highlights a push by the militants to gain greater concessions during any future direct talks.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393268/Pakistan-host-four-way-talks-revive-Afghan-peace-process.html"}
