It struck a similar deal with pilots that will boost profits in 2017.\nThe agreements put an end to strikes that had repeatedly paralyzed the airline's fleet last year.\nLooking ahead, Lufthansa predicts a rise in fuel costs and sinking ticket prices.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319228/German-carrier-Lufthansa-sees-profits-rise-2016.html"}
