Lee, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\nThe defaced monuments are along the city’s famed Monument Avenue where dozens of statues memorializing various Confederate generals, soldiers, and other notables from later eras were erected beginning in 1890 after the passing of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\nUnlike the Davis and Maury statues, the Lee statue had “KKK” sprayed on it, as well as an expletive directed at Donald Trump.\nThe defacement occurred as dozens of millennial-aged marchers coursed through the streets of Richmond protesting against the peaceful transfer of power in Washington D.C.\nRichmond police spokesman James Mercante told the media, “Richmond police detectives take vandalism very seriously and remind everyone that any vandalism that is $1,000 or more in damages can result in a charge of a felony.”\nAt least ten protesters were arrested for blocking roadways during the unruly protests in Richmond on Wednesday.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/11/10/confederate-monuments-defaced-with-anti-trump-graffiti-in-richmond-virginia/"}
