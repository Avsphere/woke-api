Chelsea had Pennsylvania stops in Chester, Morton, West Chester, Norristown, and Elkins Park. As she made the various stops on the campaign trail, the internet was buzzing about what was revealed in the WikiLeaks emails in regard to her use of foundation funds and resources for her personal financial use.\nAccording to Breitbart News’s Jerome Hudson, “Former top Clinton Foundation staffer Doug Band wrote a letter to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta warning him that a probe into Chelsea Clinton’s use of ‘foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade’ could hurt the entire organization, according to a WikiLeaks email dump.”\nThis amazing group of volunteers is headed out to canvass in Norristown, PA! #ProudToBePA pic.twitter.com/QWgfkicapm — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) November 6, 2016\nChelsea spent Sunday convincing voters why her mother is the right choice for America. She also spent time targeting undecided voters, millennials, and minorities, and she attempted to convince them that Donald Trump was not the answer America needs.\nChelsea Clinton has been a very public figure of her mother’s campaign since her original run for president in 2008.\nIn the final day of campaigning before Election Day on Tuesday, Chelsea was doing all that she could to get her mother elected, but at the same time, she was battling opposing questions about her own mishandling of funds and living off of the foundation.\nPennsylvania is one of the most important states for both candidates.\nChelsea Clinton in Norristown says keep knocking on doors and keep talking neighbor to neighbor!!
