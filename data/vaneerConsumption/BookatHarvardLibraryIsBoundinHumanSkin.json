By looking carefully you easily distinguish the pores of the skin,\" he wrote. \"A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering: I had kept this piece of human skin taken from the back of a woman.\"\nHoughton Library first reported the skin-crawling news last May, but it wasn't until Wednesday that an expert at the university could confirm it.\nBy taking microscopic samples from the binding and analyzing it through peptide mass fingerprinting, a technique that identifies proteins to create a peptide mass fingerprint (PMF), analysts were able to pinpoint its source.\nThe PMF \"matched the human reference, and clearly eliminated other common parchment sources, such as sheep, cattle and goat,\" said Bill Lane, director of the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource Library.\nBut, he added, other closely related primates, like apes and gibbons, were not able to be eliminated using that technique alone. So samples were further analyzed to determine the order of amino acids; the results made it \"very unlikely that the source could be other than human,\" Lane said.\nThis is the only book at Harvard known to be bound in human skin. Similar tests on books at the law school and medical school library found books bound in sheepskin.\nBinding books in human skin was not unheard of in the 19th century. According to Harvard, there are numerous accounts of bodies of executed criminals being donated to science, and their skin being given to bookbinders and tanners.\nâ€” Elizabeth Chuck","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/book-harvard-library-bound-human-skin-n123291"}
