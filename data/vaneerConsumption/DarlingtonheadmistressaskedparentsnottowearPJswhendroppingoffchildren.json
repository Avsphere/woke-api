Six years ago, in January 2010, a Tesco store in Cardiff posted a new dress code for its shoppers.\n'To avoid causing embarrassment to others,' announced posters at the store's entrance, 'we ask that customers are appropriately dressed when visiting our store.' For clarification, they added: 'No nightwear is permitted.'\nThe headmistress of a primary school in Darlington sent out a letter asking parents to refrain from wearing pyjamas when dropping off their children (pictured, one of the schoolchildren's parents)\nOvernight, as it were, British society has turned pyjamaphobic. Sadly, this puts me in an uncomfortable position. For some time now, I have been an 'out' pyjama-wearer, or, to put it another way, I am openly pyjamist, a pyjama-alarmer from way back.\nOperating from home, I remain in my pyjamas until I have finished my work for the day. Then, and only then, do I slip into something more formal, like an old T-shirt and a pair of jeans, and I really only do so to avoid raising eyebrows in the street.\nI rarely get out of my pyjamas until the afternoon. This makes me prey to disapproving glances from people who come to the door, such as delivery men.\nPolite though it was, headmistress Kate Chisholm's broadside against the pyjama-dwelling community will, I'm afraid, have the effect of lowering our status still further in the eyes of most people.\nThe internet is already chock-a-block with extremist comments in support of her pyjamaphobia. 'Totally agree with her. Let them be named, photographed and shamed,' writes Colin from Birmingham.\n'I don't even put my dustbin out without getting dressed,' boasts Plum from Cornwall, while Jan from Leeds complains of 'bone-idle slobs', adding: 'What's going on in this country?'\n'What ever happened to personal pride?' writes Dom from the Cotswolds. 'And how can they still be in jammies at that hour?'\nHeadmistress Kate Chisholm (pictured) wrote: 'I have noticed there has been an increasing tendency for parents to escort children to and from school while still wearing their pyjamas and, on occasion, even slippers'\nIt dawns on me that, like so many others, I am now a member of a persecuted minority, destined to live my life in the shadows. My only hope is that those of us wedded to our pyjamas will eventually be accepted by other outsiders, and that, together, we can fight for LGBTPJ rights.\nWhy have we pyjamistas got such a bad name? It can't all be put down to the loud-mouthed, platitude-spouting vicar on Gogglebox in her jim-jams and fluffy slippers. There must surely be a deeper reason.\nCertainly, there are hazards to wearing pyjamas. Men's pyjamas, in particular, are often made with a perilously wide V in the fly area, making the wearing of them in public without the back-up of a robust pair of underpants a potentially imprisonable offence. This could be remedied by the development of a new Code of Conduct for manufacturers, allowing for the provision of less panoramic PJs.\nOn the other hand, it's not as though we have been short of good role-models. Most Sundays over the past five or six years, the Earl of Grantham has been graciously parading about in his pyjamas in Downton Abbey, and no one has ever called him a slug-a-bed, or complained that they ever glimpsed more of his body than was artistically valid. Likewise, Morecambe and Wise often appeared in pyjamas together, and it seemed to make them all the more lovable.\n'Pyjamas are the most peaceable of clothes. No one in pyjamas has ever called for a bomb to be dropped or a country to be invaded,' writes Craig Brown\nYet we continue to be marginalised and sidelined from places of influence. Even though it is transmitted late at night, I have yet to spot a single person on the panel of BBC1's Question Time in pyjamas. Or are some of them secretly wearing pyjama bottoms? Is that what the Question Time desk is for?\nSurely it's the case that if all the panellists were encouraged to wear pyjamas, they would undoubtedly feel less tense and more relaxed.\nThis, in turn, would make their opinions less forthright, their tone less bullish. It is impossible to take yourself too seriously in a pair of stripy pyjamas.\nTo take just one example: if the contenders for the Republican U.S. presidential nomination were all obliged to swap their stiff blue suits for pyjamas and dressing-gowns, then this would be followed by a marked downturn in their testosterone levels.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3420266/The-secret-world-peace-Wear-pyjamas-CRAIG-BROWN-defends-peaceable-clothes-Darlington-headmistress-asked-parents-not-wear-PJs-dropping-children.html"}
