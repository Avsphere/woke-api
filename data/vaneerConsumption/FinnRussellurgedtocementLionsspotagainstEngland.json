The Ford/Farrell axis is absolutely crucial to England's game at the moment. Farrell also gives you an option at fly-half, so there is your three picks already.\n'However with Biggar and Finn knocking at the door, it is up to Finn to force Gatland's thought process on whether he can take a risk on him.\n'There is a good charisma around Finn but also the odd question mark.\n'There is some immaturity in his play. His tactical kicking is not always as good as it should be at times and he is about to go into a cauldron, which is a big challenge.\n'But big players deliver on the big stage and Saturday is Finn's opportunity to show he is a big player.'\nHastings believes that Scotland have a great opportunity to beat Eddie Jones's side\nIt is 34 years since a Scottish XV last sacked London and emerged victorious.\nBut Hastings was part of two squads which came closer than most in the capital - first earning a 12-12 draw in 1989 before letting the opportunity of a rare Grand Slam success slip through their fingers in 1995 when they went down 24-12.\nHowever, he hopes this is the year the Scots finally end the hoodoo.\n'The record has got to crack some day but what a great opportunity Saturday is,' he said. 'If I was one of those players I'd be absolutely itching to get out there and try to take the game to England.\n'That's what the '83 squad did and that's what every other side since have been trying to do but haven't quite managed it. In '89 we came close, while in '95 we had the chance to win a Grand Slam but didn't take our chances.\n'But there were opportunities in those games and if Scotland can take theirs this week, they will have a great shout.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-4300778/Finn-Russell-urged-cement-Lions-spot-against-England.html"}
