But not always. The political majority (currently Democrats) can waive the normal rules and jam bills through at the last minute with little public scrutiny. It’s not uncommon for lawmakers and lobbyists to write brand-new bills in the session’s final days and push them to a vote before the public has much chance to weigh in.\nWhat would it do?\nProp. 54 tries to put a stop to last-minute law-making by requiring the Legislature to publish a bill in print and online for at least 72 hours prior to a vote on the bill. (The measure makes exceptions in cases of public emergency.) It also would require the Legislature to video record all its public sessions and make video archives available online.\nWhat would it cost the government?\nRoughly $1 million to $2 million initially for equipment, plus about $1 million annually for making the videos and storing them online.\nWhy is it on the ballot?\nCharles Munger Jr., a prominent Republican donor from the Bay Area, paid to put this measure on the ballot.\nWhat supporters say:\nIt would make government more transparent by giving the public time to review bills before they become laws.\nWhat opponents say:\nAdvance notice could cause delicate political deals to unravel by giving interest groups ample time to lobby legislators before they vote.\nSupporters:\nCalifornia Common Cause California Common Cause\nCalifornia Republican Party California Republican Party\nLt.

Here’s some background on how it goes down: Capital Public Radio explains the ritual known as “gut and amend.” A Pepperdine economist says the practice is “at odds with advancing citizens’ welfare.”\nA Democratic political consultant argues against Prop. 54, saying it would give Republicans and business interests “the power to blow up legislation they don’t like.”\nMunger, the Prop. 54 backer, has a long history of supporting Republican candidates and ballot measures that seek to weaken labor unions, the Los Angeles Times reported in this profile.\nNewspaper Editorials:","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/proposition-54-last-minute-lawmaking/"}
