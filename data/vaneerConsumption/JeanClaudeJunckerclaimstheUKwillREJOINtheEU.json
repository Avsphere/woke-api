'The Brexit issue is encouraging the others to continue, unfortunately without the British,' he said.\nA senior EU official later insisted that the option of Britain returning to the EU 'will always be open'.\n'There are different ways you can join,' they said. 'You can be a full member, you can be a partner, you can be related to us in the customs union, or through a trade agreement.'\nEU leaders - without British Prime Minister Theresa May - struggled to draft a declaration due to be unveiled at the March 25 summit in Rome to mark the club's 60th birthday.\nGermany and France backed a 'multi-speed' EU after Britain's divorce with the union, with Chancellor Angela Merkel saying: 'The motto is that we are united in diversity.'\nBut Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said: 'We disagree with any talk of a multi-speed Europe.'\nMs Szydlo took aim at bigger member states who 'believe that they have the right to impose solutions, but we as newer members are entitled to have a say too'.\nThe tensions came as the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator signalled Brussels would back down on its demand that Britain pays a £52billion divorce bill when it leaves the EU.\nAfter Mrs May warned she would fight the bill, Guy Verfhofstadt admitted the hefty sum was a bluff that EU negotiators would be forced to compromise on.\nThe Prime Minister warned European leaders on Thursday that the British people did not vote for Brexit only to keep sending huge sums to the EU.\nMr Verhofstadt conceded the bill was not set in stone and would be the subject of a 'political negotiation'.\nMr Juncker was immediately ridiculed by Eurosceptics including Nigel Farage who joked that the EU will have already 'sunk by then'\nTheresa May gave a press conference after attending a Brussels summit last night. She could trigger Article 50 and begin the formal Brexit process as early as next week\nThe former Belgian prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I have done enough negotiations in my life as a politician - as a prime minister, as a member of the European Council and member of the European Parliament - to know that at the beginning of negotiations that the positions, there is an enormous gap.\n'That's why I find it will be possible to find an agreement. I hope so.'\nEU negotiators have claimed the country will be on the hook for projects it signed off as a member after it leaves, as well as pensions for Brussels officials.\nBut the Government's legal advice states that there is no law or treaty that will compel Britain to make payments after Brexit.\nMrs May said last night: 'I'm clear that the way people voted on June 23 for us to leave the European Union, they voted for us in the future not paying huge sums of money into the EU every year.'\n'And of course when we leave the EU that will be the case.'\nMr Verhofstadt said that Britain's departure was 'a crisis for the European Union'. 'That Britain goes out of the European Union is, in my opinion, a tragedy, a disaster, a catastrophe,' he said.\n'But it gives us also a responsibility to look for a new partnership between the UK and the European Union.'\nHe warned that MEPs could scupper any Brexit deal because the European Parliament has the power to veto any agreement brokered between the UK and the European Commission.\n'We vote No - that is possible,' he said. 'It has happened in a number of other cases that a big international multilateral agreement was voted down by the European Parliament after it was concluded.\nMEP Guy Verhofstadt said he believed the UK's departure from the Brussels club was a 'tragedy' and a 'catastrophe' for both sides\n'The fact that in the Treaty it is stated we have to say Yes or No doesn't mean that automatically we vote Yes.'\nMr Verhofstadt suggested Britons could choose to keep elements of their EU citizenship after Brexit, although other figures in Brussels have questioned how this would work in reality.\nHe said: 'All British citizens today have also EU citizenship. That means a number of things: the possibility to participate in the European elections, the freedom of travel without problem inside the union...\n'We need to have an arrangement in which this arrangement can continue for those citizens who on an individual basis are requesting it.'\nHe claimed to have received more than a thousand letters from UK citizens who do not want to lose their relationship with 'European civilisation'.\nMr Verhofstadt's admission of the problems facing the EU was echoed by Polish prime minister Beata Szydlo who said Brussels was confronted with a 'profound crisis' because it has 'stopped focusing on the citizens of Europe'.\nSpeaking at the summit in Brussels, Mrs Szydlo said 'Europe is not moving in the right direction... things have not been going well'.\nShe argued that without the reform, 'the EU will continue to divide rather than unite'. 'The EU is facing a crisis of principles, it needs a deep reform and to reflect,' she added.\nMeanwhile, a close ally of Angela Merkel yesterday said the City of London would be allowed to keep providing many financial services to the rest of the EU after Brexit as it is superior.\nHans-Peter Friedrich, a former German interior minister who chairs the Brexit working group within Mrs Merkel's CDU/CSU coalition partners, told Bloomberg: 'There are financial services that you have to leave in London simply because London is better at them.\n'We have to find ways to make these services available to the EU, too. Hence, we need a matter-of-fact discussion.'\nHowever, Mr Friedrich said Germany 'cannot accept' that the UK would be allowed to retain all its rights to provide financial services throughout the bloc.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301494/Jean-Claude-Juncker-claims-UK-REJOIN-EU.html"}
