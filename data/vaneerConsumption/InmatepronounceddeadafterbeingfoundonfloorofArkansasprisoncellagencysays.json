The Cummins Unit, the state's largest prison, is just down the road from Varner, a maximum security facility where five inmates died over just a matter of days last month.\nThe Department of Correction said it suspected at least some of the deaths at Varner were the result of drug use. But spokesman Solomon Graves said Wednesday that there is “nothing conclusive” to suspect drugs played a role in Martin’s death.\nHis body was sent to the state Crime Lab for a post-mortem examination.\nMartin was serving a 20-year sentence out of Cleburne County for possession of meth.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/sep/12/inmate-pronounced-dead-after-being-found-floor-ark/"}
