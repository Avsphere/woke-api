Tsarnaev's lawyers said they are appealing his conviction and sentence and the trial judge's denial of a request to publicly release the jurors' names\nThe 22-year-old was convicted last April and sentenced to death last May in the 2013 bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 260\nThe 22-year-old's defense team filed a motion in August calling for a new trial, saying that widespread outrage over the attacks meant he was denied a fair hearing.\nThe team provided a long list of public events held in honor of the victims, including a new city holiday and several races, as evidence of 'continuous and unrelenting publicity'.\nHis attorneys argued that a new trial should be held outside of Boston to increase Tsarnaev's chance of getting an impartial jury.\nThis month the judge denied Tsarnaev's bid for a new trial after lawyers attempted to argue that his original jury was biased\nHowever, O'Toole ended up denying the motion, saying the issues his attorneys raised had been resolved prior to his trial last year.\nTsarnaev was convicted last April and sentenced to death last May in the 2013 bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 260.\nHe is being held at the 'Supermax' high-security prison in Florence, Colorado.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422889/Lawyers-Boston-Marathon-bomber-file-notice-appeal.html"}
