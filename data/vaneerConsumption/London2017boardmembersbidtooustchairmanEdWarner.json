Some members of the board have expressed disquiet about the lack of distinction between London 2017 and UKA, the governing body for the sport in Britain.\nIt is thought they considered issuing a vote-of-no-confidence against Warner late last year but according to a source are ‘very determined to see it through’ this time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-3420265/London-2017-board-members-bid-oust-chairman-Ed-Warner.html"}
