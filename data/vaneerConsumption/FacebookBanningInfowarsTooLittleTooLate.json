Facebook laid out its rationale for unpublishing Infowars’ pages in a blog post titled “Enforcing Our Community Standards,” accusing the news outlet of violating the platform’s “hate speech and bullying policies.”\nPolgreen’s reaction to the news implied Facebook was too slow to ban the pages. “Facebook finally boots Alex Jones and InfoWars. I suspect this will be received as too little, too late,” she wrote.\nFacebook finally boots Alex Jones and InfoWars. I suspect this will be received as too little, too late. https://t.co/g18iCDME4b — Lydia Polgreen (@lpolgreen) August 6, 2018\nThe news site’s lead story blared a similar sentiment: “FACEBOOK FINALLY GIVES INFOWARS THE BOOT!” read its top headline.\nFacebook says the decision came after it received complaints related to Infowars posts — and its decision was based on the use of “dehumanizing language” to “describe people who are transgender, Muslims, and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.”\nThe tech giant insisted that accusations of “fake news” were not a factor in this decision. “While much of the discussion around Infowars has been related to false news, which is a serious issue that we are working to address by demoting links marked wrong by fact checkers and suggesting additional content, none of the violations that spurred today’s removals were related to this,” Facebook said in a statement.\nOn Sunday evening, Apple announced they were removing entire catalogs of InfoWars podcasts from iTunes, including the news outlet’s flagship program, the Alex Jones Show.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/08/06/huffington-post-editor-in-chief-facebook-banning-infowars-too-little-too-late/"}
