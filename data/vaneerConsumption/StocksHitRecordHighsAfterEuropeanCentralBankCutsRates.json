The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nStocks gained on Thursday, with both the Dow and the S&P 500 setting records, after the European Central Bank slashed rates and investors looked ahead to Friday's employment report.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed unofficially 98 points higher, at 16,836.11, eclipsing its record high from Monday. The S&P 500 rose 12 points to close at 1,940.46, above Thursday's close. The Nasdaq added 44 points.\n\"This was a historic move by a major central bank,\" Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said of the ECB's decision to cut its key lending rate to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent and the overnight deposit rate to 0.1 percent from zero, as policy makers attempt to fend off deflation in the region.\nThe added measures that have the ECB offering banks cheap, long-term funding so long as they use it to hike lending to companies were intended to provide \"liquidity into the corporate marketplace, where banks have been reluctant lenders,\" said Luschini.\n\"Now we're looking at tomorrow's unemployment report.
