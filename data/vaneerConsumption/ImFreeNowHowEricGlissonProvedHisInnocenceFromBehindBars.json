The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nWhile Eric Glisson languished in New York's Sing Sing prison for a murder he didn’t commit, the years ticked by and the world moved on: Cell phones emerged and became ubiquitous, his baby girl grew up, and the authorities didn't seem very interested in reexamining a case they considered closed.\nBut Inmate 97A7088 wasn’t about to give up. And with the unlikely help of a nun who believed his story and a corporate lawyer who took the case, Glisson found the real killers on his own—and exposed a miscarriage of justice that freed not only him, but others unjustly convicted as well.\n“You're not gonna convict me for something that I didn't do and just expect me to accept it. I'm gonna fight to the end,” Glisson told Dateline correspondent Josh Mankiewicz in a report that airs Friday. “I’m a fighter.”\nDateline’s report, 'A Bronx Tale,' airs Friday June 6 at 9 p.m. ET.\nGlisson and five others were sentenced to 25 years to life in connection with the 1995 murder of a livery cab driver in the Bronx, based solely on the testimony of one unreliable witness. All six were freed by last year after serving nearly two decades behind bars.\nThe story of how Glisson went from a bleak future of bars and concrete to fresh air and freedom is one of perseverance, the dogged pursuit of justice and an answered prayer that came in the form of a surprise jail visitor.\nGlisson recalls: “He said, ‘I – I’m sorry. I know you’re innocent. Listen, I know the guys who committed this crime.’”\nDateline producer Dan Slepian found Glisson in 2012, a week after that visitor delivered the shocking news, while doing a story on another unjustly imprisoned inmate at Sing Sing.\nGlisson’s nightmare began on Jan. 19, 1995, when a livery cab driver, Baithe Diop, was found shot dead in the Bronx by murderers who stole his cell phone and cash.\nWeeks after the murder, a woman named Miriam Tavares told police she saw the crime from her bathroom window, knew who the shooters were and heard what they said. One of the names she gave police was Glisson’s.\nBased on that testimony Glisson was arrested, later convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life.\n“I didn't believe that I would be convicted of a crime that I didn't do,” Glisson told Dateline. “It's like your heart just — just melts. It just dissolves. You actually think that, you know, they read the wrong verdict. That this can't be true.”\nIn all, four men and a woman would be convicted and sentenced to life in prison for Diop’s murder. A sixth was charged but acquitted in the cab driver murder, but sentenced in another killing that police believed was related to that crime.\nBy 2006, Glisson was feeling hopeless. He’d been in prison for 11 years and had exhausted all his appeals. Then he met Sister Joanna Chan, a Catholic nun who volunteers at Sing Sing and is known to inmates as “Grandma.”\n“I told her, \"Grandma, I just lost my last appeal. I don't know what I'm gonna do,\" Glisson said.\n“I always say, \"Eric, let's keep the faith. You know that there're many sisters praying for you,’\" Chan recalled.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/im-free-now-how-eric-glisson-proved-his-innocence-behind-n123966"}
