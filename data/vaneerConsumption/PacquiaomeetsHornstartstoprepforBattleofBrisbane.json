Their world title bout is scheduled for July 2. (AP Photo/John Pye)\nPacquiao and Horn met for the first time Wednesday at the venue where local promoters are expecting a crowd of 55,000 for the WBO welterweight world title bout.\nThat, at least according to veteran American promotor Bob Arum, would beat Pacquiao's biggest live crowd to date - 50,994 at Cowboys Stadium in Texas\nSuncorp Stadium, usually the home ground for the Brisbane Broncos in Australia's National Rugby League and the annual State-of-Origin rugby league grudge match, has witnessed pretty of brawls, but none of them sanctioned like this one.\nPacquiao is putting his WBO title on the line against Horn, a trained teacher who took up boxing because he was bullied at high school, had his first professional bout in 2013, and is 16-0-1.\n\"If you ask inside my heart, I have confidence to win the fight, but I'm not taking it lightly,\" said Pacquiao, who has 11 major world titles and has a record of 59-6-2, with 38 knockouts. \"I'm not underestimating him.\"\nSince losing to Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas in April, 2015, a fight which generated a world record 4.4 million pay-per-view buys, Pacquiao has had two fights - wins over Tim Bradley and Jessie Vargas on either side of a brief retirement. The win over Vargas in November earned Pacquiao his third reign as the WBO welterweight champion.\nWhen Pacquiao arrived in Australia, he said he didn't know a lot about Horn, but knew the 29-year-old Australian had the kind of style that would make for an entertaining fight.\n\"I want an opponent that wants to fight toe-to-toe, throwing a lot of punches, aggressive,\" Pacquiao said. \"My style is to throw a lot of punches and I believe that will be very effective for Jeff Horn's style. That's why I accepted this fight.\nArum, who sat beside Pacquiao at the news conference Wednesday and first saw Horn fight in New Zealand last November, compared the bout with a young lion lying in wait to challenge on old one.\n\"This fight certainly has that theme,\" he said.\nThe packed news conference was a new experience for Horn, who says he's raw compared with Pacquiao but raring to go.\n\"He's done so much. He's fought a lot of champions,\" Horn said. But, \"If he underestimates me, he's going to know about it July 2. It's going to be a very tough fight - he's going to see that.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4446526/Pacquiao-meets-Horn-starts-prep-Battle-Brisbane.html"}
