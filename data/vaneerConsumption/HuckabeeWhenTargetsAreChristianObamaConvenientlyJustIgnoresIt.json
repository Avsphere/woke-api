Mike Huckabee (R-AR), a candidate for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, discussed Obama’s response to the shooting in Oregon and said the president “conveniently just ignores it” or “denies” that Christians were targeted according to reports.\nHost Steve Malzberg asked, “What if the shooter had said are you a Muslim, and shot those in the head who were Muslim. Do you think the president would have mentioned that yesterday?”\nHuckabee said, “Of course he would have. The president always wants to be defensive and tell us there is no such thing as Islamic terrorism and these are not religious people, even though we all know they are. But when it seems that the target is a Christian, he conveniently just ignores it, denies it, or just moves onto something else. I do think it was incredibly significant that there was a religious intent and motive in this shooters attitude.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/02/huckabee-when-targets-are-christians-obama-conveniently-just-ignores-it/"}
