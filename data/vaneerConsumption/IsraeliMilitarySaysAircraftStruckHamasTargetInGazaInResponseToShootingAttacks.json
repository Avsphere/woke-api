No injuries were immediately reported in Monday’s strike.\nThe military says shots fired from Gaza hit Israeli army vehicles along the border on two separate occasions over the weekend.\nThe border with Gaza has remained mostly quiet during a nearly three month-long wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence. However, several Palestinians have been killed in violent clashes along the frontier and some rockets have been launched at Israel.\nIsrael fought a 50-day war against Hamas last year, which killed more than 2,200 Palestinians. On the Israeli side, 73 people were killed.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2015/12/07/israeli-military-says-aircraft-struck-hamas-target-in-gaza-in-response-to-shooting-attacks/"}
