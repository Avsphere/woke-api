He was badly hurt but alive.\nMonday night, Hubert’s mother listed her son’s injuries on Facebook: paralysis on his left side, blood on the brain, broken vertebrae, broken ribs, broken scapula and punctured lung.\nBut he is responding to family and friends, flashing a peace sign to his brother and stroking a friend’s beard in a photo and video posted on social media.\nDiane Hubert said she was hopeful the paralysis would be temporary.\nShe said her son was in “a lot of pain but on morphine and resting.”\nHubert left the formal alone and was taking MARTA home, but was “jumped, beaten up, robbed and left for dead,” Diane Hubert posted on Facebook, adding that he was not drunk or high on drugs when he was attacked.\nAt a news conference shortly after Hubert was found Monday morning, Atlanta police Lt. Charles Hampton said while investigators had not found any evidence of foul play, Hubert has not been coherent enough to tell detectives what happened.\n“Once he gets to a state that we can interview him, we will ask him more information to further our investigation,” he said.\nGeorgia Tech police Chief Robert Connolly Monday praised Hubert’s classmates for not giving up on their friend.\n“The students rallied together and then they started searching,” Connolly told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “The students stayed out until midnight [Sunday] night, putting out pamphlets and combing the area, anywhere they could possibly find [cell phone] pings along the route.”\nThe students “were not going to stop,” Connolly said. “They checked every hospital, every hotel, they checked everywhere. They didn’t give up on their friend.”","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/mom-once-missing-georgia-tech-student-paralyzed-one-side/qkzYQO6PNo0aGHLLu9AFyJ/"}
