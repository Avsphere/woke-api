Igleheart and the teen exchanged messages on an app where he allegedly asked her to send pictures of her genitals and talked about masturbation.\nIn one message, according to the warrant, he talked about how her breasts had been smaller when she was younger, but had grown over time.\nNo one answered the phone at a number listed for Igleheart’s home, and a message was not immediately returned on Friday.\nIgleheart was taken into custody at Northlake Mall. A search warrant was served at the hotel and his home on Thursday; another will be served at his place of business in Roswell today.\nIgleheart, 53, was elected to the council in 2001 and sits on the environmental/public works committee, according to his profile on the city’s website . His current term ends Dec. 31, 2017.\nRoswell city officials said they are aware of the arrest, but have no comment “at this time.”\n“We just don’t have enough information at this point,” spokeswoman Julie Brechbill said.\nCity councilman Donald Horton said he doesn’t have any of the details and didn’t “want to comment on anything.”\nRoswell’s city charter says an elected official shall forfeit his office, among other reasons, if he is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. Additionally, removal of an elected officer from office may be initiated by a two-thirds vote of the entire membership of the council. Igleheart would have to be given written notice specifying the grounds for removal and a public hearing would be held. The council would need to vote unanimously to remove Igleheart, though he would not get a vote.\nAccording to Igleheart’s city profile, he was named to Georgia Trend magazine’s “40 Under 40,” has a degree from Furman University and completed graduate coursework at the University of Georgia.\nIgleheart, who is married, lists his occupation as an actor/consultant.\nIgleheart appeared in DeKalb County Magistrate Court Friday afternoon. Bond was set at $30,000 and he was told not to contact the teenager.\n“We will not tolerate these types of crimes against our children,” DeKalb Public Safety Director Cedric Alexander said in a statement. “The protection of our children is a priority.”\nHe said the arrest was the result of work from the county’s Internet Crimes Against Children unit.\nIf anyone has any information they are asked to contact the DeKalb Police Special Victims Unit at 770-724-7710.\nTo read more, click here.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/roswell-councilman-igleheart-accused-year-relationship-with-teen/fSpy3Ceg88MHqnfFS5AfYM/"}
