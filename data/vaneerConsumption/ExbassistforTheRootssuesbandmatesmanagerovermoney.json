That was two years before The Roots became the house band for Jimmy Fallon's late-night show.\nHe says in the suit filed Wednesday in Philadelphia that an agreement was made in which he would continue to get paid as a co-owner. He claims his compensation began to dwindle and operations were transferred to a newly created company.\nHe's accusing them of misrepresenting earnings and paying themselves disproportionately high salaries.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421669/Ex-bassist-The-Roots-sues-bandmates-manager-money.html"}
