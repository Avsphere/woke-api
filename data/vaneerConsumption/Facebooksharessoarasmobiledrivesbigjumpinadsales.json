'They're making big investments and evidenced by their quarterly performance it seems to be working.'\nThe company, which has the world's most popular smartphone app, has also been benefiting from a surge in video views that has attracted advertising dollars.\nFacebook said it had 1.59 billion monthly active users as of Dec. 31, up 14 percent from the end of 2014. Of those, 1.44 billion used the service on mobile devices, an increase of 21 percent.\nAnalysts had expected the company to report 1.58 billion monthly active users, with 1.43 billion accessing the service through smartphones and tablets, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3420049/Facebook-shares-soar-mobile-drives-big-jump-ad-sales.html"}
