A new T20 competition involving eight teams to be introduced in 2020https://t.co/bVrkla9HcB pic.twitter.com/jb27fBQGOF — England and Wales Cricket Board (@ECB_cricket) April 26, 2017\nAfter the new tournament was approved by a margin of 38 votes to three, ECB chairman Colin Graves said: “We are delighted that such an overwhelming majority of our members have voted to support the change to the ECB’s Articles.\n“In doing so, they have paved the way for an exciting new era for cricket in England and Wales.”\nThe new competition will complement English cricket’s existing domestic competitions, including the NatWest T20 Blast.\nEach club will receive a £1.3million annual share of the tournament’s revenue in its first four years.\nChairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board Colin Graves thinks the new competition will rival the IPL and Big Bash league (Anna Gowthorpe/PA)\nBut Essex and Middlesex had openly rejected the changes, while Kent abstained in the vote amid concerns about the impact on counties without Test-status grounds.\nHowever, Graves feels the new competition will rival both the highly-successful Indian Premier League and the Big Bash League in Australia.\n“Over the past year our members have seen the clear evidence outlining why an additional new T20 competition is the right way for cricket to reach new audiences, create new fans and drive the future of the game,” Graves told the ECB’s website.\n“I would like to sincerely thank them for the way they and their members have embraced the process and the debate.\nEssex have rejected the changes (Adam Davy/PA)\n“I passionately believe that the game has chosen the right path. Each of our members will benefit and, critically, so will the whole game.\n“We can now move on with building an exciting new competition for a new audience to complement our existing competitions – NatWest T20 Blast, Royal London One-Day Cup, the Specsavers County Championship and Kia Super League – plus the international formats, each with its own clear role to play.\n“Our clear ambition is that this new competition will sit alongside the IPL and Big Bash League as one of the world’s major cricket tournaments.\n“It will certainly increase participation in our game, in conjunction with the new All Stars Cricket programme for five to eight-year-olds, and provide additional income streams for all our stakeholders.\n“The ECB executive and T20 development team will now continue to work with the game as we build the new competition, ensure it is positioned distinctively from our existing competitions and realise its full potential.\n“All decisions – including the creation and base of each team – will be made within the game, guided by our shared strategy and built on best practice, research and insight.\n“The benefits it will bring can deliver a sustainable future for all 18 first-class counties and an exciting future for the game in England and Wales.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4447590/ECB-Board-receives-overwhelming-vote-city-based-Twenty20-tournament-2020.html"}
