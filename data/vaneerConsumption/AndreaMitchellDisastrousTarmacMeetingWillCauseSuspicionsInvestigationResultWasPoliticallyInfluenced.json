That is branding her in advance. The tarmac meeting such unforced error. Inexplicably Bill Clinton the smusher-in-chief, ‘oh here is a motorcade, let me go over there,’ something should have told this former Constitutional law professor form Arkansas not to do it. Something should have told Loretta Lynch to tell Mr. President, ‘let’s go down,’ it was 108 degrees into the tarmac, they could have walked into the terminal. To be on that plane for 30 minutes, no matter what happens if exonerated she’ll be — there will be suspicion, not only among, you know, the Donald Trump people but among a lot of other people. There will be suspicions it was politically influenced. This is absolutely disastrous decision on their part.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/07/03/andrea-mitchell-disastrous-tarmac-meeting-will-cause-suspicions-investigation-result-was-politically-influenced/"}
