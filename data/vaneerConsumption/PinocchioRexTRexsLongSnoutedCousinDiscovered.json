Although big and at the top of the food chain, the long-nosed dino wouldn't have been able to \"crunch through bone\" like T. rex, Brusatte told Live Science.\nLong-nosed dinos\nResearchers previously found the complete skull and parts of the neck, back, hind limbs and tail of the new dinosaur, Qianzhousaurus sinensis, at a construction site in the Nanxiong Formation in southeastern China.\nThe new specimen had a long snout with many teeth, and horns on its nose. The creature probably weighed a little less than a ton and was probably 25 to 30 feet (7.5 to 9 meters) long, compared with a full-grown T. rex, which weighed about 5 tons and was about 40 feet (12 m) long, the researchers said.\n\"It really is a beautiful specimen,\" Brusatte said.\nBrusatte and colleagues said Pinocchio Rex was a \"top predator\" in its ecosystem, likely feeding on small, feathered dinosaurs or lizards.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pinocchio-rex-t-rexs-long-snouted-cousin-discovered-n99351"}
