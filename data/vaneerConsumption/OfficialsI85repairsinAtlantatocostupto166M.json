The estimate includes $3.1 million in incentives for contractor C.W. Matthews to complete the work before June 15, although it must complete the project by mid-May to get the full amount.\n___\nAnd earlier version of this story incorrectly said construction of the new bridge is expected to cost $1.6 million.
