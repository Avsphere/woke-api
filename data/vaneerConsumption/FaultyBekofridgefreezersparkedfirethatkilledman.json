Mr Wilson, who had recently had a lung transplant, died in hospital three days later\nThe blaze was made worse after the flames spread to Mr Wilson's oxygen tank, causing it to explode\nThe property was severely damaged after the fire spread to an oxygen tank Mr Wilson needed following his lung transplant, causing it to explode.\nTen people were hurt in the blaze in August 2016, including his wife Hazel, 53, and some of his neighbours who came to his aid at the property in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.\nAccording to the Manchester Evening News, his daughter Danielle, 23, 'clung to an upstairs window after the floor fell through', before she managed to pull herself up onto the roof.\nShe also leapt to the ground and was left with broken ribs and a punctured lung but survived.\nMr Wilson, pictured, also suffered from type 2 diabetes and needed a mobility scooter to move around\nIt is understood around 500,000 Beko fridge freezers made between 2000 and 2006 have a fault with the defrost timer that can cause a fire.\nMiss Wilson and her mother lost everything in the blaze and are still housed in temporary accommodation as they wait for work to begin on rebuilding their home.\nMiss Wilson also suffered serious burns and had skin grafts on her feet, which left her unable to walk.\nShe said: 'My dad would still be here if they had properly recalled all these machines.'\nJames Bolton, of law firm Leigh Day who represented the Wilson family at the inquest, said: 'This is a harrowing case.\n'It is crucial that manufacturers have effective methods for informing customers of safety notices and recalls and that they are persistent in their attempts to make customers aware of any problems.'\nA spokesperson for Beko said: 'Our sympathies are with the relatives and friends of Mr Wilson and his family.\n'We deeply regret any incident linked to one of our products. Extensive efforts were made to recall the product.\nEmergency services rushed to the scene with 10 people hurt, including Mr Wilson's daughter Danielle, 23, who also jumped from the building and suffered a punctured lung\nMr Wilson's family have backed calls for a full product recall while Beko said it had made 'extensive efforts' to tackle a fault with the defrost time that has affected around 500,000 machines made between 2000 and 2006\n'We want to reassure our customers that the product involved in this incident has not been produced since late 2006 and none of our current range of appliances are affected.\n'We have modified almost 200,000 of the 492,000 relevant products and estimate that, given the age of the products, the majority are now out of the market.'\nVisit beko.co.uk/safety or call 0800 917 2018 to check whether you have an affected Beko fridge freezer.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446798/Faulty-Beko-fridge-freezer-sparked-fire-killed-man.html"}
