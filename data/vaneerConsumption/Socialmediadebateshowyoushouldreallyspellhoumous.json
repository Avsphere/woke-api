In American English, 'hummus' is almost always used.\nSocial media users have been tweeting furiously about the Sainsbury's houmous crisis, after the supermarket was forced to withdraw many of its products due to a 'taste' issue\nDozens of people have been tweeting about the lack of houmous at Sainsbury's stores across the country, jokingly comparing it to a 'catastrophe'\nBut in the end, both spellings are technically correct - making it confusing for fans of the dip.\nSainsbury's said in a statement yesterday that it hopes the withdrawn products will return to shelves by tomorrow.\nMailOnline has asked the supermarket for an update.\nM&S told The Telegraph yesterday: 'Some of our houmous products were temporarily taken off shelf due to a supplier issue. We can reassure customers that our recipe hasnâ€™t changed and that houmous is now back in store.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-4446980/Social-media-debates-really-spell-houmous.html"}
