Sleeping with a fan and AC blowing directly on my lips quickly evaporates all their moisture, causing me to wake up each morning with a dry, cracked pucker. I've actually gone through more Burt's Bees lip balm this summer than I did this past winter; not only is my wallet unhappy about that, but my lips are still crying their same sad song: \"We're chapped and annoyed!\" Having smooth lips isn't just the foundation for any good make out sesh, it's also the basis of keeping your lips youthful and healthy.\nSmearing on lip balm all day, every day is not going to be your ticket to kissable, strong lips. In fact, medicated lip balm, which has long been a stand-by for most of us during chapping weather, contains phenols that actually dry out your lips in the long run. That old wives tale about being addicted to ChapStick actually has some truth to it: You may find yourself needing more and more ChapStick, but it isn't because you've become a junkie. Those \"cravings\" are due to the products that contain petroleum, which can diminish our lips' natural ability to produce moisture on its own. A natural lip treatment will continuously put moisture back into your lips instead of sucking it out.\nOur lips take some serious abuse. We breath in that city air and then we breath it right back out onto our lips. We share kisses, drinks, and smokes with people and hope for the best. We spend hours getting our hair thick and shiny, our skin clear and even, and our teeth strong and bright. It's no wonder that with all the daily maintenance needed to keep a beautiful, healthy bod, that lip health tends to go ignored. Fortunately, there are more companies coming out with plant-based lip balm and serums that aid in keeping the most important area of our face nourished. My fave OTC product right now is Fresh's Sugar Lip Serum Advanced Therapy, it's moisturizing and BONUS: It fights against premature aging on and around the mouth area.\nFresh Sugar Lip Serum Advanced Therapy, $35, Amazon\nOf course, if your bank account can't handle lip couture right now, then you can get into the kitchen and amp up your lip health game. These recipes below will exfoliate, rejuvenate, and help make those smooches less brittle and more supple.\n1. DIY Sugar Lip Exfoliate\nLip care starts with exfoliating, and don't let anyone tell you different! Having a stand-by exfoliate twice a week will remove dead skin cells and promote healthy, moisturized lips. Pretty Gossip's site has a great exfoliate that is easy on the lips and your purse. Below is my take on the recipe:\n1 1/2 teaspoons of brown sugar\n1 teaspoon of organic cocoa butter or shea butter\n1 teaspoon of extra-virgin coconut oil\n1 teaspoon of raw, organic honey\nA few drops of vitamin E\nFirst put the brown sugar in a small container, then heat your shea and coconut together to get a liquid consistency in order to mix in the brown sugar easily. Then, add the raw honey and vitamin E and mix with your finger. Next, lick your finger if you choose and then wait for your mix to settle. Massage on your lips, getting the area around your mouth as well, and leave on for about three to five minutes. Rinse thoroughly.\n2. Lip Plumping Serum\nTrader Joe's Bourbon Vanilla Extract, $13, Amazon; Murray's Beeswax, $12, Amazon\nWhat would lip care be if we weren't trying to obtain the unobtainable? For extra sexiness, take about a half teaspoon of beeswax, add in some cinnamon and nutmeg, and apply on your freshly exfoliated lips.\n3. Lipstick\nA common mistake in lip beauty is applying lipstick directly on bare skin. Make sure your lips have a base before you add your color. My fave way to do that is by combining my base and color with a DIY lipstick. This recipe is serious, so I make a giant batch in order to avoid spending too much time in the lab...I mean kitchen. You can make your own lip balm by mixing beeswax, shea butter, and coconut oil together. Add color by using any natural dye such as beet root powder or black tea.\nPucker up!\nImage: Amazon; Kristin Collins Jackson; Giphy","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35305-diy-lip-scrub-serum-and-lipstick-recipes-to-get-a-naturally-pretty-pout"}
