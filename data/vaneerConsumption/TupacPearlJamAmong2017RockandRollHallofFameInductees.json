I think it was patience. We just had to be patient. I figured it would come around,” Cain told Billboard.\nMore than 900 Rock Hall voters cast their votes for this year’s inductees.\nThe 32nd annual Rock Hall induction ceremony will be held on April 7 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. SiriusXM will broadcast the ceremony live. The event will air on HBO at a later date.\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2016/12/20/tupac-shakur-pearl-jam-journey-among-2017-rock-roll-hall-fame-inductees/"}
