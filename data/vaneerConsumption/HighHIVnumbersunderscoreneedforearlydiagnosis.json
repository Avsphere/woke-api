That can be up to 10 years after they first became infected.”\nThose statistics got our attention.\nPolitiFact Georgia decided to check further.\nWe contacted Lyn Vaughn, risk communicator with Fulton County Health and Wellness, to ask the source of those statistics.\nShe provided with us links to, and excerpts from, two statements, one from the Centers for Disease Control and one she said was from the National Association of People Living with AIDS, the group credited with starting the national testing day.\nThe report from the CDC, issued in 2010, said nationally, the proportion of patients diagnosed with AIDS at or within 12 months of their HIV diagnosis in 2007 was 32 percent.\nWe tried to contact officials with the association to ask about the source of their statistics but were unsuccessful. We later learned from the group’s web site that the association filed bankruptcy and closed its doors after 30 years in February 2013.\nThe CDC, which supported National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) from its founding, continues to promote the annual event and advocate for routine HIV testing.\nAccording to the CDC, more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and almost one in seven or 14 percent are unaware of their infection. In the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, but the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable — at about 50,000 a year, the CDC reports.\nSo what about that statistic?\nVaughn later sent us additional information, including a recent news report on ongoing HIV testing available to patients who come through the emergency room at Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital.\nNot all of the patients agree to be tested. But among those who were diagnosed as HIV infected between July 2013 and February of this year, nearly half had AIDS, according to data we received from Grady.\nThe physician in charge of Grady’s program said many of the patients in the group that was subject of the report had been HIV positive for several years.\nThe other data we looked at came from the state Department of Public Health.\nIn Georgia, 24 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV patients in 2012 already had AIDS, the agency reported. That percentage also held true for 2013 as well, DPH reports show.\nWe also circled back to the CDC, where the most recent data available is for 2012.\nNationally, also, 24 percent of patients who were initially diagnosed with HIV infection were simultaneously diagnosed with AIDS, the CDC reported in 2012.\nMost of those people were likely infected for many years without knowing it, the CDC said.\nOur ruling\nThe press release from Fulton County Health and Wellness promoting testing for HIV states that almost 40 percent of people with the virus are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected.\nThat specific statistic reportedly came from a national organization that is no longer in operation and appears high compared to the 24 percent figure reported to us by the state and CDC.\nBut that still supports the health department’s overarching point about the need for early testing and treatment.\nFor that reason, we rate the statement Mostly True.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/high-hiv-numbers-underscore-need-for-early-diagnosis/vc8CMe7wanuWVP5IQyw4XO/"}
