He kept on at me about money and winning and power.'\n'He went backwards and all his body lifted his head, which he put on the back of my nose. I couldn't believe it, it was bleeding from my nose and mouth'.\nMr Ghadami suffered a broken nose after the shocking incident in the Royal Courts of Justice\nSaunders was found guilty of assault in January but it could not be reported until today because Mr Ghadami faced trial for racial aggravation after allegedly making an anti-Semitic slur against Saunders.\nSaunders claimed Mr Ghadami hit him 'in the balls' and called him a 'Jewish s**t', but the charge was dropped due to lack of evidence.\nMr Ghadami's son Joseph said his father needed surgery to fix a broken nose after the horrific attack.\nHe said he has trouble sleeping and is generally 'muddled and confused'.\nSaunders, of Maida Vale, avoided jail for the attack.\nAn email from Mr Ghadami was read the court which stated: 'Nothing less than serving in prison would be sufficient in order to punish Mr Saunders for the crime he committed.'\nSaunders, a leading property conveyance solicitor who was a partner in Marylebone-based law firm Saunders Bearman between 1996 and 2013, told police he acted in self-defence.\nThis image shows the moment Sauders headbutted Mr Ghadami at the Royal Courts of Justice\nSaunders, who was a witness in the £132m damages claim against the billionaire Candy brothers last week, appeared at Inner London Crown Court in a grey suit, white shirt and blue tie to face sentencing.\nDavid Nathan QC, representing Saunders, said the attack came about from a 'most unpleasant background going on for four years since the inception of these civil proceedings.'\nHe noted that the civil case had forced Saunders to give up his practice because his insurance premiums had gone 'through the roof' and said that 'up until the moment Mr Saunders headbutted Mr Ghadami, he was trying very hard not to react.'\nMr Nathan said Mr Ghadami had made a 'religiously offensive remark to Mr Saunders,' which had been 'spoken in anger and hate.'\nHe told the court that Mr Ghadami had told police that he called Saunders a 'piece of s**t' as well as 'words to the effect of 'don't be so Jewish.'\n'Jewish' and 's**t' featured in the abuse he flung at Mr Saunders in the moments before Mr Saunders reacted as he did.'\nMr Ghadami, whose son Davood plays Kush on EastEnders, had his nose broken and his eye injured\nMr Nathan claimed Saunders, who was a 'good and decent man', had been 'vilified in the press' and asked for the court to consider 'the impact this case has had, is having and will continue to have on Mr Saunders and his family.'\nHe added that Saunders had been taking antidepressants since the trial and had referred himself to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, where he will face disciplinary proceedings.\nHe also called into question Mr Ghadami's 'continuing problems associated with the injury' and said he was 'determined to pursue' a campaign against Saunders, which could provide 'some insight into what is happening on that CCTV and the amount of provocation.'\nPassing sentence, Recorder Gasztowicz said: 'You are a solicitor who has led a decent life and never been in trouble before.\nDavood Ghadami\n'However, on 7 April 2016 you assaulted a litigant in person in the High Court building, the Rolls Building, by forcefully headbutting him, causing a fractured nose.\n'Mr Ghadami sued you and a number of other people and the litigation had gone on for some time. It is clear that the litigation was a source of some nuisance to you.\n'After the hearing, you met Mr Ghadami in the public area of the Rolls Building and you unwisely began an altercation by commenting to him that you hoped he had the money to pay the costs of the litigation.\n'Mr Ghadami swung his pilot case towards you and was aggressive and used offensive comments.\n'What exactly was said, I cannot say, but it seems to have included a derogatory reference to your religion.\n'You completely lost your self-control, lent backwards and quite deliberately headbutted him. A jury rejected your contention this was done in self-defence.\n'It was clear that you could have left his presence without doing anything like that deliberate and serious assault, albeit on the spur of the moment.\n'There are serious aggravating features: the offence was committed in a High Court building, where any litigant is entitled to feel safe, however annoying he may be and whatever is going on between you.\n'It was committed by someone who was a solicitor, who is trusted to act properly in such buildings.\nPhilip Saunders, 69, lunged at businessman Mohammad Reza Ghadami (pictured) after he became enraged following a bitter £100 million legal battle\n'At the same time, I have to take into account the mitigating features. There was a considerable amount of provocation and some aggression from Mr Ghadami.'\nHe noted that the adverse publicity was 'entirely of your own making.'\nSaunders was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work.\nA five-year restraining order was imposed and Saunders was also made subject to a four-month curfew between 8pm and 6am and ordered to pay £5,000 prosecution costs.\nHe is now likely to be struck off the roll of solicitors.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301590/Furious-solicitor-HEADBUTTS-EastEnders-star-s-dad.html"}
