Now, after keeping the weight off for more than a decade, Jodie runs her own weight loss groups.\nShe said: 'Losing weight when I did completely changed my life. It gave me so much more confidence in every respect.'\nScroll down for video\nTransformation: Jodie Rigby Mee before her weight loss, left, and showing off her slim figure\nJodie said she was always two or three dress sizes larger than her friends as a teenager. 'Everyone always said I had \"puppy fat\", but I never grew out of it and when I went to college my weight became more out of control,' she said.\n'By that time I had my own money though so I could just buy clothes in the next dress size up and I avoided talking to anyone, including my parents, about my weight.'\nAged 17, Jodie, who is 5ft 6in tall, tipped the scales at 16st 7lbs. Her heavy frame meant she suffered with asthma, migraines and painful knees.\nWhen she started a job at Gap, she had to choose her uniform from the menswear section because none of the women's clothes fit her size 20 frame.\nBut it was only when she overheard two boys making a jibe about her weight while on holiday that she decided to make a change.\nShe said: 'It took my breath away and I ended up back in the hotel room in tears. I truly felt at my lowest.'\nAshamed: Jodie made the change after being branded the 'fat friend' on a girls' holiday\nUnhealthy diet: The mother-of-one used to binge on snacks, sausage rolls and crisps\nHer godmother, Marion, suggested they join Slimming World together in May 2002.\nJodie said: 'If I'm honest, I spent all day trying to think of excuses not to go with her. I thought everyone would really judge me for being so big at such a young age.\n'My fears were completely unfounded though and the truth is that you walk into a room full of people who all feel exactly the same way as you do and who totally understand what you're going through.'\nJodie began swapping her pre-packed sandwiches and jarred sauces for tasty, homemade options.\nLease of life: After losing weight, Jodie, left before, landed her dream job as an air hostess\nShe said: 'I'd tried other diets in the past, but none of them taught me anything about food. I'd \"spend\" all my allowances on unhealthy foods or end up starving hungry on shakes and pills. This was completely different.'\nHealth fears: Jodie suffered with asthma, migraines and painful knees while heavy\nAnd, after switching cheese baguettes with homemade butternut squash and crisps and chocolate with fresh fruit and fat-free yogurts, she lost an incredible 6st in just two years.\nJodie said: 'I was able to pursue a career as cabin crew, including moving to Dubai for five years and becoming a safety trainer teaching people how to put out fires, jump down slides and float on life-rafts, which I'd never have been able to do at my heaviest.\n'I married my husband in a Size 10 wedding dress, took part in a bikini photo shoot for a magazine and had a happy, healthy pregnancy with my little boy.'\nJodie, who reached her target weight in December 2005, keeps the weight off by going to the gym and running after her son Jenson, three.\nShe said: 'Running around after Jenson is also a good workout and my parents are keen walkers so we like going out together and it's made us closer too.'\nIn 2014, after moving back to Britain, Jodie decided to open her own Slimming World groups. She has now been named Top Target Consultant 2017.\nActive: Jodie goes to the gym and keeps active running after her son, Jenson\nVibrant: Jodie, who is now a Slimming World Top Target Consultant, with her son Jenson\nShe said: 'It's the most rewarding job I could ask for - I love seeing people reach a goal because I know exactly what that feels like.\n'I'm really honest with my members and they know I'm still a Slimming World member too - I attend a group every week to get support to stay on track, even after all these years.\n'I want them to know I'm human too and show them that Food Optimising isn't a diet to go on and go off, it's a plan for life.'\nDIET BEFORE Breakfast: Big bowl of sugary cereal with full-fat milk or sausage roll Lunch: Burger and chips or ham and cheese baguette with a bag of crisps and a chocolate bar Dinner: Chicken in a jarred sauce with deep-fried chips Snacks: Crisps, chocolate\nDIET AFTER Breakfast: Fruit with Quark or grilled lean bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms and baked beans Lunch: Homemade butternut squash soup with wholemeal bread or a jacket potato topped with tuna and salad Dinner: Homemade spaghetti Bolognese or stir-fry with Slimming World's Chinese 5-Spice Sauce, available from Iceland.
