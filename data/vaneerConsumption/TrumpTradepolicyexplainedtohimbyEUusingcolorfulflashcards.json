Reuters/Kevin Lamarque\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker reportedly used colorful cue cards to explain issues of global-trade policy to President Donald Trump during their meeting earlier this week.\nAccording to a report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday evening, Juncker and his team used the cards to simplify complex issues for the president as a means of getting their points across as effectively as possible.\nThe Journal's report says Juncker \"flipped through\" more than a dozen cards, which had minimal information on them, and all focused on a single issue. These included the automotive trade, and regulatory standards for medicines, the report added, saying that there were a maximum of three figures per card.\n\"We knew this wasn't an academic seminar,\" a senior EU official who was at the meeting told the Wall Street Journal. \"It had to be very simple.\"\nTrump and Juncker on Wednesday agreed to the beginnings of a deal that would end the previously growing trade tensions between the US and the EU.\nDuring the meeting, the EU agreed to import more American soybeans and liquefied natural gas. Both sides agreed to work to decrease industrial tariffs and adjust regulations to allow US medical devices to be traded more easily in European markets.\n\"This was a very big day for free and fair trade,\" Trump said at a press conference after the pair's meeting.\nThe EU's use of flash cards is not without precedent. Trump is well-known for his distaste for lengthy documents, and is said to prefer single-page memos when deciding on policy.\nIn May 2017, a report from Reuters said that Trump likes \"single-page memos and visual aids like maps, charts, graphs and photos.\" A source quoted by Reuters said aides also strategically put Trump's name into \"as many paragraphs as we can because he keeps reading if he's mentioned.\"\nYou can read the Wall Street Journal's full story, which includes further details of the meeting, here.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-tariffs-eu-colorful-cards-2018-7"}
