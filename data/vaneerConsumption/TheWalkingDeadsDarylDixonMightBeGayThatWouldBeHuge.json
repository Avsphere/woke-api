For everyone, that is, with the exception of Norman Reedus' character, Daryl Dixon. While Daryl has been a huge focus of the show, plots have never delved into his romantic relationships, while other characters have even gone so far as to get married. Sure, they've hinted at a possible somethin' somethin' going on between Daryl and Maggie's sister Beth, but nothing concrete has been said — and it looks like there might actually be a reason for that. According to The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman, Daryl Dixon might be gay.\nIt apparently came up during an interview with ComicBook.com , and Kirkman mentioned the show \"will tackle\" it.\nWhen asked about the possibility that Daryl is gay Kirkman said, ‘All I can say is that it’s been discussed.’\n‘We have very specific ideas about Daryl’s sexuality, or the seeming lack thereof, and if there’s ever a quiet period in the show where he’s not consistently distracted by crossbowing, we’ll tackle it in the show.’\nWhen asked if that was something the show’s producers would allow, Kirkman replied, ‘For the record, they absolutely would.’\nInteresting. Of course, this isn't concrete evidence or confirmation, but still, having a character who defies every stereotype of gay men, like Daryl, be revealed as gay — and to have a show not even focus on his sexuality or make it a huge plot point like other shows (*cough*cough*Glee) — is huge.\nAs for whether or not we'll find out this season, though...that remains to be seen. After all, The Walking Dead could go on for a while.\nSeason 5 of TWD will premiere on AMC on October 12.","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35848-the-walking-deads-daryl-dixon-might-be-gay-that-would-be-huge"}
