But David Kofi Aza, a well-known priest, said last month that an oracle named Fa had predicted dozens of deaths in post-electoral violence because the loser would refuse to cede to the winner.\nKing Daagbo Hounon (centre left), Chief of the Voodoo religion in Ouidah, walks through the streets during the annual Voodoo Day celebration on January 10, which had a very political tone this year\nA man in a trance dances with a sacrificed goat above his head during the annual celebration. But this year, the people who took part prayed for peace\nBut despite wishing for peace, there is still a brutal element to the voodoo religion, which calls for the sacrificing of animals\nBlood from a sacrificed goat that will be offered to the spirits as part of the tradition of voodoo, officially declared a religion in 1996\nA man blows liquid on a voodoo idol as hundreds of followers of the traditional religion gathered in the Atlantic coast town\nA photo shows a statue representing past kings in Benin, once an important port in the slave trade and still the centre of voodoo\nA man holds an ornate bottle containing what is believed to be sacred medicine in a religion with a dark reputation\nThe oracle did not reveal how the crisis would be resolved, Aza said, as people gathered in the Atlantic coast town of Ouidah, once an important port in the slave trade, to pray for calm.\nAt the ceremony in Ouidah, spiritual leader Daagbo Hounan Houna II appealed to the dead to help keep order during the vote. 'The elections will pass in a peaceful manner in the name of the bounties of the ancestors,' he said.\nFurther inland in Savalou, the hometown of Prime Minister Lionel Zinsou, priests and dignitaries set a chicken on fire at a ceremony before spreading its blood and palm oil on a fetish made out of cowrie shells and sand.\nThe election campaign has been overshadowed by a controversy over the ruling party's choice of Zinsou as its candidate, a pick approved by outgoing president Thomas Boni Yayi.\nThe tattoo of Mami Wata (Water Mother) is seen on a voodoo devotee at the festival which now attracts thousands of people\nHere, the followers leave the Sacred Forest of Kpasse Zoun in a day filled with ritual dances, goat sacrificing and gin drinking\nBenin's voodoo festival is held every year and is the west African country's most vibrant and colourful event\nBats are seen flying over the Sacred Forest of Kpasse Zoun. Many see the voodoo religion as a dark one, yet people prayed for peace as they look ahead at the presidential elections this year\nLast Tuesday, politicians from the opposition and dissidents from the ruling party met for discussions on the formation of a coalition to prevent Zinsou's run.\nZinsou is both French and Beninese and spent a large part of his life in France. Critics claim he is an outsider without a true understanding of the realities of life in Benin.\nBut he does enjoy local support. 'Diversity must be a richness and exclusion is a source of war,' Gbaguidi Tossoh, the king of Savalou, said at the ceremony there.\nBoni Yayi has been president since 2006, when he took over in a peaceful transition of power after 28 years under Marxist coup leader Mathieu Kerekou, who gradually came to embrace multiparty democracy.\nA voodoo devotee throws rum over a shrine made of broken glass bottles (left) and a man stands in front of a voodoo statue in the Sacred Forest of Kpasse Zoun (right)\nBenin has no history of significant electoral violence. But David Kofi Aza, a well-known priest, said last month that an oracle named Fa had predicted dozens of deaths in post-electoral violence because the loser would refuse to cede to the winner\nThe oracle did not reveal how the crisis would be resolved, Aza said, as people gathered in the Atlantic coast town of Ouidah, once an important port in the slave trade, to pray for calm.
