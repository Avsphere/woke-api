Immunologists had already counted more than 300 in the immune system alone. The eye's retina, other research showed, has more than 100. How many in the whole body? Regev won't even try to predict.\n\"People guess anything from the thousands to the tens of thousands. I'm not guessing,\" she says. \"I would rather actually get the measurements done and have a precise answer.\"\nFor the last two years Regev, a professor of biology at MIT, has been co-leading a massive international effort to get that answer. Called the Human Cell Atlas Consortium, the effort aims to account for and better understand every cell type and sub-type, and how they interact.\nThe Human Cell Atlas has received less attention than the $3 billion Human Genome Project, which was completed in 2003 after 15 years of work. But it's equally ambitious.\nRegev's co-chair, Sarah Teichmann, uses Legos as a metaphor for their quest.\n\"It's kind of like we're trying to find out what are all the different colors of Lego building blocks that we have in our bodies,\" Teichmann says. \"We're trying to find out how those building blocks — how those Lego parts — fit together in three dimensions within each tissue.\"\nLooking at all those building blocks, Teichmann and Regev say, will offer many new insights into how the body works and what goes wrong in disease.\nRegev and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital published their first major Human Cell Atlas finding earlier this month in the journal Nature. Working first in mice and then human tissue, they discovered that the lining of the windpipe — the tube that connects the throat and lungs — has seven cell types instead of the expected six.\nAnd that new type of cell could prove crucial for understanding and eventually developing a cure for cystic fibrosis.\nResearchers had believed that the disease was caused by a faulty protein made by a common cell in the windpipe's lining. But instead, the Broad-MGH team discovered that the bad protein is made in this rare, seventh cell type, which they named a pulmonary ionocyte.\nThe difference sounds small, but it could save years of wasted research effort trying to repair the wrong cell.\n\"It sort of changes the problem,\" says Dr. Jay Rajagopal of MGH and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, who helped lead the windpipe work. Another team of researchers, led by Allon Klein from Harvard Medical School and Aron B. Jaffe from the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Cambridge, confirmed the finding in a separate Nature paper.\nEven without knowing about this seventh cell type, scientists have been able to develop drugs that have given cystic fibrosis patients hope of living into middle age. \"The progress has been amazing,\" Rajagopal says.\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Montoro et al./Nature 2018/Broad Institute Montoro et al./Nature 2018/Broad Institute\nHowever, while the drugs treat the disease they can't cure it. A cure, Rajagopal says, will require targeting the precise cell where the faulty protein is made.\n\"Now that we have this new piece of the puzzle I think it will direct research that much more,\" he says.\nIn another new paper related to the atlas, British researchers reported Friday in the journal Science that kidney cancer in children starts in different cell types than kidney cancer in adults.\nOne of the technological advances that enabled the Human Cell Atlas came in 2014, when Regev and colleagues at Harvard — Steve McCarroll and David Weitz — made improvements to a technology called single-cell RNA sequencing, which reads the RNA in each cell to see which genes are active and identifies different cell types.\n\"All of a sudden, we moved from something that was very laborious and we could do maybe a few dozen or a few hundred, to something where we could do many, many thousands in a 15- to 20-minute experiment,\" Regev says. \"We said, 'That's at the right scale that we could actually do the human body.' \"\nRegev and Teichmann, head of cellular genetics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the United Kingdom, formed the Human Cell Atlas Consortium in late 2016. The consortium includes 500 scientists from around the world; projects related to the Human Cell Atlas have received $200 million from the National Institutes of Health.\nRegev says she got interested in the project because human cells are so fascinating. As soon as she realized she could feasibly count and analyze them, she wanted to dig in.\n\"There is nothing more remarkable than the cell,\" she says. \"It's the basic unit of life. It cannot be reduced to anything simpler — not the DNA, not the genes. It's this phenomenal entity that knows how to take many different pieces of information, make very quick and sophisticated decisions, act on them and continue on its way.\"\nRajagopal says he's also excited to learn more about how cells \"talk\" with each other.\n\"I tend to think of cell tissues really as, like, societies — where cells are the individuals and there's a lot of communication from one cell to another, and some cells are sensing the environment and then sending signals to their neighbors,\" he says. Technological advances are allowing the cell atlas researchers to eavesdrop on this \"conversation\" for the first time.\nMaking the atlas won't solve every problem in medicine, just as having the entire map of the human genome from the Human Genome Project didn't fix everything. But, Regev says, it's a good place to start.\n\"We knew the lessons from the Human Genome Project were [that] rallying together the entire community would really let you get a full answer to a question. And that full answer will empower everyone to do better and faster and higher-resolution biology,\" she says.\nTeichmann, who specializes in immunology, says she expects the cell atlas will take another five to 10 years to complete. But she sees possibilities for improving treatments for diseases – asthma, perhaps, or cancer.\n\"There is huge potential — huge potential,\" she says. \"You know there are very clear things that we can learn by drilling down to the single cell level in those diseases.\"\nThis story originally ran on WBUR's Common Health.

ve in improving quality of life, reducing depression and anxiety, and improving overall social functioning — results that are especially notable for a population at a startlingly heightened risk of suicide.\nFederal policy upends plans\nWhen Vetens searched for a graduate program in string theory, a subfield of theoretical physics, she insisted on finding a school friendly to transgender students.\nMadison seemed a welcoming place, a liberal island in a largely conservative state. The University of Wisconsin's campus there has an active LGBTQ center, and the UW Health System is building a program catering to trans patients.\n\"I just sort of expected they're going to be reasonable about this,\" Vetens says, \"and I guess I learned a bit of a lesson about naiveté.\"\nAlthough Wisconsin had specifically excluded coverage for \"gender reassignment or sexual transformation\" for state employees, its 11-member Group Insurance Board voted unanimously in July 2016 to overturn the prohibition, citing the new federal anti-discrimination rule.\nWhen she arrived on campus that fall, Vetens was told the state health insurance plan would cover her surgery once the new policy took effect on Jan. 1, 2017.\nThen came the surprise victory of Trump, who had built a campaign on rejecting Obama's policies and embraced social conservatives like his running mate, Mike Pence. As a congressman and governor, Pence opposed protections for the LGBTQ community, including an Obama administration directive ordering schools to allow trans students to use the bathroom correlating to their gender identity.\nWith the national momentum shifting, Vetens was home for the holidays when she learned that she'd lost the coverage she'd counted on to pay for her operation: In a meeting almost entirely behind closed doors, the insurance board voted to reverse its earlier decision. The board had caved to pressure from Scott Walker, the state's Republican governor, and his justice department, which had called the anti-discrimination rule \"unlawful\" before joining other states in a lawsuit against the Obama administration.\nThe dramatic policy swings, from the unprecedented expansion of trans rights under Obama to the unpredictable reduction of trans rights under Trump, have left many feeling the whiplash.\nTwo other transgender women employed by the University of Wisconsin and covered by the state health insurance plan have sued the Group Insurance Board, the university's board of regents and others, alleging sex discrimination based on their inability to get coverage for their procedures. The case is scheduled to go to trial in October.\nHealth care hurdles\nDetermined to have her long-awaited surgery, Vetens and her mother set out to buy another policy that would cover it.\n\"What's striking about it is the urgency this family felt about getting this procedure done, even without having some big questions locked down,\" says Katie Keith, cofounder of Out2Enroll, an organization that helps the LGBTQ community obtain health insurance, adding: \"If you don't get it now, how long do you have to wait, and what does that do to your mental state?\"\nVetens researched the procedure's price tag, estimating it would cost $19,000 to $25,000. She then secured new insurance that would cover up to $25,000, became a patient of Dr. Katherine Gast, a surgeon newly recruited by the University of Wisconsin Hospital, and scheduled the procedure during her winter break in her second year. Her insurer, Consolidated Health Plans, preapproved her operation.\nThen, about two months before her surgery, a hospital billing representative called: They had run the numbers and anticipated billing her insurer about $100,000. Vetens, who makes about $20,000 a year as a teaching assistant, could have been on the hook for as much as $75,000.\nThe phone call triggered months of turmoil as Vetens and Moreland fought to get the hospital and her insurer to negotiate a better price for a procedure that experts say costs $20,000 to $30,000 without insurance. Both hospital and insurer blamed the wide divergence in estimates on the fact that they had little experience in billing for a penile inversion vaginoplasty and didn't know how much it should cost.\nPaul Meyer, the chief operating officer for The Alliance — which negotiates prices with providers for Vetens' insurance plan — says it had never been billed for a penile inversion vaginoplasty, meaning it would not be able to offer patients like Vetens an \"off-the-shelf\" quote beforehand.\nMeyer says there was no negotiated rate for that procedure. Instead, it would be priced based in part on which of about 1,000 general categories it was grouped into — likely a grouping known as \"mental health disorder with O.R. procedure,\" he says. The price would further be determined by expenses like operating room supplies and other factors, such as how many days of hospitalization were required.\nAt one point, Gast, Vetens' surgeon, called Vetens and asked her to reconsider moving forward before figuring out how to pay for it, a plea Vetens described as \"a slap in the face\" from a critical ally who had lobbied the hospital and insurer on her behalf. It had been a difficult year, punctuated by the murder of one friend and the suicide of another, Vetens says. She was determined to have the procedure.\nIn frustration, a week before the scheduled surgery, Vetens and Moreland accepted a hospital offer to forgo using their insurance and pay $20,080 directly upfront as a package deal — even though the insurer says it would not reimburse Vetens for that kind of outlay.\n\"What's another $20,000 of debt for me being the person that I am?\" Vetens says. \"If that's the price that I have to pay to be myself, then so be it.\"\nVetens underwent a penile inversion vaginoplasty on Dec. 27, 2017, and is thrilled with the results. But mother and daughter — a physician and a physicist — remain stunned by the obstacles they faced, and worry about those who do not have the fortitude and resources to fight back.\nMoreland penned an appeal to Consolidated Health Plans, writing: \"We feel that this discrimination in billing/insurance coverage practices is specifically because [Vetens] is transgender.\" She pointed out that patients with no insurance would pay the same price they did and accused the insurer of treating Vetens differently than it would treat women seeking common procedures like hysterectomies.\nTransgender people experience a lot of inequality in health care, Keith of Out2Enroll says. Preventive care can be hard to get, with trans women struggling to get coverage for routine prostate cancer screenings, for instance. And insurers have commonly used exclusions for transition-related treatments to justify not covering any medical care for trans patients.\nUnder the Obama-era rule forbidding discrimination based on gender, trans individuals who ran into trouble could file complaints to the Department of Health and Human Services, which could intercede. Now that option is off the table.\n\"My case is unique in that I have enough privilege to still have a happy ending,\" Vetens says.\nBram Sable-Smith, of KBIA and Side Effects Public Media, contributed reporting.","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/08/02/634583749/shifting-federal-policies-threaten-health-coverage-for-trans-americans"}
