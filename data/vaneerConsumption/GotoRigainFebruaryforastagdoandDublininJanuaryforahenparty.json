This is followed by Amsterdam, Marbella, Ibiza and Edinburgh\nThe cheapest destination is Riga, at just £62 per night. This is followed by Budapest and Prague, at £68 and £78 per night, respectively.\nIbiza and Marbella are summer destinations, where up to £143 per night can be saved by visiting in off-peak months such as February and March.\nThe same is, surprisingly, true for Edinburgh, where a hotel costs £81 per night during January, but increases to £213 during the Edinburgh Festival in August.\nRiga and Budapest display the least seasonal price differences, with prices only varying by £23 or £27, respectively, over the course of the year.\nBy booking the stag and hen dos at the right time, there is a lot of money to be saved at some of the popular European spots\nRiga is a good choice for stag parties in August, just as it is a lot cheaper than others at the height of summer\nDenise Bartlett, UK Public Relations at Trivago said: 'With more and more Britons deciding to celebrate their stag or hen do abroad, we wanted to help travellers choose where and when to travel according to their budget.\n'With hotels ranging from £52 per night in Riga during February to £225 per night during Marbella in August, timeliness is essential when deciding on the destination. Up to £143 can be saved per night by travelling during the right month.'\nFive popular stag destinations (Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Riga, Prague and Budapest) and five popular hen destinations (London, Brighton, Dublin, Ibiza, Marbella) were selected for the study.\nThese tables reveal the average price of a hotel stay at five of the most popular stag and hen destinations in Europe throughout the year\nA spokesperson for Trivago added: 'We recommend visiting Edinburgh in November to catch the beginning of the Christmas markets. Amsterdam is best visited in July, where hotel prices dip slightly between June and August. Riga is cheap year round, so can be visited in August – when other destinations are usually more expensive.\n'Prague is also cheap year round, but hosts an impressive Christmas market in December. Finally Budapest, which is also cheap year round and can therefore be visited in September – another typically expensive month.\n'London can be expensive, so visit in April, before prices rise for the summer. Brighton, likewise, can be expensive in summer – visit in May when temperature begin to warm up.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3423104/Go-Riga-February-stag-Dublin-January-hen-party-cheapest-times-pre-wedding-European-stayovers-revealed.html"}
