Peter King (R-NY) questioned the leaks from the intelligence community about last month’s election and Russia’s involvement by mean of alleged hacking.\nAccording to King, those leaks were “absolutely disgraceful.”\n“It’s almost as if people in the intelligence community are carrying out a disinformation campaign against the President-elect of the United States,” King said. “It’s absolutely disgraceful.”\nKing went on to note there were leaks to the press, but Congress had been blown off as far as requesting information.\n“Somebody had the time to leak it to The Washington Post, but they don’t have the time to come to Congress,” he added. “It is the House Committee on Intelligence that has the absolutely jurisdiction over the CIA and the intelligence community. It is their job to come. They don’t have any choice.”\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/12/14/gop-rep-peter-king-almost-intel-community-carrying-disinformation-campaign-trump/"}
