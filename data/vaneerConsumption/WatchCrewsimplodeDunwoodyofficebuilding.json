A crowd of more than 100 gathered in field next to the main office of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to watch the implosion, which left a cloud of dust over that lingered over the site after a quick succession of explosions that dropped the office building.\nAll that's left is a pile of rubble.\nState Farm and developer KDC are developing the corporate campus, known as Park Center, adjacent to the Dunwoody MARTA station. The complex could one day house 10,000 workers.\nThe first tower opened last year.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/watch-crews-implode-dunwoody-office-building/iZnPJmTxmPswgoj4gJwEeL/"}
