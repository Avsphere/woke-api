They then escaped in the direction of a nearby railway station.\nThe identity of the three victims had yet to be determined, authorities said. No one else was hurt in the attack.\nInvestigations are still ongoing but a police officer told The Associated Press: “This is a local incident. It has nothing to do with Islamists or terrorism.”\nHe spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\nForensic teams could be seen going in and out of the cafe collecting evidence.\nThe attack comes a day after the town concluded celebrations of Fasnacht, the largest carnival in Switzerland.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/03/10/gunmen-kill-two-swiss-cafe-fleeing/"}
