Here's the chart as of 4.35 p.m. GMT (11.35 a.m. ET):\nMarkets Insider\nThe industrial production numbers compared to the forecasts of economists, who predicted a small expansion of 0.2%. On a year-to-year basis, industrial production contracted by 1.1%, against a forecast of 0.5% growth.\n\"In October 2016, total production is estimated to have decreased by 1.3% compared with September 2016. Mining and quarrying provided the largest downward pressure, due to ongoing maintenance reducing production in the oil and gas extraction industry,\" an ONS data release said.\nYou can see the long term trend of the ONS' index of production, below:\nOffice for National Statistics\nDuring the month of October (the ONS releases data on a one-month delay) manufacturing production slipped by 0.9%, against forecast growth of 0.5%, while on a yearly basis the sector shrunk by 0.4%, compared to an estimate of 0.8% growth.\nWhile the figures look pretty bleak for British producers, the ONS does warn that the figures are only one month's worth of data, so should not be over-interpreted, saying: \"You should note that we always warn against overly interpreting 1 month's figures.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ons-industrial-and-manufacturing-production-data-for-october-2016-12"}
