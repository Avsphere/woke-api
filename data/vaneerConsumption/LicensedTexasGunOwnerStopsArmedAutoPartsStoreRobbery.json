The attempted robbery occurred at the Jones Road store at about 9 p.m. Friday night, according to KHOU CBS11.\nThe gun owner, who is legally licensed to carry a handgun drew his weapon and entered the store as the would-be robbers were demanding cash from the store employees. He demanded the three suspects drop their weapons and get down on the ground.\nHe then held the suspects at gunpoint while Harris County Sheriff’s Office deputies were called to the scene. When the deputies arrived they took the three failed robbery suspects into custody.\nNo shots were fired and no one was injured in the incident.\nKHOU stated the deputies praised the LTC licensee for his actions in stopping the robbery before anyone was hurt. Deputies said they do not; however, recommend that people take this action as it could cause a shootout and someone could get hurt.\nThe three suspects will likely face felony charges of Aggravated Robbery with a deadly weapon in one of Harris County’s State District Courts. No bond information is available at this time on the suspects who were taken to the Harris County Jail for processing.\nTexas law allows a person with a LTC license to carry a handgun openly or concealed. The law also allows a person to use deadly force, or the threat of deadly force, to protect their own life or the life of others.\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
