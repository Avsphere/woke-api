I'm [very] #blessed. I love reading my horoscope, writing in my dream journal, playin' skeeball and being an amateur model.\n'I love pranking my sisters and watching Animal Planet on mute so I can do my own voiceover,' he adds. 'My stomach growls extra loud when I'm hungry but I can usually keep it quiet with a hefty supply of BBQ mac & cheese.'\nAnd it looks as though Kirby must also spend quite a bit of his free time working with editing software, as his pictures require some serious skill in order to ensure he is seamlessly inserted into the supermodel's most famous photos.\nAmong the images are some of Kendall's most-liked posts, including the photo of her lying on the floor, her dark hair shaped into hearts, which last year gained the title of most-liked photo on the site.\nCopycat: Kendall gives her mustachioed 'brother' a run for his money\nBig time: Kirby describes himself as an 'amateur model' in his Instagram biography\nFun in the sun: Kirby isn't quite as skilled as balancing on the edge of a boat, and captioned this image with, 'Felt like Leo in Titanic! The part where he drowned tho'\nTrending: Kirby also joins in with the popular throwback trend that Kendall loves by sharing this image of 'their' 17th birthday\nIn Kirby's version, he lies on the floor alongside her with his own hair also shaped into hearts and a caption reading: 'Brother/ sister static electricity is crazy, y’all! Sad they cut me out but s/o to Kendall's crew for making her look so flawless!'\nHowever, while Kendall's famous photo has over 3.4 million likes, Kirby hasn't quite reached such heights, and has thus far only managed to work his way up to just over 3,000 since posting his version just over six weeks after Kendall's.\n'She's a big celeb and stuff but we do normal stuff like make ice cream soup and yell at people from car windows and have breath-holding contests,' says Kirby. 'Normal sibling stuff. I guess I'm just really lucky.'\nThe series also sees Kirby appear in Kendall's famous topless shoot for GQ's May cover, and again laments not making the final cut.\n'Had a BLAST shooting for @GQ! Was bummed I got cut out of the final cover but is all good!' he said.\nIt's not the only fashion shoot Kirby has inserted himself into - he also has himself appear on Kendall's Calvin Klein New York billboard and turns Kendall and Cara Delevingne's LOVE magazine cover from 'Kendall on Cara' to 'Kendall on Cara on Kirby'.\nSibling time: Kirby claims that 'Kendall gives hats to anyone she thinks is cute!!' in this snap\nBonding with the family: Kirby appears to grip Kanye West's hand in this expertly-done Photoshop creation\nDidn't quite make it: Kirby wrote that while he 'had a BLAST shooting for @GQ' he was 'bummed' to not have made it onto the cover\nOut and about: It seems that Kirby regularly joins Kendall around on her jet-setting lifestyle\n'Bottom of the totem pole cuz I’m so strong! fun shoot tho, thnx Cara!' he wrote in the caption.\nHe even takes part in the throwback photo trend that Kendall is such a fan of by posting an image of the pair on 'their' 17th birthday, showing Kendall blowing out the candles on a cake which conspicuously only bears her name and image.\nIn the caption, the trickster wrote: '#TB to cheesin hard with sis on our 17th bday! can't believe how young we look LOL TIME FLIES.'\nKirby has also managed to get himself into videos that the Victoria's Secret model has posted, including having himself appear alongside her at a Sam Smith concert and magically replacing Cara Delevingne in a video lip sync of Rihanna's song Cake.\nLooking to the future, Kirby claims he will be taking the SATs after he 'lost a bet with Haley Joel Osment', adding: 'He's such a crazy dude! So I guess I gotta start studying??'\n'But I also got a couple of fun modeling gigs coming up and I'm trying to go on a trip to Candy Island with Brody and Brandon,' he says. 'Still not sure if they made it up but apparently our tickets are booked! Oh, and I got flute practice at 3:30pm if anyone can give me a ride.'\nGetting a grip: Kirby turns Kendall and Cara Delevingne's LOVE magazine cover from 'Kendall on Cara' to 'Kendall on Cara on Kirby'\nKeeping up: Kirby doesn't appear to have gotten the height genes from the Jenner side of the family\n'Catching rays with the baes': Sometimes Kirby keeps his distance from Kendall, Kylie and pals\nLiving the life: Kirby is seen joining his 'sister' and family friend Justin Bieber by the pool 'waiting 30 min after eating to swim'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3393330/He-no-trouble-keeping-Kendall-Man-says-model-s-secret-twin-KIRBY-Jenner-earns-social-media-stardom-expertly-editing-pictures.html"}
