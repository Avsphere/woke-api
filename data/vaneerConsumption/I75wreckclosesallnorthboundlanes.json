Tamba, who is in serious condition after being airlifted to Grady Memorial Hospital, told police traffic in front of him stopped and he tried to move to the lane to his left. The pick-up hit the right rear of the semi, which was driven by Jeffrey Cargle, 44, of Dallas.\nThe driver’s side of Tamba’s truck was forced under the semi, police spokesman David Baldwin said. A passenger in Tamba’s truck was not injured during the collision.\nThe crash is still under investigation, and anyone with information about the collision should call Marietta Police Officer Ben Wallace at 770-794-5266.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/man-seriously-injured-wreck-marietta/2VCIG72H1etTLUdgFAM23I/"}
