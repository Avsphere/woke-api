Paul Guerrucci said.\nThe man was found slain inside the Big Brother 2 Food Mart on Norwood Road in southeast Atlanta. He was attacked in the front doorway and in the video it looked as if he were locking up for the night, Guerrucci said.\n“It was a very violent incident,” he said. “The assailant then forced him back into the store, a struggle happened in the doorway and the assailant shot our victim multiple times.”\nPolice believe the suspect is dangerous and say anyone who knows his identity or his whereabouts should call 911.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-police-seek-suspect-store-clerk-death/pz3FTWc9WtNdO8ucjOtxzO/"}
