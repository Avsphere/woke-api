Apparently, this was incorrect information.\nOver the weekend, at least one student at the Houston-area Bush High School in Richmond tweeted to say an assistant principal said a letter or email was required from an imam for a Muslim girl to wear the traditional headscarf on campus. In the tweet, the student stated that school officials “didn’t want girls who aren’t Muslim to cover their heads so they are trying to make hijabis carry notes,” according to the Dallas Morning News.\nThe Fort Bend Independent School District released a statement this week indicating that Bush High School students were given “misinformation” about needing documentation to be able to wear the religious Muslim headscarf in school.\nFort Bend ISD released a statement to clear up the matter, saying: “We apologize for sharing misinformation on the requirement to have documentation in order to wear a headscarf at Bush High School. Documentation is not required to wear a headscarf for religious beliefs at Bush High School,” according to the Dallas newspaper.\nThe district also stated: “In Fort Bend ISD we celebrate our diversity and the rich traditions of our students’ religious beliefs. We appreciate our students bringing this issue forward, as it will allow us to have deep and meaningful conversations on religious expression and the overall climate on our campuses. When students feel safe and welcome in our schools we know they will learn and engage on a deeper level and reach their full potential.”\nOn Sunday, Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Charles Dupre followed up on the matter, tweeting an apology for the misinformation on headscarves purportedly shared at the high school. He said, “Documentation is not required to wear one for religious beliefs.”\n.@hanaaa36 I apologize misinfo on headscarves was shared at Bush HS. Documentation is not required to wear one for religious beliefs. — Charles Dupre (@superdupre) February 26, 2017\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/border/2017/03/01/texas-school-apologizes-hijab-flap/"}
