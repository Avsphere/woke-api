All this has serious implications in terms of Israel’s security.”\nThe Iraqi militia, which goes by the name Harakat al Nujaba, is trained by the elite Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and equipped with Russian-made tanks and Iranian rockets. The T-90 tanks were likely redirected from Russia through the Syrian army.\n“The declaration regarding the formation of the Liberation of the Golan Brigade is not only a media campaign, but the real goal of the movement,” said the militia’s secretary-general Akram al-Kabi.\nAccording to intelligence researcher Ronen Solomon, owner of the Intel Times blog, the militia’s name first surfaced in 2013 when it deployed divisions in Syria to secure Shiite holy sites.\n“That same year, the militia released a series of videos that expressed loyalty to the commander of the Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, and even adopted the resistance symbols of Hezbollah,” Ynet news cited Solomon as explaining.\nHarakat al Nujaba is one of several Iran-backed Shiite militias tasked with reinforcing Hezbollah’s presence in Syria and conquering strategic cities, and is credited for its role in the capture of Aleppo last year. According to Solomon, the militia’s activity “is coordinated with Russia, who has been providing the forces with aerial backup and assisting in transferring weapons of their production.”\nHarakat al Nujaba’s leader al-Kabi accused Israel of attacking his brigade in 2015, a claim that remains speculative. Last year, however, Israel’s foreign and defense legislative committee revealed that the IDF had stopped several Iran-directed attempts to move forces into the Syrian Golan Heights.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2017/03/13/iran-backed-militia-vows-to-liberate-golan-heights/"}
