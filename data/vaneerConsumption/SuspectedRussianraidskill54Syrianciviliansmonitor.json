The US-led coalition has been carrying out strikes against IS targets in Syria and Iraq since the summer of 2014.\nRussian backing has helped Assad's forces make significant advances in recent months and the Observatory said Thursday that regime troops had moved to within eight kilometres (five miles) of Al-Bab.\nIt was the closest pro-government forces had been to the city, a key IS stronghold in Aleppo, since 2012, it said.\nAl-Bab, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of the Turkish border, fell to rebel forces in July 2012 and was taken over by IS in November 2013.\nRegime forces are seeking to sever IS-held territory in Aleppo province from that held by the group in neighbouring Raqa.\nThe Observatory said last week that Russian strikes in Syria had killed more than 1,000 civilians, including around 200 children, since September.\nRussia has denounced accusations that its raids have killed large numbers of civilians as \"absurd\".\nThe Observatory says the US-led strikes have killed 322 civilians, including more than 90 children.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420585/Suspected-Russian-raids-kill-44-Syrian-civilians-monitor.html"}
