All are durable and reliable and each has certain characteristics that can make it stand out from the others.\nThe various guns cover a wide range of calibers–.380, 9mm. .40. Cal., .45 auto, .357 Magnum, and .38 Special–and present numerous options in weight, conceal-ability, and grip size.\nGlock 43\nThe Glock 43 is a concealed carry pistol pistol which weighs approximately 17 ounces unloaded. It is chambered in 9mm and is 100 percent pure Glock through and through. The Glock 43 holds six rounds in the magazine and comes with a magazine extension to allow persons with larger hands to find sure grip for all their fingers.\nThe Glock 43 is accurate, easy to carry, and ultra-dependable. And the recoil of the 9mm is not excessive.\nBreitbart News tortured a brand new Glock 43 last year–this included freezing it, dragging it behind a vehicle, burying it in sandy dirt to get as much grit in it as possible, and shooting about 500 rounds through it without a single cleaning. The gun is still being carried daily as a concealed carry pistol.\nApproximate price for a Glock 43 — $500 to $580\nKimber Micro Carry (Two-Tone) .380\nThe Kimber Micro Carry (Two-Tone) is a concealed carry pistol which weighs 14.8 ounces unloaded. It is chambered in .380 and resembles a miniature 1911 pistol, yet retains all the accuracy of a compact or full-size 1911. And the Micro Carry Two-Tone) holds 7 rounds, which is one more than the 6-round capacity commonly found in other .380 pocket pistols.\nThe Micro Carry (Two-Tone) has a hammer that must be cocked in order to fire the first round. The hammer can be cocked by racking the slide or by pulling the hammer to the cocked position with your thumb. This feature–a classic aspect of 1911 pistols–affords the person carrying the gun an added sense of safety against accidental discharge.\nApproximate price for a Kimber Micro Carry (Two-Tone) — $650.\nRuger LCR (.357 Magnum)\nThe Ruger LCR is a double-action revolver which weighs 17.1 ounces unloaded. The gun is offered in various calibers, but the one tested by Breitbart New was chambered in .357 Magnum, which is great because it gives concealed permit holders the option of using .38 Special rounds for far less recoil.\nThe LCR is a polymer revolver–thus the considerable weight reduction–and it’s mode of operation could not be easier: simply point and shoot. The simplicity of use makes this a good first gun for someone who feels any apprehension about buying their first concealed carry firearm. And in .357 Magnum or .38 Special +P, the gun has stopping power.\nThe Ruger LCR holds five rounds.\nApproximate price for a Ruger LCR (chambered in .357 Magnum) — $500.\nSpringfield XDS\nThe Springfield XDS is a concealed carry pistol which weighs 21.5 ounces unloaded. The extra weight in the gun–as compared to the Glock, Kimber, and Ruger–is due to the fact that the XDS is chambered in .45 auto. It is a concealed carry handgun in a proven, hard-hitting round.\nThe XDS comes with one 5-round magazine that fits flush with the base of the grip and one 6-round magazine that offers a grip extension. The gun is accurate and extremely reliable. And because it is chambered in .45, it gives concealed permit holders the opportunity to carry a compact gun with the stopping power of bulkier, full-size weapons.\nThe Springfield XDS is also offered in 9mm and .40 cal.\nApproximate price of a Springfield XDS — $500 to $600.\nKimber Ultra Carry II (Two-Tone)\nThe Kimber Ultra Carry II (Two-Tone) is a concealed carry pistol for those 1911 aficionados who continue to revel in the proven dependability of 1911 pistols. The Ultra Carry II (Two-Tone) has an officer frame with a 3 inch barrel. The gun weighs 25 ounces unloaded and holds seven rounds of .45 auto in the magazine, with one more round in the chamber.\nThe Ultra Carry II (Two-Tone) is extremely accurate and gun’s trigger is excellent. Breitbart News shot approximately 500 rounds through an Ultra Carry II (Two-Tone) during the fall and the gun operated flawlessly regardless of the type of ammunition we fed it.\nApproximate price of an Ultra Carry II (Tw0-Tone) — $850.\nRegardless of which gun you purchase for concealed carry–whether one of the five on this list or a different gun that fits you best–be sure you practice, practice, practice with the firearm. Become proficient with it so you know where your rounds are going in the event that you ever have to use the gun to defend your life or the lives of your family members.\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
