She said that Jack Burkman, via an intermediary, offered her tens of thousands to make up sexual assault claims against Mueller. ‚Äî Scott Stedman (@ScottMStedman) October 30, 2018\n13 days ago I received this tip alleging an attempt to pay off women to make up accusations of sexual misconduct against Special Counsel Bob Mueller.
