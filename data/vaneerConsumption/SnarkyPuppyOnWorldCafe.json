Snarky Puppy is in its element when it's performing live, and it's often recorded its albums that way: live in the studio, often with an audience.\nBut the new album, Culcha Vulcha, was recorded differently; the band built up bandleader, producer and bassist Michael League's compositions track by track in the studio. In this session, hear an interview with League and a live performance by a 12-piece version of the shifting band.","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2016/05/20/478839439/snarky-puppy-on-world-cafe"}
