'It's not an endorsement of Donald Trump's candidacy. I'm still running for president, we have the caucuses Monday night, but I'm delighted to join Donald Trump to salute veterans.'\nCNN confirmed that Rick Santorum, also participating in the undercard debate, would also join.\nScroll down for video\nHuckabee it is! Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is participating in tonight's undercard debate, said he would be heading over to Donald Trump's veterans fundraiser afterward\nFormer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum was the second GOP candidate to come out and say that he would be attending Donald Trump's veterans fundraiser tonight\nDonald Trump tweeted this morning that two candidates had reached out about attending his veterans, which he is holding instead of attending tonight's GOP debate\nDonald Trump went to war with Fox News Channel this week over host Megyn Kelly moderating the Republican debate. Trump claimed that Kelly was 'biased' and wouldn't treat him fairly\n'Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event at Drake University,' Trump had boasted this morning.\nHuckabee said he didn't talk to The Donald personally and doesn't know whether Trump's campaign or his own campaign reached out first.\n'And you know what, I didn't have anything going on at 8 o'clock tonight, I'll be done,' Huckabee added. 'So I figured, \"why not?\"'\nHuckabee and Santorum share a common bond in that they both have previously won the Iowa caucuses, though this year have failed to get anywhere near the head of the pack.\nWith many people expected to view tonight's political events in split-screen, flipping between Fox News and other networks, the two bottom tier candidates could get a boost from the extra time.\n'When I saw that idea I thought this is an opportunity to take lemons and turn it into lemonade,' Santorum said on CNN.\nGrowing up, the former Pennsylvania senator's parents worked for the Veterans Administration and so its deterioration affected Santorum personally.\nHe said, no matter the host, he'd show up to an event benefiting vets.\n'If Hillary Clinton would have asked me will you come to a fundraiser where you can participate and raise money for veterans [I'd attend],' Santorum said.\n'I frankly don't really care who is hosting it,' he continued. 'I'm happy to participate in it if I have time to do it and I do.'\nBefore Santorum and Huckabee came forward there was a guessing game of sorts about the identities of his mystery special guests.\nSpokespeople for Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Rand Paul gave Dailymail.com outright noes when asked about the veterans event.\nCarly Fiorina said she'd toss $2 million to veterans for the opportunity to debate GOP frontrunner Donald Trump . Like Huckabee and Santorum, Fiorina is participating in tonight's undercard debate\nSo did Carly Fiorina's people.\nHer spokeswoman Anna Epstein noted how Fiorina had tweeted a challenge to Trump last night.\n'Our campaign offered $2 million to veterans' causes to debate Donald tonight. No response. It's clear he was never serious about our veterans and Megyn Kelly isn't the only person he's afraid of facing,' it read.\nTrump announced Tuesday night that he was skipping the GOP debate, the last one before Monday's Iowa caucuses, maddened over statements sent out of the Fox News PR shop, which belittled his beef with debate moderator Megyn Kelly.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421458/Who-wanted-join-Trump-stage-tonight-Huckabee-says-s-Donald-touts-two-presidential-candidates-veterans-event.html"}
