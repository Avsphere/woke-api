The vote was 4-1 with Councilman Bud Leonard dissenting.\nThe change will allow to-go drinks in clear plastic cups limited to 16 ounces. It limits the provision to restaurants with alcohol licenses, bans selling drinks from sidewalk bars and puts the Park at City Center off-limits.\nThis was the first reading of the ordinance.\nThe council also approved a six-month extension of a detour on the popular Noonday Creek multi-use trail at Reeves Street because of an adjacent construction project that could pose a danger. Developer Walton Communities said construction had fallen behind due to a wet winter.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/woodstock-approves-alcohol-downtown/pPNYqY7ArpywR7MOax8akJ/"}
