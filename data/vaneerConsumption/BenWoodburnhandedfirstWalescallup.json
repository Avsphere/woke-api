He’s there on merit and we’re looking forward to having him on board.”\nBen Woodburn has been named in @FAWales' senior squad for the first time: https://t.co/hodQ8iGdIJ pic.twitter.com/Hjv0pyTgNi — Liverpool FC (@LFC) March 16, 2017\nAsked if Woodburrn had been selected to ward off potential interest from England, Coleman said: “There’s no need to do that.\n“It makes me laugh when people say we’ve got to get him in. If I thought it was too early for him I wouldn’t put him in because this is a big game for us.\n“There’s no knee-jerk reaction to cap him. He’s training with international players every day at Liverpool and technically he’s very good, he’s performing for one of the biggest clubs in football.\n“He’s on the periphery of the squad and he won’t be daunted by coming with us. But I see him as a Welsh international and he’s good enough to be there.\nBen Woodburn\n“If Ben wanted to play for England there’s absolutely nothing we could do about that. But we see him as an international player for Wales.”\nReal Madrid forward Gareth Bale is set to make his 21st successive competitive international appearance, having not missed a qualifier or tournament game since October 2013.\nBale had ankle surgery in November and has just completed a two-match domestic ban for being sent off against Las Palmas.\nThe 27-year-old has played just five matches since the end of November, but Coleman said his star player is ready for Dublin.\nColeman on Bale: He's fit. He’s in good form. He looked good in training. I’m looking forward to getting him back.#TogetherStronger#IRLWAL — FA WALES (@FAWales) March 16, 2017\nPaul Dummett (heel), Simon Church (hip) and Emyr Huws (hamstring) are all absent, while Ben Davies, Jazz Richards and Joe Walsh return to the squad.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4319946/Ben-Woodburn-handed-Wales-call-up.html"}
