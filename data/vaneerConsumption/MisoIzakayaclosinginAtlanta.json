Wong cited an inability to come to an agreement with the property’s owner over a new lease as the reason for the closure. The restaurant’s last day of service will be July 28.\n“That’s the nature of the business. You have to do what’s right for the business,” Wong said in a telephone interview.\nWhile he did not disclose what the increase in rent would be, he called it “enough that the numbers would not work.”\nIn addition, Wong stated that there were “issues with the space that wouldn’t allow me to grow.”\nWong opened Miso Izakaya in early 2009. Closing Miso Izakaya is bittersweet, yet he is pleased with its decade-long run. “For a restaurant, 10 years is a pretty long time. I’m just pretty happy I made it that far.”\n<","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/atlanta-restaurants/longtime-japanese-favorite-close-edgewood-this-month/Gp3bUaHmzCxqxLjTMf8W7L/"}
