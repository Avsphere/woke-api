Towels, soap, shampoo and detergent have all been donated to the school\nEast High School in Salt Lake City is where Disney movie High School Musical starring Zac Efron was filmed in 2006\nShe said she noticed several of them hanging around the theater department where they have two washing machines to use for their costumes.\n'They're always very sneaky and they come in during a Saturday rehearsal and hide down in the shop and do it while everyone is up rehearsing,' she said.\nMore than half the students at the school are on a fee waiver program, which means they often eat two free meals each day at school, KSL reports.\nMaughan said about 80 per cent of those students were from refugee families.\n'A lot of teens now are serving as caregivers, and they may not have the opportunity to shower in the morning, but they want to,' he said.\n'There's typically enough time where they can get breakfast and still shower and get ready for class.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301470/Utah-school-installs-laundry-room-homeless-students.html"}
