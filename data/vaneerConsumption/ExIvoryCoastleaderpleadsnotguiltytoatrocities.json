Dozens massed outside the court ahead of the trial, which is expected to last many months, and in Abidjan about 300 Gbagbo supporters packed into an events hall in the working-class district of Yopougon to watch the trial. Organizers sold T-shirts featuring Gbagbo's smiling face.\nThe crowd cheered loudly when Gbagbo and Ble Goude first appeared on the screen and when they pleaded not guilty. Some members shouted \"Liar!\" and shook their heads in disapproval as the charges against the two men were read out.\n\"I think we must free Gbagbo because he's the one who can bring peace to Ivory Coast,\" said supporter Armand Yapi. \"He has no place in The Hague. His place is here.\"\nAt the end of Thursday's hearing, Gbagbo supporters in the court's public gallery stood and cheered as he was led out of the courtroom, chanting \"Gbagbo President!\"\nA former university professor who founded an opposition party well before Ivory Coast embraced democracy, Gbagbo spent much of the 1980s in exile in France. After returning to Ivory Coast, he lost the 1990 presidential vote and spent six months in jail in 1992 for his role in student protests.\nHe came to power in 2000 in a flawed vote he himself described as \"calamitous,\" although he put off holding another one for a decade. In the 2010 race, Gbagbo placed first in the first round with 38 percent of the vote before losing to Ouattara in the runoff.\nProsecutors say Gbagbo and Ble Goude marshalled security forces, youth militias and mercenaries to attack groups perceived as Ouattara supporters.\nBle Goude was a \"self-proclaimed general of the streets\" who \"manipulated the youth with hateful rhetoric,\" Bensouda said.\nParam-Preet Singh, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch, called the trial a cautionary tale for leaders who commit atrocities to stay in power.\n\"Today, victims who suffered unspeakable crimes at the hands of pro-Gbagbo forces are one step closer to seeing justice,\" she said.\nActivists also cautioned that crimes allegedly committed by Ouattara supporters must be prosecuted.\n\"All those suspected of criminal responsibility for these horrific crimes, including current President Alassane Ouattara's supporters, must be brought to account through fair trials, either in-country or by the ICC,\" said Gaetan Mootoo, a West Africa researcher with Amnesty International.\nBensouda has pledged to bring both sides to justice.\n\"This is our first case to reach trial\" linked to Ivory Coast crimes, Bensouda said. \"There will be others.\"\n____\nAssociated Press writer Robbie Corey-Boulet in Abidjan contributed to this report.\nSupporters of Former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo and former minister Charles Ble Goude rally outside the International Criminal Court, rear, in The Hague, Netherlands, Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016.
