He has one of the most revered voices of our time — and at 75, even with his legendary lifestyle, it sounds as good as it ever has.\nIn this session, Crosby returns to World Cafe to play new songs from his recently released fifth solo album, Lighthouse — plus some classics from his past, including a new reworking of Joni Mitchell's \"Woodstock.\" His in-studio band features, among others, Michael League from Snarky Puppy, who produced the new album. I have no doubt that, by the end of the year, we'll count this among the very best sessions of 2017.","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2017/01/13/509516813/david-crosby-on-world-cafe"}
