And I don’t think that’s the case with golf … this ain’t Ali going at Frazier. They’re not throwing punches. They’re not tackling each other. They’re not in each other’s way. Golf is not a zero sum game. It’s more like a standardized test.”\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/04/11/espns-kellerman-golf-isnt-a-sport/"}
