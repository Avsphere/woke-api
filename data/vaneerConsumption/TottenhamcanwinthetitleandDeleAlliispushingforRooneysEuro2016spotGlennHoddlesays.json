If Leicester are in there, Spurs are certainly contenders as well.'\nMidfielder Alli has hit the ground running in the Premier League and has been a key player for Tottenham this season â€“ his ability was further evidenced with his stunning volley against Crystal Palace last Saturday.\nHoddle has been mightily impressed with the former MK Dons youngster and believes he is putting pressure on captain Wayne Rooney for a starting berth at this summer's European Championship in France.\nHoddle (left) believes England should play with a No 10 behind Tottenham striker Harry Kane\nHoddle says Dele Alli is pushing Wayne Rooney hard for a starting spot at Euro 2016\nAlli scored a brilliant volley against Crystal Palace to help Spurs remain in the hunt for the title\n'I like the idea of Rooney playing in the hole behind Kane and that's a role which would suit him at this stage of his career, but Alli is pushing hard to claim that position for himself at the moment.\n'There is always a lot of hype around young players who catch the eye and that is especially the case when they are English. Comparisons to myself are not something I want to get into and it would not help him to be compared to anyone.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3421024/Tottenham-win-title-season-Dele-Alli-pushing-Wayne-Rooney-hard-Euro-2016-starting-spot-says-Glenn-Hoddle.html"}
