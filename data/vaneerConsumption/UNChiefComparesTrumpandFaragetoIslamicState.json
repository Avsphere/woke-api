I lost my freedom in my fight for freedom, and I don’t want my country to lose its freedom as well.\n“That’s why we have to de-Islamize. Islam and freedom are incompatible whatever this Jordanian bureaucrat says.”\nThis morning, Mr. Wilders was found guilty of “incitement to discrimination” by a Dutch court. He branded the trial a politically motivated “charade” that endangered freedom of speech.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/12/09/un-chief-compares-populist-success-trump-farage-islamic-state/"}
