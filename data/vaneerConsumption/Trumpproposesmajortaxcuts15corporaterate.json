Doing big things never is,\" Cohn admitted.\n\"We will be attacked from the left and we will be attacked from the right. But one thing is certain: I would never ever bet against this president.\"\n- Taxing overseas profits -\nMnuchin declined to set a deadline for the reform passing Congress, but he said the administration was aiming to \"get this done this year.\"\nHe and Cohn said there was fundamental agreement on the core principles of the plan, although particulars were still being worked out with lawmakers.\nUS Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer speaks during a rally in front of the Capitol to call for a $15 minimum wage and rights to form unions\nA key element is a one-time tax on overseas profits, which Mnuchin said will \"bring back trillions of dollars that are offshore to be invested here in the United States.\"\nThat rate has yet to be finalized.\nAlso unclear is how current tax breaks for child care will be restructured.\nThe tax plan's impact on the deficit and debt will be key to winning backing on Capitol Hill.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan hailed the reform as \"progress,\" even though Mnuchin signalled it would not include a tax on imports, something Ryan lobbied for among fellow Republicans.\n\"It's basically along exactly the same lines that we want to go,\" Ryan said.\n- 'Explode the deficit' -\nDemocrats sounded an immediate warning to the White House.\n\"If the president's plan is to give a massive tax break to the very wealthy in this country, a plan that will mostly benefit people and businesses like President Trump's, that won't pass muster with we Democrats,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\nChief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn (L) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speak in the Brady Briefing Room on US President Donald Trump's tax reform plans on April 26, 2017\nHe also warned that a plan that dramatically shrinks tax revenues would \"explode the deficit.\"\n\"The only result of this plan will be a steep increase in our country's deficit while leaving working- and middle-class families in the dust,\" House Democrat Gwen Moore fumed in a statement.\nSome Republicans, particularly in high-tax states, expressed concern about the proposed repeal of certain existing provisions.\n\"I can't support it if it eliminates the property tax and state income tax deductions,\" Congressman Peter King of New York told AFP.\nAnalysts have said cutting the top marginal corporate tax rate by 20 percentage points could add $2 trillion or more to the deficit over a decade.\nThe administration has said its tax cuts will spur growth, bringing in tax revenues to make up the difference, a calculation known as \"dynamic scoring\" which the Trump administration supports.\n\"The difference between 1.6 percent, 1.8 percent GDP and three percent is staggering,\" Mnuchin said. \"It's trillions of dollars of revenues. It's tons of jobs.\"\nEconomists however say this growth effect is not supported by evidence from prior tax cut efforts.\n\"There has never been any single credible analysis of dynamic scoring that suggests that taxes pay for themselves,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and former head of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office who served in previous Republican administrations, told AFP.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4447842/Trump-tax-plan-cut-corporate-rate-15--treasury-secretary.html"}
