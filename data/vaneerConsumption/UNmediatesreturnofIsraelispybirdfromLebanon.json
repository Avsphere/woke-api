Citizens of the two countries are banned from communicating by law.\nConspiracy theories are endemic in the Middle East, particularly when it comes to Israel's spying activities.\nLast summer, Palestinian media reported claims by the Gaza Strip's Hamas rulers that they had apprehended a dolphin off their Mediterranean coastline, equipped with video cameras for an Israeli spying mission.\nIn 2011, Saudi media reported that a vulture carrying a GPS transmitter and an identification ring from Tel Aviv University had been detained by security forces who suspected it was being used for espionage.\nAnd in 2010, Israel's foreign ministry dismissed Egyptian reports linking a spate of Red Sea shark attacks to the country's Mossad intelligence agency.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3422482/UN-mediates-return-Israeli-spy-bird-Lebanon.html"}
