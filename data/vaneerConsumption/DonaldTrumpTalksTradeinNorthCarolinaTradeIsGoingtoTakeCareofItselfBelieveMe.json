Thank you very much.”\nNASCAR driver Mark Martin then came on stage and said, “Donald Trump has my vote. Lets bring these greatly needed jobs back to this country and build that wall. Make America Great Again!”\nTrump primarily focused on trade, referencing Ford and Nabisco moving their plants to Mexico. “This trade has bothered me for years and years,” Trump explained.\nHe slammed the unfair trade between China and Japan with the United States and pledged to bring jobs back to America. “The trade is going to take care of itself, believe me,” he vowed.\n“One of the things I’m going to do is Apple, and companies like Apple, is going to start buiding their product in the United States,” Trump added.\nNorth Carolina was one of several “hard-hit” states regarding net job loss following the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nTrump also had his supporters raise their hands and pledge to vote for him next week in the North Carolina primary on Tuesday. “I swear I’m going to vote for Donald Trump next week,” he had them repeat.\nSome 72 delegates are up for grabs in North Carolina, which is a winner-take-all state.\nTrump is also holding an evening rally on Monday in Madison, Mississippi as Mississippi primary voters head to the polls on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/03/07/3246566/"}
