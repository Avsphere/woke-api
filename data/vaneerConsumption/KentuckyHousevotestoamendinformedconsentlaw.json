(AP) — The Kentucky House has voted to amend the state's informed consent law to allow real-time video consultations between doctors and women at least 24 hours before an abortion.\nThe version passing the House on Thursday evening incorporates telemedicine into the politically charged issue. It offers the option of either face-to-face meetings in person or by video.\nKentucky law has required women to meet with a doctor since 1998 before an abortion.
