Yup, Couples Therapy alumni Stodden and Hutchison are engaged again.\nLast fall, the couple filed for legal separation after three years of marriage. Why? Stodden wanted to, as Real Housewives of Orange County's Vicki Gunvalson would say, whoop it up and be a teen. Back in Nov.,19-year-old Stodden told E! News she and 54-year-old Hutchison split up so that she could \" be free and embrace my independence and not neglect my youth.\" It looked like it that would be the end of Dourtney.\nBUT THAT WOULD NOT BE THE END OF DOURTNEY! They're back on, and they will renew their vows later this year. DOURTNEEEEEEEY RIDES AGAIN.\nMomager Krista Keller told PEOPLE that Stodden dated here and there during the separation, but \"she found out that she really, really loves Doug and he's the one she wants to spend the rest of her life with.\"\nStodden confirmed that she and Hutchison are indeed re-affianced:\nMy joy is so real. Excuse me, rill.","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35544-courtney-stodden-doug-hutchison-to-renew-their-vows-because-dourtney-is-forever"}
