Jesse has proven himself to be an excellent reporter and terrific writer. He spent four months chronicling Quince Orchard High’s run for a state football championship in the memorable “There’s Nothing Like Friday.” These are skills we believe he will put to great use covering the Nationals alongside Chelsea Janes.\nBefore joining The Post, Jesse was the Los Angeles Kings beat writer for the Los Angeles Times, where he interned after graduating from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2018/08/24/jesse-dougherty-moves-to-nationals-beat/"}
