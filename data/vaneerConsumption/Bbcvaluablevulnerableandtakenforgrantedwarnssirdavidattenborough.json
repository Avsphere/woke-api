We have already planted seeds for the future which are ineradicable.\n\"The temperatures are going to increase whatever we do. At the moment the question is whether, in fact, we can keep them down to a level which won't be disastrous.\n\"We are doing what we can but the problem is gigantic.\"\nSpeaking about the prospect of countries co-operating to find a solution, he said: \"Many people say it's an impossible ask. But unless we make some positive concession or some response to that task, we are in for serious trouble.\"\nHe also said that scepticism about climate change was \"bad thinking\".\nHe said: \"If it's so overwhelming, why do people deny it?\n\"The answer is for a lot of people the acceptance of climate change is very difficult for them because it may make a difference to their income or their business.\n\"It may damage their business, it may make them want to try and do things that will cost money, so it's more convenient to say 'no I don't believe it'.\n\"But to anyone who, as it were, doesn't have a vested interest I would have thought that the scientific evidence is beyond doubt.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3422854/BBC-valuable-vulnerable-taken-granted-warns-Sir-David-Attenborough.html"}
