Iris clips are used to treat near sightedness and cataracts.\nCatherine Draycott, Head of Wellcome Images and chair of the judging panel, explained: 'This extreme close-up shows the expertise of the clinical photographer in illustrating with such clarity and precision this minuscule lens that, clipped by a surgeon into the human iris itself, can restore a patient’s vision.'\nOther award-winning images include a beautiful illustration of Nobel laureate and neurobiologist Rita Levi-Montalcini, a glimpse at the intricate system of blood vessels inside an African Grey Parrot and a fascinating visualisation of Twitter conversations about breast cancer.\nThe images will also be displayed in the windows of Wellcome’s HQ in London.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4319700/Wellcome-Trust-announces-winners-2017-Image-Awards.html"}
