OnDeck operates a hybrid model that combines a loan marketplace with lending from its own balance sheet. The new funding will help the firm fund more of its own loans, enabling it to rely less on outside investors — a strategy it has been moving toward for a while. The debt facility will be used to issue loans to its subsidiary PORT II, which will then purchase loans from OnDeck.\nMeanwhile, $125 million of the new facility is committed, and the firm will have access to a further $75 million at Credit Suisse's discretion. This provides it with a much more reliable source of funding for its loans than outside investors.\nHowever, there are some concerns attached to this model. On one hand, it is an efficient way to access capital when many online lenders are under financial pressure. On the other hand, however, this model concentrates risk: By taking loans onto its balance sheet, OnDeck is more likely to suffer as a business if a high proportion of its loans fail. It remains to be seen whether this model's benefits outweigh its risks, but in the meantime, we are likely to see more online lenders pursuing this course.\nSmall businesses represent 99% of US companies, 54% of total sales, and 55% of all jobs, according to the US Small Business Administration.\nThese businesses need capital in order to grow, but small businesses are underfunded — only half of small businesses with $100,000 to $1 million of annual revenue received at least some of the financing they applied for from large banks in late 2015. This is partially because banks have retreated from this segment because issuing loans to small businesses using the traditional underwriting model is expensive. This leaves a massive amount of unfulfilled loans that we estimate reached $96.5 billion in Q4 2015.\nAlternative lending companies have stepped in to capitalize on the opportunity available in helping meet more small business' lending needs.Alternative small business lending platforms use machine learning and digital tools to extend credit to a wide array of small businesses quickly and efficiently, particularly to those that have been rejected by banks. Alternative small business lending companies provide digital platforms that connect small business borrowers to capital using nontraditional means.\nWe estimate that alternative small business lenders originated $5 billion and had a 4.3% share of the small business lending market in the US in 2015. But alternative small business lending platforms will originate $52 billion and gain a 20.7% share of the total market by 2020, driven by the continued growth of new players, increased borrower awareness and interest, and most importantly, major partnerships with big banks.\nBI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on small business alternative lending that analyzes the market opportunity for alternative lenders, forecasts the market share and volume growth of alternative lending platforms, profiles key players, and addresses the main industry risks.\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\nAlternative lending platforms are in a position to capitalize on this underfunding and also take share from banks. These companies use machine learning and digital tools to extend credit to a wide array of small businesses quickly and efficiently. We estimate that alternative lending companies' share of the small business lending market in the US will reach 20.7% by 2020.\nAlternative lenders are now partnering with banks and this will propel growth going forward. New lenders are finding opportunities to offer white-label services to major banks. We expect banking partnerships, like the one between JPMorgan and OnDeck, to add 7.7 percentage points to the alternative lending industry's market share by 2020.\nA flurry of new lenders have entered the market, but it's still early innings. A handful of small business lenders, from Funding Circle to Credibly, have entered the market and this is creating challenges as customer acquisition costs rise and alternative lending companies struggle to differentiate themselves.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ondeck-gets-200-million-from-credit-suisse-2016-12"}
