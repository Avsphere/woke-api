This has been mostly done at Jordan's expense,\" he added.\nThe kingdom has repeatedly said that the influx of refugees is a burden that has strained its already poor resources in water and electricity and urged more help from the international community.\n\"Jordan is willing to cooperate with any country which might be able to take refugees from the border camp,\" said Momani.\n\"Jordan encourages international agencies to provide all the needed support,\" he added.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3394384/16-000-Syrian-refugees-stuck-Jordan-border-minister.html"}
