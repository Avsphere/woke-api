For the safety of residents and drivers, the project will require the entire intersection be closed for a minimum of one day.\nThe intersection at Thrasher Street and Holcomb Bridge Road is just west of the somewhat infamous Norfolk Southern railroad crossing. The railroad crossing made news in 2017 when a tractor-trailer was demolished after becoming stuck on the tracks. The city has been working with county and railroad officials to come up with a plan to improve the intersection.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/busy-norcross-intersection-will-close-nov-for-utility-work/VMlfLekDsTH5cGxWgRf9cJ/"}
