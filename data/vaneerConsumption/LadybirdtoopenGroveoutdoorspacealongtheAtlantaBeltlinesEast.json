Ladybird’s outdoor seating will be more than doubled.\nLadybird Grove and Mess Hall sits on the Eastside Trail of the Beltline in the Old Fourth Ward at mile marker 9.25. (Jenni Girtman/ info@atlantaeventphotography.com)\nFrom the press release:\nExpect patio furniture arranged in clusters with Adirondack chairs and retro metal gliders, as well as a number of communal, beer garden tables. The dog-friendly space will be just inches from the BeltLine, welcoming passersby and serving as a spot to hang out and people-watch. An abundance of bike racks will be available for guests arriving on two wheels. A vintage camper will house the Grove’s outdoor bar, and strands of string lights will illuminate two Ping-Pong tables for nighttime games. Live musical performances will be a regular weekend feature.\nIntended as a natural retreat to enjoy the outdoors, the Grove will serve a separate drinks-only menu, including bottled cocktails. Ladybird’s full food and drinks menu will continue to be offered throughout the rest of the restaurant.\nMore on Ladybird:\nExploring Atlanta's food scene by bike\nReview: Campfire cuisine at Ladybird Grove and Mess Hall\nFirst Look: Ladybird Grove and Mess Hall\nNew spins on Southern breakfast at Ladybird\nBeltline's growth brings crowds, questions\nRead more stories like this by liking Atlanta Restaurant Scene on Facebook and following Atlanta Dining on Twitter.\nRead the AJC Fall Dining Guide, Atlanta Around the Clock, here .","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/atlanta-restaurants/ladybird-open-grove-outdoor-space-along-the-atlanta-beltline-eastside-trail/KhBDMJ6qg2fUvl5VpCsO9L/"}
