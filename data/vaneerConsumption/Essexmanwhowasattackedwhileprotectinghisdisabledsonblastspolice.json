'I had a broken cheekbone, a broken nose and blood clotting. They can't just walk away from that.\n'That is bad. I think they should get sentenced at least. I am going to phone the police to see what is happening because I can't see why they have been let off, that is not right.\n'It just shows these kids that they can get away with it. Especially with everything at the moment that is happening in the town with murders and shootings.\nVicious: Mr Smith was left with a black eye, broken nose, cheekbone fractures and a blood clot on the brain\n'It is not setting a good example for the police force either. They have arrested them and then they waste taxpayers' money letting them go. It is not right and I am not happy about it, that is for sure.'\nHours before the attack on October 26 last year, a gang was seen taunting Lewis outside the family home.\nThe teenager has been the victim of so much bullying that he has been 'scared' to leave the house, his father said. The group sent Lewis an abusive text message and were told to 'clear off'.\nBut 30 minutes later a much larger group returned, covering their faces with hoodies and balaclavas.\nIntimidation: He confronted the 20 hooded thugs outside his home in Great Baddow, Essex, street pictured\nMr Smith was attacked when he went outside to confront the group and was left with serious injuries.\nSpeaking at the time he said: 'One of them headbutted me, and while my head was swimming, I felt the baseball bat.'\nA spokesman for Essex Police said: 'The Essex Police enquiry into this assault is still continuing.\n'An 18-year-old man from Chelmsford remains on bail under investigation and he is due to report back on February 27.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393912/Father-attacked-baseball-bat-20-strong-mob-youths-protecting-13-year-old-disabled-son-blasts-police-failing-bring-gang-justice.html"}
