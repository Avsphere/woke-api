We’re not going to take cheap shots, we’re not going to go attacking other candidates or their campaigns. We’ll just lay out the facts and the facts are pretty clear. … We’ve seen a growing trend, I think, now more than ever, Americans realize this isn’t something that’s just happening over there. I mean, France is a good example. I think that many people look at what happened in France and say that was because the French government for a while was tracking individuals like this…they set that aside. Now you see an overreaction, what some may argue might be an overreaction in terms of the people in France to go even further than the Patriot Act because of what they saw there. We need to have a responsible way that is legal and constitutional, but a way that we can make sure that if someone is an enemy combatant, or aligned with an enemy combatant, the United States and the people of this great country, we’ve got to have the tools we need to prevent another act from happening.”\nHe added that there’s a balance and “a way to put in place appropriate checks and balances, to ensure we protect the very civil liberties that American men and women have fought for for so long in our military, but do so in a way that doesn’t just concede our ability to track enemy combatants and those that would seek to do harm.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/05/28/walker-i-disagree-with-rand-on-nsa-isis/"}
