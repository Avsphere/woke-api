Because there are limits on how many pairs one person can buy, it took two members of Citi's social media team, plus one member's parents, to collect the 14 pairs. They've now been distributed to Citi's five regions around the world.\nThe first video debuted last week, with Marilyn McDonald, Citi's head of digital product management, showcasing a day in her life. While Citi does not have a Snapchat account, the videos will be downloaded and posted on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Glassdoor.\nHollis Johnson \"A lot of folks who are interested in technology or technology-type opportunities post-graduation aren't necessarily thinking about financial services,\" Storz said. \"If you could spend some time following a tech analyst who is working in the cybersecurity division, which is very fascinating, you might think very differently about your prospects at Citi.\"\nBanks across Wall Street have had a tougher time recruiting top young talent in the years since the financial crisis. They've found increasingly creative ways to rebrand in an effort to become desirable workplaces for bright college graduates. Citi, for example, announced in March that some junior staff will have the opportunity to take a year off and do charitable work while still earning 60% of their pay.\n\"Over the course of the past several hiring cycles and really coming out of the financial crisis, there are so many different opportunities for bright students right now,\" Storz said. \"There's a much broader landscape and playing field today than, obviously, there was several years ago.\"\nShe said she's noticed an uptick in interest among college grads in the past year or so, however.\nWhile Citi is the first bulge bracket bank to use Spectacles for recruiting, it is certainly not the first to turn to Snapchat as a means of getting closer to millennials.\nGoldman Sachs and JPMorgan have both launched advertising and campus recruiting campaigns using the social media platform.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-using-snap-spectacles-for-recruiting-2016-12"}
