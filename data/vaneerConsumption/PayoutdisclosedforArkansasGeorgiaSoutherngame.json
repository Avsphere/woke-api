The financial guarantee was obtained via a public records request by the Savannah (Ga.) Morning News.\nThe University of Arkansas provided a copy of the game contract to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via a public records request on March 7, but the payment was redacted by university officials, citing a \"competitive advantage exemption\" for not disclosing it.\nThe Razorbacks and Golden Eagles have never played in football. The venue for the game, per the contract, will either be in Fayetteville or Little Rock. The game officials will be assigned by the SEC.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/apr/11/payout-disclosed-arkansas-georgia-southern-game/?page=1"}
