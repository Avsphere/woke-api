The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nAuthorities are looking into whether marijuana or alcohol played a role in the case of a Montana homeowner accused of setting a trap and killing a German exchange student in his garage.\nA newly published court document reveals Missoula police received a judge's permission to test whether homeowner Markus Kaarma was drunk or high when he shot and killed 17-year-old Diren Dede.\nOfficers found a jar of pot in Kaarma's home the day he shot the teen, a police statement accompanying an April 28 request for a search warrant said. Kaarma also might have had marijuana stolen from his garage in a previous burglary, the document said.\nPolice believe Kaarma \"may have been impaired by alcohol, dangerous drugs, other drugs, intoxicating substances or a combination of the above, at the time of the incident,\" the statement from Detective Dean Chrestenson said.\nDistrict Judge Karen Townsend granted the warrant to draw Kaarma's blood to test whether any traces of intoxicants remained.\nThe results likely won't be released publicly while the investigation into Dede's death is ongoing.\nKaarma's attorney, Paul Ryan, did not immediately return calls for comment in response to the allegations. In a statement to the media, Ryan said Dede and a companion had broken into garages at least three of four times before the April 27 shooting, and the neighborhood was on alert after a series of burglaries.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pot-may-be-factor-montana-exchange-student-killing-police-n98711"}
