That was it. It was that Us Weekly cover [which revealed Dean had cheated]... Then when it came out, I didn't know what to do. This wasn't going away.\nProbing: Lena Dunham (seen here last month) interviewed the star for her Lenny newsletter\nWhile horrified people knew, she felt she had to face the scandal head on and, in Tori's world, that meant a reality show - True Tori.\n'Everyone said, ''This happens all the time. Look at all the A-list celebrities. They used to complain about it. Then they go on and do a big movie and it just goes away.'' That's not my life. That's not my relationship with my fans. I'm not the type that can just go from talking about everything and then it's like, ''No personal questions,'' the next time I do something.\n'It was honestly my decision [to do the reality show]. This was affecting me on many levels, not just the personal level. This is my career; this is, I hate saying it, my brand. All the lines blurred at that point.\n'I obviously ran it by Dean, and if he had been adamant that he didn't want to do it, I would not have done it. I would have respected that. He just said, ''Do what you have to do.''\n'He was at that point where he just was at the lowest point. He was in rehab, and he was just like, ''I f**ked up. I'll do whatever I have to do to maintain our relationship.'''\nWhile the former child star seems to have worked through the hurt and pained caused he his affair, the star does carry a deep scar thanks to a relationship truth revealed when they first started doing reality television together.\nShe told Lena: 'On Tori and Dean, I was the executive producer. I looked at every edit. I basically protected our relationship through that. At first, it was fine, but it was a new relationship for us. We started the show when I was pregnant with Liam, when we had just gotten married.\n'We had this thing that was fairy tale, amazing, newlywed period, honeymoon, unbelievable. All of a sudden, we got pregnant, and then I saw a different side of him. Not that I didn't love him. But I thought, I didn't sign up for this. [I said] ''Wait, you didn't show me this.'' He said, ''If I had shown you that side, you wouldn't have been with me.'' That's not fair. It's like, 'Can I go back and sue you now?'\nDid it her way: While horrified people knew, the actress (pictured last week) felt she had to face the scandal head on and, in Tori's world, that meant a reality show - True Tori\n'But the show was happening. The reality show was a form of acting. I was always watching the scene as it was filming. I was controlling it as best I could.\n'I was being real, but I knew not to let it go to a certain place. I knew Dean had a temper, and I didn't want that on camera, because that didn't serve us well. We were like America's sweetheart couple.\n'It seemed like I was giving them enough that it was real, but I wasn't telling all the details that they'd be like, ''We're really disappointed in this relationship.''\nStruggling in a relationship is not something new for Tori, who also spoke about her strained relationship with her mother Candy Spelling, which continues to make headlines today.\nTough time: Dean struggled but agreed to do the reality show, Tori said, 'He was at that point where he just was at the lowest point. He was in rehab, and he was just like, ''I f**ked up. I'll do whatever I have to do to maintain our relationship'\nCover up: Prior to True Tori and the affair, the actress said she had done her best to keep up their image if 'America's Sweethearts'\nEarlier this month after it was revealed Tori was being sued by American Express for unpaid credit card balances, her mom slammed her publicly.\nGrowing up their relationship was so difficult, Tori said she never got a chance to feel her mother's touch.\nAccording to Tori even as a child she often asked her father Aaron - who produced Tori's Beverly Hills 90210 - why her mother treated her the way she did and he said that was the way Candy's mother had been too.\nNot easy: The 90210 star's relationship with her mother Candy Spelling (pictured 2011) is notriously strained and growing up their relationship was so difficult, Tori said she never got a chance to feel her mother's touch\n'When I found out I was pregnant with a daughter, I thought, ''F**k. I am screwed.'' I cried when I found out I was carrying a daughter. I didn't know what to do. I thought, I'm going to repeat the past. This is just the way it goes.\n'[But] I'd think, ''What would make me different? What's my instinct of what would make that different?'' My instinct was touch. I just wanted to hug her and hold her and tell her how beautiful she was and make eye contact.'\nThe star said Stella, 7, and her have a very close relationship but currently her four-year, Hattie, tells her she hates her every day, so she hopes the cycle is not repeating.\nOops! Tor's oldest daughter Stella found out about the star's breast implants through the reality show\nTori confesses she does not always get it right as a mom, with her daughter once finding out too much because of their reality show, namely that the actress' breasts were not real - which the star said was like finding out about 'was like Santa Claus'.\n'Her world was just shattered. It hit me hard, and I felt so guilty.'\nWhile her life has been all about being in the public eye, Tori said her hopes for hers and her family's future is walking away from being the star.\n'I don't have that opportunity right now yet to create a show and not have myself in it, because that's what sells currently. [But] I want to get to the next level where I'm not in it. I don't want to be out there talking about my life and showing my life.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3423199/Tori-Spelling-speaks-husband-Dean-McDermott-s-affair-not-wanting-mom-revealing-fake-breasts-daughter.html"}
