I’ve never seen anything like this. Politicians are supposed to make promises they are not going to keep,” Coulter added.\nTrump, she said, was not that kind of candidate.\nInstead of making promises he won’t be able to keep, Coulter said, Trump simply says exactly what he will do if elected president: build a wall and limit illegal immigration.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/02/03/exclusive-ann-coulter-says-democrat-obama-administration-will-not-indict-hillary-clinton/"}
