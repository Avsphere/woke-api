His father was thrilled and name him Kang Kang, meaning 'healthy'\nKang Kang was born through a Caesarean Section on March 6 in the Daxing Hospital in Xi'an, China's Shaanxi Province, according to People's Daily Online, citing a report from Huashang Daily.\nHe was born in good health and measured 22.8 inches (58cm) long, nearly twice the length of an average baby.\nMr Wang said that his wife, 35, was a little 'chubby' and that she had suffered from gestational diabetes.\nAs a result of the diabetes, the woman suffered from eating disorders, according to a video report by Xinhua News Agency.\nHowever, his father told a reporter from Huashang Daily that his wife's diet had comprised mainly coarse food grain during her pregnancy.\nHe said that his son must have been 'too good at absorbing nutrients in his mother's belly', hence being so heavy.\nCHINA'S BIG ISSUE: OBESITY IS ON THE RISE Prevalence of childhood overweight rose from 1.11 per cent to 9.62 per cent between 1985 and 2010.\nOverweight and obesity were found to be most common among boys living in urban regions (23.2 per cent).\nWorld Obesity Federation expects China to have the most obese children in the world in 2025.\nThe number of obese children aged between five and 18 will reach 48 million in a decade. Source: WHO, CCTV News\nApparently before Kang Kang was born, Mr Wang and Mrs Wang had been told that their baby could be large, but they were surprised to learn that he weighed in at 14.8 pounds (6.7kg).\nAfter Mr Wang shared pictures of his baby on his social media account, his relatives were said to be envious of his 'big son'.\nThe couple already have an eight-year-old daughter.\nShe was also heavy at birth, weighing 11 pounds (5kg). The father said his daughter exercises regularly and her weight is normal now.\nShe advised Mr and Mrs Wang to manage Kang Kang's diet and to keep a close look at his weight - so that the child wouldn't suffer from illnesses, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.\nThe doctor also said many Chinese families prefer to have bigger babies, so they would overfeed expectant mothers.\nHowever, Dr Liu warned against the tradition as excessive nutrients could lead to illnesses in the baby; it could also increase the difficulties of the mother's labour.\nIn China, a baby is categorised as 'overweight' if he or she weighs more than 8.8 pounds (4kg) within an hour of birth.\nA newborn Chinese boy weighs 3.32kg on average while a newborn Chinese girl weighs 3.21kg, according to the country's Ministry of Health.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-4301182/Giant-baby-boy-weighing-14-7-pounds-born-China.html"}
