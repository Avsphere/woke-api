According to TMZ, the previously unnamed friend that Jon Koppenhaver allegedly attacked along with Christy Mack is reality star Corey Thomas, best remembered for a short stint on the 2009 VH1 series Megan Wants a Millionaire.\nIf you're not familiar with the story, word of warning: It's a difficult one to hear about. Koppenhaver, who is a professional mixed martial arts fighter known by the stage name \"War Machine,\" is accused of showing up at Mack's home last week when Thomas was present, and, in Mack's own words, \"...he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face.\" Mack bravely shared her story, along with photos of her recovering in the hospital after the alleged attack, with The Huffington Post .\nThomas' name had not surfaced until now — TMZ broke the news, and pointed out that Megan Wants a Millionaire is the same show that received its own share of media attention in the past when Thomas' co-star, Ryan Jenkins, killed his wife and, subsequently, himself. Thomas is said to be suffering from \"a broken nose and 2 black eyes,\" while Mack is still in the hospital recovering from her extensive injuries due to the alleged attack as well.\nAs for Koppenhaver — there are about 7 warrants out for his arrest, so we can only hope it's a matter of time before he's caught in connection with his alleged involvement.\nHere's a clip of Thomas back when he was in Megan Wants a Millionaire:\nImage: Christy Mack/Facebook","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35760-christy-macks-friend-who-was-also-allegedly-assaulted-is-identified-as-a-former-reality-star"}
