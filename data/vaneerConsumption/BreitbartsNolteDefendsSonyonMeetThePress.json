I don’t think it is a good precedent if you are threatened by a foreign government to squander an $80 million investment on Google or on You Tube. People saying they should have streamed it. There is still a win that can be pulled out of this. The government needs to come in and make it as safe for Hollywood to make movies about North Korea as it is for the airlines to fly planes in the face of al Qaeda. Once the structures are put in place and the safeguards are put in place, some shield from liability, then, let’s release the movie. We can all say nanny-nanny-boo-boo to North Korea, make $100 million and that’s a win.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/12/21/breitbarts-nolte-defends-sony-on-meet-the-press/"}
