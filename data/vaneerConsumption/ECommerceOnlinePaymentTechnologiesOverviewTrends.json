Furthermore, BI Intelligence expects that number to rise to $632 billion in 2020.\nThis is unsurprising considering e-commerce's healthy growth. While the U.S. retail average growth rate in the first half of 2016 was just 2% for total retail, it was 16% for e-commerce.\nThe number of online shoppers has grown by nearly 20 million from 2015 to 2016. And these 224 million shoppers are spending more, as the total amount spent online grew from $61 billion in the first quarter of 2015 to $68 billion in Q1 2016. Finally, these customers are transacting more frequently, as the number of online transactions has risen by 115 million from 2015 to 2016.\nBII\nOnline Payment Trends\nThe shift to digital has begun, and three segments are leading the way in that regard: media, sporting goods, and hobbies. More than half of these total sales will occur online in 2016.\nElectronics, meanwhile, has remained steady since 2011, and nearly one in four electronics purchases have been made online each year since 2014. Best Buy has capitalized on this trend by beefing up its e-commerce efforts in the fourth quarter (aka holiday season). But Amazon is starting to challenge Best Buy's dominance, and has been expanding its market share since 2013.\nDespite logistical barriers, consumers are also showing a growing interest in buying furniture online, as online furniture sales are quickly closing in on 25% of the total furniture sale market. In response to this trend, Wayfair launched an app called Wayfairview that lets shoppers see how furniture would look in their homes. As a result, sales have more than doubled in two years.\nApparel and accessories, however, have been slower to embrace the digital. And yet, 25% of purchases occur online, which accounts for nearly $80 billion in sales.\nFinally, e-commerce will account for 8% of all health and personal care items sold in 2016.\nMore to Learn\nTrends indicate that e-commerce is the wave of the future for shoppers. But digital shopping is just one piece of the broader payments ecosystem.\nThat's why BI Intelligence spent months compiling the best and most exhaustive guide on the world of payments entitled The Payments Ecosystem Report: Everything You Need to Know About The Next Era of Payment Processing.\nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide to the payments industry, choose one of these options:\nSubscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT\nThe choice is yours.
