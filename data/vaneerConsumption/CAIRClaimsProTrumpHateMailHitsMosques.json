Statement from #CAIR: https://t.co/ASSQFLhLVg pic.twitter.com/ZMwhifn9Yt — Zahra Billoo (@ZahraBilloo) November 26, 2016\nCAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in a Hamas terror-funding operation.\n“You Muslims are vile and filthy people,” the letter’s author wrote. It went on to say “there’s a new sheriff in town,” referring to Trump, and suggested that he is “going to cleanse America and make it shine again” by doing “to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews.”\nThe handwriting on the letter looks elementary.\nAccording to a CAIR-LA press release, the letter was sent to the Islamic Center of Long Beach, the Islamic Center of Claremont and an Islamic center in San Jose, prompting CAIR’s San Francisco Bay Area chapter to call for similar police protection of mosques, notes local ABC affiliate in Los Angeles ABC 7.\n“We are not going to be alarmist. It is just one letter,” Hasan Z. Rahim, a spokesman for the Evergreen Islamic Center told the San Jose Mercury News. “But we also are going to have to be vigilant.”\nRahim added that the center has received anti-Muslim phone calls following waves of terrorist attacks, carried out by Muslims. However, this was its first time receiving a letter, he told the paper.\nAccording to the Mercury News, while Rahim said he found the letter addressed to the three mosques disturbing, he does not believe it would result in physical violence against the center.\n“All of us are Americans,” Rahim reportedly said. “We are as much a part of this land as anyone else. And we are confident that this being a country of law, no one really can take the law into their own hands and act on their own bigotry.”\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2016/11/27/children-of-satan-cair-claims-pro-trump-hate-mail-sent-to-socal-mosques/"}
