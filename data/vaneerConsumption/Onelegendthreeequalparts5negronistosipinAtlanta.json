The Count must have been having a rough day. Instead of topping his cocktail with fizzy water, he requested something a little stronger. Gin. The equal parts, stirred classic of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth with a twist of orange was born.\nWhatever the story is behind this fortuitous afternoon at Caffè Casoni, the Negroni has since become a favorite of bartenders to sip and riff on and coveted by the nerdy cocktail set. You’ve likely had a couple of the Negroni’s more popular variations such as the bourbon-based Boulevardier or an Old Pal with rye whiskey. Easy to make, easy to riff, easy to sip, here are five Negronis in Atlanta worth your while.\nEleanor’s at Muss & Turner’s\nSlip behind the cooler door and follow the dark passageway to Eleanor’s speakeasy. While there’s a list of classic cocktails and any number of brown spirits to choose from, we suggest ordering a Mezcal Negroni. The bar gets crafty pairing light and smoky mezcal with the bracing bittersweetness of St. George Bruto Americano (amaro). The result is a well-balanced and bold beauty where neither spirit is lost to the other.\n1675 Cumberland Pkwy SE #309, Smyrna. 770-434-1114, mussandturners.com/eleanors.\nEleanor's in Smyrna gets crafty with the Negroni pairing light and smoky mezcal with the bracing bittersweetness of St. George Bruto Americano (amaro).

Beverage director and Bombay Sapphire finalist for “Most Imaginative Bartender” Trip Sandifer doesn’t mess with this cocktail’s success. He leaves the freestyling to you and your bowling skills. Did we mention it’s only $8?\n737 Miami Circle NE, Atlanta. 404-814-8736, thepaintedpin.com.\nGrain\nWhile the Italian Job from Grain is more of a riff on an Americano, the 1860s classic aperitivo is said to have inspired the creation of the Negroni. Remember turning soda water into gin? But rather than give you the straightforward cocktail of Campari, sweet vermouth and soda, the bar takes cues from Count Negroni himself and swaps fizzy water for the effervescent Stiegl-Radler (grapefruit juice and Goldbräu lager). It’s crisp, citrusy and 100% refreshing on a hot day.\n856 West Peachtree St. NW, Atlanta. 404-881-5377, grain-bar.com.\nPoor Hendrix\nThis East Lake bar keeps the classic local using Atlanta's Old 4th Distillery gin to pair with Campari and sweet vermouth. The gin likens itself to a traditional London dry but uses a sugarcane base giving the spirit a soft, floral touch. This is a smooth Negroni with hints of bitterness.\n2371 Hosea L Williams Drive SE, Atlanta. 404-549-8756, poorhendrix.com.\nThe Pinewood\nThey say everything gets better with age. It’s true because a barrel-aged Negroni is a gorgeous thing. Resting in oak mellows this cocktail out and transforms it into a smooth, luscious libation. The Pinewood fine tunes the classic combining gin and Campari with the richness of Cocchi Torino vermouth and the mint notes of the herbaceous Alpine Amaro Braulio (also aged in oak.) The intense combination settles as it rests but retains a robust flavor with hints of oak from the barrel. A Negroni even a hardcore whiskey drinker will love.\n254 W.
