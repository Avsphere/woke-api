He'll also work to boost time off for paternity leave and adoptions.\nThe proposal is part of Carter's ongoing effort to modernize the military and make it more competitive in recruiting. He's already pushed past Marine Corps objections to letting women apply for combat jobs and has expressed openness to letting transgender people serve openly.\nThe officials say Carter intends to expand health care coverage to include more benefits for women trying to get pregnant. And he will expand the hours and capacity of child care facilities.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421398/Defense-chief-seek-longer-family-leave.html"}
