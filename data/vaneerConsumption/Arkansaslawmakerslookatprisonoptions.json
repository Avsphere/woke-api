State prison officials are expected to ask lawmakers to approve their plans for their new facility, which they've said may be funded by increasing the decal fee on car tags.\nThe report suggests the state look at using a private corrections management company to handle some inmates, and also says the state could consider using abandoned school buildings and other available structures rather than new construction.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/nov/24/arkansas-lawmakers-look-prison-options/"}
