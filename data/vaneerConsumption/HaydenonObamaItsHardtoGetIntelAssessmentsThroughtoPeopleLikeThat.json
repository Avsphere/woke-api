U.S. Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, the former director of the CIA and NSA, told Fox News Radio host Brian Kilmeade that because President Barack Obama preferred to read his intelligence briefings instead of engaging with officials and asking questions like former President George W. Bush, it was not easy to get the assessments across to the current commander-in-chief.\nHayden said, “People like me have to accommodate to people like that,” adding “my old job is easier when you are face to face,” but he said, “President Obama absorbs information by reading and reflecting.”\n“It was easier for the intel briefer,” “when the individual engages,” Hayden explained.\nHayden said, “It is pretty clear in this case” we are dealing with “the phenomenon of the unpleasant fact.”\nHe explained that in Obama’s case “you’re there briefing a position, a flow, a thread, a development that is absolutely cutting across the grain of the world as the policymaker would like it to be, or he perceives it to be,” he added “you’re in essence telling this individual the world isn’t as he believed it to be, and I think we had an awful lot of that going on.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/09/04/hayden-on-obama-its-hard-to-get-intel-assessments-through-to-people-like-that/"}
