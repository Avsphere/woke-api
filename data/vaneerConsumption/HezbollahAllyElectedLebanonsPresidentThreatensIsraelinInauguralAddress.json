His election ended a two-year political standoff in the country, during which the presidency remained vacant. The turning point came when former Prime Minister Sa’ad Hariri, leader of the mainly Sunni Future Movement, agreed to support Aoun, apparently in return for being re-appointed prime minister.\nHariri’s reversal is dramatic. In a New York Times op-ed published last month, the politician demanded that Iran stop meddling in the internal affairs of Arab countries and destabilizing the Middle East. He also accused Hezbollah of turning “its weapons against the Lebanese people.” Hariri father was assassinated in 2005, a crime widely thought to have been committed by Hezbollah. Four Hezbollah operatives have been charged in absentia for their role in the killing by a United Nations court in The Hague.\nIn his introductory speech to parliament, Aoun said that his government would “not spare any efforts to protect Lebanon from Israel and liberate the remainder of our lands; we will address terrorism in a preemptive manner.”\nIsrael completed its withdrawal from Lebanese territory, which it occupied after the 1982 Lebanon War, in May 2000.
