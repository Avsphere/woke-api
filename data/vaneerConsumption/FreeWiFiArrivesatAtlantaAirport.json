The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nTravelers, after years of complaints, will have access to a free wireless Internet network at the world's busiest airport.\nOfficials say the network at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport cost more than $5.2 million to install.\nAtlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and the airport's general manager on Wednesday announced the launch of the free Wi-Fi in the 6.8 million square-foot terminal complex. Officials say workers spent less than 30 days assembling the network. It's expected to accommodate up to 15,000 simultaneous users.\nSouthwell says the airport's lack of a free Wi-Fi network put the facility at a competitive disadvantage, and was the No. 1 customer complaint. Customers previously had to pay $4.95 to get online.\nAirport officials say the airport serves more than 94 million passengers annually.\nâ€” The Associated Press","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/free-wi-fi-arrives-atlanta-airport-n123046"}
