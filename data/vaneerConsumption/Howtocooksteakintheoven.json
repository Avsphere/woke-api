We’ve got the recipe for you. All you need is a great steak, a large cast-iron skillet, and some kitchen tongs. Any thick cut of steak can be pan-roasted—rib eye, filet mignon, T-bone, strip steak are all great cuts for this method. (Save thinner cuts like skirt or flank steak for the grill.)\n1. Start with room temperature steak\nCold meat will immediately seize up in a hot pan, so it’s best to let the steak come to room temperature before you put it in a hot pan. Let it rest on the kitchen counter for about 30 minutes. While the steak rests, preheat the oven to 400? and place the cast-iron skillet inside the oven so it can heat up as the oven preheats.\n2. Season it well\nRub both sides of the steak with a little olive oil, then generously season it all oven with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.\n3. Transfer the skillet\nCarefully remove the hot skillet from the oven (oven mitts, please!) and place it on the stovetop to a burner set to medium-high heat.\n4. Sear the steak\nUsing tongs, place the seasoned steak in the hot pan and let it sizzle and sear for about 1 minute. Flip the steak over and sear the other side for 1 minute.\n5. Cook the steak\nCarefully transfer the seared steak in the skillet to the preheated oven (remember: hot pan!). Cook, turning the steak halfway through the cooking time, about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on how thick the steak is and your desired degree of doneness.\n6. Let it rest\nAlways let cooked meat rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing it against the grain.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/food--cooking/how-cook-steak-the-oven/wBCapXdJulZwEhUmVbXwdK/"}
