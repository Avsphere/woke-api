-\nTrump's revised ban signed on March 6 had a reduced scope, exempting Iraqis, permanent US residents and valid visa holders -- an effort by the administration to ensure the order passed legal muster.\nThe White House said the other six countries were targeted because their screening and information capabilities could not meet US security requirements.\nIn Hawaii, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, defending the government's position, said: \"This order doesn't draw any religious distinction at all.\"\nWashington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson address the media following a hearing about US President Donald Trump's travel ban at the US District Court in Seattle, Washington on March 15, 2017\nQuestioned about Trump's tweets and statements during the campaign in which he promised to enact a \"Muslim ban,\" Wall said: \"There is a difference between a president and a candidate.\"\nBut District Judge Derrick Watson rejected the idea that the order was not a Muslim ban, ruling it was plausible \"to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam,\" given their Muslim populations all topped 90 percent.\nThe judge said \"a reasonable, objective observer... would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously-neutral purpose.\"\nHe referred to several examples of Trump explicitly framing proposed action on immigration in religious tones, including a March 2016 interview during which the then president-elect said: \"I think Islam hates us.\"\nWatson indicated that the court would not stay its decision in the event of an appeal.\nIn Maryland, US District Judge Theodore Chuang echoed Watson's argument, as he issued a partial injunction on a separate complaint filed by advocacy groups claiming that the amended order discriminates against Muslims.\n- Three strikes and you're out? -\nTrump, addressing supporters late Wednesday in Nashville, assailed the Hawaii judge.\nDemonstrators gather near the White House to protest President Donald Trump's travel ban on six Muslim countries on March 11, 2017\n\"The law in the Constitution gave the president the power to suspend immigration when he deems it to be in the national interest of our country,\" he said.\n\"We are going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court. We are going to win.\"\nThe Justice Department called the Hawaii ruling \"flawed both in reasoning and in scope.\"\nThe Hawaii and Maryland rulings came after a trio of hearings Wednesday on the ban.\nIn Seattle, Washington state's attorney general filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order that would last up to 14 days in order to halt the travel restrictions, also citing \"irreparable injuries.\"\nRights groups and states contesting the ban welcomed the rulings.\n\"The Constitution has once again put the brakes on President Trump's disgraceful and discriminatory ban,\" said Omar Jadwat, director of the immigrant rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has joined the case in Washington state, said: \"Today's order by the federal District Court of Hawaii marks yet another victory for the Constitution and the rule of law.\"\nCornell University Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr warned Trump against a protracted battle.\n\"President Trump and his advisors should think long and hard before trying to impose a travel ban a third time. They may strike out,\" he said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4320736/Trump-ready-fight-travel-ban-blocked.html"}
