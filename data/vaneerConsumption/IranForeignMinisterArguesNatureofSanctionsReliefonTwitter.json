There is no need to spin using “fact sheets” so early on. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2015\nThat was apparently a reference to this fact sheet summarizing the deal, which was posted on the State Department’s website. About 30 minutes later, Zarif reacted even more strongly to claims that Iran would receive “gradual” sanctions relief.\nIran/5+1 Statement: “US will cease the application of ALL nuclear-related secondary economic and financial sanctions.” Is this gradual? — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2015\nIran/P5+1 Statement: “The EU will TERMINATE the implementation of ALL nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions”. How about this? — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2015\nThat phrase “gradual” did not appear in the State Department fact sheet, so it’s not clear what it was that prompted Zarif’s outburst.\nPresident Obama did say something similar to “gradual” during his Rose Garden announcement of the framework. Describing the lifting of sanctions in response to Iranian compliance with the terms of the deal, Obama said, [emphasis added] “In return for Iran’s actions, the international community has agreed to provide Iran with relief from certain sanctions… This relief will be phased as Iran takes steps to adhere to the deal.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/04/02/iran-foreign-minister-argues-nature-of-sanctions-relief-on-twitter/"}
