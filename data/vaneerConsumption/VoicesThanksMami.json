Reflecting on the journey I have taken to get here, the first person that comes to mind is my mom, who has pushed me and supported me more than anyone else.\nI should start by saying that Mami, who was raised in a tight-knit Cuban household, is as “old-school” as it gets and never really approved of my going away for college. No one in my family had ever taken that \"risk,\" and here I was packing my bags and leaving my home in Florida to finish my college career more than 1,000 miles away.\nThe first month was brutal. I would get calls six times a day for an update that I was still alive and doing well. “Mijita, ya comistes?” (\"did you eat?\") was, and still is, the most frequently asked question. Every day I’d give my mother a play-by-play of my day and what my schedule looked like for the rest of the week.\nTo my mom, I was strong and determined to make it. But when she was asleep I would call my sister, homesick, so my mom would not think I was backing out of my decision to leave home.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/voices-thanks-mami-n100756"}
