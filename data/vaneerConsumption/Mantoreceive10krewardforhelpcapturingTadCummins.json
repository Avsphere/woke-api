Jason Whatley.\nScroll down for video\nGriffin Barry, 29 (pictured), helped police arrest Tad Cummins, the 50-year-old Tennessee teacher who had been on the run for more than a month with one of his 15-year-old students\nCummins' former co-worker Chandler Anderson offered up a $10,000 reward to anyone who could bring Thomas home safely.\nWhen news broke that the teacher was taken into custody, Anderson - a nurse practitioner who worked with Cummins while he was a respiratory therapist - was flooded with text messages.\nAnderson told WVLT, 'That's a good way to wake up,' before adding: 'We are thrilled to write this check.'\nAnderson is even offering Barry a paid trip to Tennessee to properly thank the 29-year-old cabin caretaker for his help.\nBarry didn't realize Tad Cummins (left) was on the run with his student Elizabeth Thomas (right) until a neighbor showed him a picture of the girl's missing person poster. He then called 911\nCummins continued to drive his Nissan Rogue the whole time, but removed the license plates\nLooking back, Barry said there was something suspicious about the couple.\n'She spoke very few words and he would try and like, talk for her a lot,' Barry told KRCR. 'He was likely clearly keeping her separate.'\nBarry says the two first came through the area two weeks ago, looking for the Black Bear Ranch Commune in Siskiyou County, California.\nThe couple, claiming to be 38 and 24 years old, had run out of gas and Cummins told a sad story about how they lost all of their possessions in a house fire in Colorado and didn't have any money left.\nSo Barry decided to be a Good Samaritan, and gave Cummins money, gas and directions to the commune.\n'I put some gas in his car and gave him $40 dollars and said if it doesn’t work come back I’ll feed you, you know what I mean?' Barry, 29, told WKRN.\nCummins and Thomas did in fact make it to the commune, but the members there sensed something was off and decided against letting them into the group.\nThe pair were found in one of these cabins in a remote section of northern California after a neighbor showed the shack's caretaker a picture of the girl's missing person poster\nBarry let the two stay in an unfinished cabin near Cecilville, California, in exchange for work after the 50-year-old fabricated a story claiming he lost everything he owned in a fire\nLooking back, Barry said there was something suspicious about the couple\n'I feel a little funny because there were all kinds of indications that there was something a little funny going on [but it] never occurred to me that she was 15 years old. They said she was 22, I thought…yeah,' member Peter LaughingWolf said.\nLaughingWolf said that after telling Cummins that they wouldn't be a good fit, he stormed off with Thomas.\n'What really should have been a clue that something was wrong was that he got so angry when that was shared with them,' added LaughingWolf.\nAfter they were rejected from the commune, Cummins and Thomas returned to Cecilville on Tuesday, and Barry offered to let them sleep in one of his unfinished cabins in exchange for work.\n'In my head I'm thinking he had a house fire and lost everything,' Barry said. 'I came out here on a prayer and people helped me out and got me on my feet and hopefully I can pass it on.'\nThe pair fled 2,500 miles over the course of their journey, cops said. Police said they didn't know if Thomas was willing to go with Cummins, but that it didn't matter, legally\nBarry, right, appeared on Good Morning America Friday morning to detail how he helped police nab Cummins\nThomas' family appeared on Good Morning America on Friday, saying they had not yet been able to talk to her. Pictured bottom left is Elizabeth's father Anthony\nTHE PAIR'S FLIGHT FROM JUSTICE January 23: Tad Cummins is spotted kissing Elizabeth Thomas, his student at Culleoka High School, by another student. He denies the claim, saying that they are friends; she is taken out of his classes February 3: Cummins is reprimanded by the school principal after Elizabeth is found to have entered his classroom for around 30 minues February 6: Cummins is suspended c. March 9: He takes out a $4,500 loan on his car March 12: Cummins buys hair dye from Walmart in Columbia, TN March 13, 7:45am: Thomas is dropped off at Shoney's in Columbia by a friend March 13, 8am: Cummins is seen pumping gas in Columbia March 13, noon: Cummins and Elizabeth are seen together in Decatur, AL, around 70 miles from Columbia. He is fired from his job this same day March 15: Cummins and Thomas are seen buying food at a Walmart. They are sporting dyed hair. This is their last sighting for more than a month March 30: Tad Cummins' wife of 31 years, Jill, files for divorce April 19: The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) is contacted by caretaker Griffin Barry, who says the paid is staying on his property in Cecilville, California April 20: Police converge on the remote cabin, arrest Cummins and confirm that Elizabeth is safe\nBarry said he rarely interacted with Thomas during the couple's 36-hour stay at the property.\n'He would talk for her a lot and kept her separate, you know,' Barry told WBIR. 'And a couple of times he always kept her in the car and he would be like 'she's asleep,' you know, and I'm like okay. I was kind of telling some people, you know, she never really looks at me and he's always talking for her. I was like, whatever, they're on hard times or something.'\nIt wasn't until Wednesday night that he finally recognized Cummins and the girl, when a neighbor showed him a missing persons picture.\n'Someone was showing me a picture, I was telling them you know and said \"That's the guy,\"' he said. 'So we called 911 last night and we were calling that Tennessee Bureau of Investigation line or whatever so I guess the first sheriff got out here at about 2am.'\nThe neighbor reportedly got suspicious about the couple's car, a silver Nissan Rogue. It was the same car the couple went missing in, and the plates had been removed.\nAfter using the car's vehicle identification number to confirm it belonged to the ex-teacher, SWAT teams formed a perimeter around the cabin and waited for Cummins to walk out around 4am.\nAfter a while, they brought in Barry to help speed up the process.\n'I was driving by trying to flush him out. [Sheriff's deputies] were like, \"honk the horn!\"' Barry said. 'I'm glad I got to help.'\nAs Cummins was taken into custody, he reportedly remarked 'I'm glad this is over'.\nThomas was 'healthy' and 'unharmed' according to police, and had a mixed emotional reaction.\n'It was an intense situation,' Lt Behr Tharsing, of the Siskiyou County Police, told Good Morning America on Friday. 'She was laughing, she was crying, she was kind of an emotional rollercoaster as you can imagine.'\nTwo loaded handguns were found in the cabin.\nThe pair's last sighting before the arrest was at an Oklahoma Walmart on March 15 (pictured). They had died their hair to help evade capture\nWhately, the attorney representing the Thomas family, believes that the pair had intended to keep driving northwest. Maps were found in Cummins' car for both San Francisco and Baltimore.\nThomas is being treated in a mental health facility. Her father, Anthony, told Good Morning America on Friday that the family still hasn't been able to speak to Elizabeth yet and that he believes she may have been brainwashed.\nCummins, who is in a California jail waiting to be transferred back to Tennessee, is charged with one federal count of transportation of a minor across state lines for the purpose of criminal sexual intercourse.\nHe also faces state charges of sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. The aggravated kidnapping charge carries an eight to 12 year sentence.\nA criminal complaint released Friday also revealed new details about Cummins.\nIt says that before leaving town, he refilled his Cialis prescription - a drug that treats erectile dysfunction. He also picked up KY Jelly, a personal lubricant, during a stop at Walmart in Oklahoma with Thomas.\nCummins, 50, who is married and has two daughters and grandchildren, allegedly abducted his former student on March 13 from her home near Columbia, Tennessee.\nThe two, who were thought to be in a sexual relationship, were last spotted two days later.\nTheir last confirmed sighting prior to the arrest was at a Walmart in Oklahoma, 700 miles away from home, after they had both dyed their hair.\nCourt papers filed recently in the girl's disappearance say she was afraid of the teacher and thought she would face repercussions at school if she resisted him.\nWhen asked at a press conference if she had gone willingly, Gwyn said the question 'didn't matter'.\n'At the end of the day she's 15 years old. She's 15 years old, she's a young girl that's with a grown man that's 50 years old.\n'He needs to be held accountable for kidnapping this girl,' he said.\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com Thursday, Elizabeth’s relieved mother said: 'All I want to do now is hug and kiss her.'\nKimberly Thomas, 48, feared she might never see the 15-year-old girl again after she vanished more than five weeks ago with her married teacher.\n'It's only been a little over a month but to us it has felt like forever,' Thomas told DailyMail.com.\n'I just lost my mother, she died of an aneurysm. She never had high blood pressure before but this was terribly stressful for her. She never got to hear her granddaughter was OK.\n'As for Mr Cummins, I don't even want to think about him right now. All I can think about is my daughter and the fact she is safe.'\nElizabeth lived with her father, Anthony Thomas, because Mrs Thomas has been prevented from having contact with her because of an ongoing abuse case that is yet to go to court.\nHowever, the mother-of-ten, who only learned her daughter had been found from a news bulletin, says she will ask her attorney to see if they can get special permission to speak.\n'The justice system has been very unfair to me throughout this ordeal. Nobody has told me anything. This is my daughter we are talking about,' she added.\nBut the girl's father claims in divorce documents filed Monday that his wife's year-long campaign of abuse against Thomas, which allegedly involved beating the teenager and locking her in a basement, left her open to being groomed.\nSpeaking to reporters last month, Jill Cummins, wife of the disgraced teacher, said that she had been close to Thomas before the pair ran away.\n'She would come to him with her problems,' Jill said, adding that she and her husband - whom she is now divorcing - would sometimes take her to church.\n'In fact, I called her our third daughter sometimes,' Jill said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447864/Man-receive-10k-reward-help-capturing-Tad-Cummins.html"}
