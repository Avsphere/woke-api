The jury also found Williams guilty of armed robbery.\nProsecutors said the then-18-year-old Williams lured Blake into an alley to kill the officer and raid a gun safe at his house.\nNo physical evidence linked Williams to the killing of Blake, nor was the murder weapon recovered. However, several of Williams' friends testified he tried to recruit them to help in the murder and robbery, and then confessed after killing Blake.\nAssistant Public Defender Dylan Barrett told jurors that investigators targeted Williams \"because of the pressure they felt to solve this crime.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4447392/Man-convicted-2010-killing-duty-Chicago-officer.html"}
