He agreed with a request by Ms Samudio's family, who argued that the goalkeeper's release before a final trial put them at risk.\nSouza signed a contract with Boa Esporte on March 13 and debuted on April 8, playing five times.\nThe club cancelled Tuesday's training session after the ruling and club directors refused to talk to the media.\nA petition by Brazilian human rights group Somos todos vitimas unidas (We are all united victims) to stop clubs from signing Souza has been signed by more than 37,000 people, while a local rights group in Varginha also campaigned against the player.\nThe 6ft 3ins shot-stopper was the main suspect in the murder of his former girlfriend, who he met at a footballers' party in 2009, and with whom he had a son.\nThe former Flamengo captain is said to have wanted his ex-partner dead so he could avoid paying child support after she gave birth to his love child.\nPolice believed Bruno planned her abduction and murder with eight others, including his wife Dayane, another ex-lover, a younger cousin and a former policeman turned hitman Luiz Santos.\nFeminist activists protested when Bruno was allowed to sign for a club after he was released from jail to appeal his sentence\nGoalkeeper Bruno Fernandes de Souza was handed a two-year contract by Brazilian club Boa Esporte after being released - but has not been ordered back to jail to continue his sentence\nBrunette Ms Samudio, who had previously claimed to have had an affair with Real Madrid ace Cristiano Ronaldo, fell pregnant after Bruno's condom burst, it is claimed.\nThe goalkeeper demanded she have an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy, instead insisting that he assume paternity of the child.\nBefore her disappearance on June 4, 2010, Ms Samudio had approached police claiming she had been held captive by Bruno and his associates, who forced her to take an illegal abortion drug.\nBruno allegedly put a gun to her head and told her: 'You don't know who I am or what I'm capable of - I'm from the favela.'\nThe baby, Bruninho, was born in February 2010, but the player refused to acknowledge he was the father.\nIn a statement to police, the footballer's teenage cousin Jorge Rosa claimed he and Romao picked up Ms Samudio and her son from a Rio de Janeiro hotel after she accepted an invitation by the footballer to talk about the paternity claims.\nAt least 20 women protested outside the club;s stadium after it was announced they had signed Bruno\nBruno was released earlier this year after serving just seven years of his 22-year sentence\nHe was photographed training with the second tier side after signing for them earlier this month\nHe said they drove her 220 miles to a property in Belo Horizonte which Bruno and his wife used as a weekend retreat, where she was held captive for six days.\nMs Samudio was then allegedly handed over to former military policeman Santos, who committed 'barbaric tortures' on her before strangling her to death with a neck tie in front of her four-month-old son.\nIt was alleged that he watched as Santos tortured her and then helped him to chop her body.\nSantos, who was allegedly paid Â£8,000 to murder her, played loud music on a stereo to drown out the woman's screams, it is claimed.\nEdson Moreira, a detective who investigated the case, said: 'His acts were almost impossible to describe without breaking down - images from the worst nightmare you could imagine.'\nBoa Esporte won the third tier division last season and now play in the Serie B - the equivalent of the Championship in England\nBruno was the main suspect in the murder of his former girlfriend Eliza Samudio\nThe goalkeeper (pictured) played 134 times for top side Flamengo in the Brazilian first division\nPolice later found Ms Samudio's four-month-old baby in a Belo Horizonte slum, alleged to have been abandoned there by Bruno's wife Dayane.\nDNA tests later proved the footballer's paternity. The child is now being looked after by Ms Samudio's mother.\nBruno, who before his arrest had been linked with a multi-million pound transfer to AC Milan and was tipped to play for Brazil at the 2014 World Cup, had also previously been linked with a move to Barcelona thanks to promising spells with Corinthians and Flamengo.\nBruno was released from prison Apac de Santa Luzia on February 24\nIn 2013, he admitted knowing she had been strangled and her remains had been fed to rottweilers, but denied ordering the killing.\nHe was also convicted of kidnapping and was sentenced to 22 years and three months for the murder and the disposal of the body.\nThe model's body was never found, but a court heard she was strangled and fed to the player's rottweiler dogs.\nBruno was released from prison Apac de Santa Luzia on February 24 and immediately sought a new club amid uproar in Brazil.\nBut the case has caused outrage among those who claim his return to football sets a terrible example in a country where there is reportedly a high level of violence against women.\nOne of the Boa Esporte's main sponsors, Nutrends Nutrition, has declared it has ended its deal with the club.\nAnd petitions against the deal are circulating with many fans declaring they will stop supporting the controversial club.\nThe club's president, Rone Moraes da Costa, was forced to release a statement and said that Boa Esporte were doing a positive thing by trying to restore a person into society by giving him work.\nHe is alleged to have wanted his ex-partner dead so he could avoid paying child support after she gave birth to his love child. He had previously tried to force her to have an abortion\nHe was also convicted of kidnapping and was sentenced to 22 years and three months for the murder and the disposal of the body\nHe said the club 'was not responsible for the release and freedom of the athlete, Bruno, but the club and the team, as a company, represented by human beings, endowed with justice and legality, can say that they tried to do justice by helping a human being.'\nIn a further complication, Montes Claros Football Club president Ville Mocelin said on Friday that goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes is still in contract with the Brazilian club until 2019.\nThe five-year deal was signed in February 2014, while the footballer was still in prison, and also caused uproar at the time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446502/Footballer-fed-partner-dogs-ordered-jail.html"}
