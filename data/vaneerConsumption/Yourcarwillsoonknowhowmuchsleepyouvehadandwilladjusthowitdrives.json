One of the technologies it is working on is to allow the car to use health data from the watch to conduct 'driver performance assessments' when they turn on the engine (pictured) to determine how tired or stressed a motorist is\nFor example, the car's adaptive cruise control technology could increase the distance from the car in front to give the driver more time to react if they are found to be feeling tired.\nSmartwatches, like the Apple Watch and Android devices such as the Moto 360 contain a suite of sensors and apps that can monitor a wearer's pulse, movement and sleep through the day.\nFord wants to integrate these devices into its vehicles so it can use the data they gather to help make driving safer.\nFord wants smartwatches and fitness bands (pictured) to become an extension of their vehicles so they can be used to increase the interaction between a car and the driver\nEngineers have been testing technology (pictured) that alters the safety settings in a car depending on the drivers sleep the night before, as well as their stress levels, obtained using blood pressure information gathered by smartwatches like the Apple Watch and Moto 360\nEngineers working at the car manufacturer's new Automotive Wearables Experience Laboratory in Michigan said that if the car notices a driver's hear trate increasing it could also increase the gap between vehicles.\nThe car could also additionally use the smartwatch to alert the driver if they leave their car unlocked, have left a door open or left the lights on after they have parked it.\nGary Strumolo, global manager for vehicle design and infotronics at Ford Research and Advanced Engineering, said: 'As more consumers embrace smartwatches, glasses and fitness bands, we hope to develop future applications that work with those devices to enhance in-car functionality and driver awareness.\nFord says wearable technology could also be used to alert drivers if they have left a door open or left the lights on in their car. It could also use the vibrating or audible alerts (pictured) to get drivers to take over control of their vehicles when there is an accident on the road ahead, or when travelling through road works\nThe technology can use health data to adjust safety settings in the car like adaptive cruise control to increase the gap between vehicles, meaning drivers have more time to react\n'Wearable technology integrated with the vehicle allows for more accurate biometric data to stream continuously and alert active driver-assist systems to become more sensitive if the driver shows signs of compromised health or awareness.'\nEngineers are also developing ways to enable smartwatches to alert drivers of semi-autonomous vehicles when they need to take over control of the wheel.\nThey suggest the devices could vibrate, make a noise and flash if there has been an accident ahead or part of the road is closed due to construction.\nResearchers are also testing voice control for a smartwatch app they said will allow Ford drivers to remotely start, lock and unlock their vehicles.\nMr Strumolo said: 'The potential in this space is endless.\n'We're evaluating many different wearable devices and applications â€“ everything from helping to keep Ford drivers healthier and more aware behind the wheel to offering an enhanced customer experience at our dealerships.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3394206/Your-car-soon-know-sleep-ve-adjust-drives-help-avoid-accident.html"}
