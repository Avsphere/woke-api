The film stars Melissa McCarthy and Saturday Night Live alumni Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones as the titular ghost-hunters.\n“[I have been] hit with some of the worst misogynistic stuff in the last two years,” Feig said of the backlash against the film, according to Deadline. The director compared reading the hate mail he’s received to “someone coming from a liberal family and hearing right-wing radio for the first time. It’s like, my God, what’s happened? They’re monsters.”\n“The fact that there are people who take any type of umbrage with [the movie] is mind-boggling to me,” fellow panelist and The Help Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer added.\nFeig has said previously that the negative online reaction to the film’s trailer stems from a “very small minority” of “bullies” in the geek community who “write misogyny and hate and threats.”\n“The geek world has been a haven for so many of us and we should all refuse to let these bullies hijack the conversations and debates we all love to engage in, nor should we let them represent our community and culture to the rest of the world,” the director wrote in May. “The bullies are not the norm and I would dare say they are not even true geeks. They are the micro minority.”\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, the backlash against the film has prompted a number of progressive-leaning media outlets to publish articles condemning all criticism of the new Ghostbusters films as misogynistic and hateful. Critics contend that they don’t believe the film looks particularly good.\nIn an interview with Uproxx earlier this month, previous Feig collaborator Judd Apatow said that the film’s early critics share ideological similarities with a certain GOP presidential candidate.\n“I would assume there’s a very large crossover of people who are doubtful Ghostbusters will be great and people excited about the Donald Trump candidacy. I would assume they are the exact same people,” Apatow told the outlet. “That movie is made by the great Paul Feig and stars the funniest people on Earth, so I couldn’t be more excited.”\nGhostbusters is in theaters July 15.\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2016/06/05/director-paul-feig-ghostbusters-haters-misogynistic-right-wing-radio-monsters/"}
