You have a lot of fake videos now.'\nAnd referring to footage which showed people foaming at the mouth, which sent shockwaves around the world, he said: 'We don't know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhun. Were they dead at all?'\nIn response to US President Donald Trump's declaration that Assad was to blame, and subsequent air strike on a Syrian air field, the dictator said Trump must 'eat his words', 'swallow his pride', and perform a u-turn if he wants survive in the job.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446766/French-intelligence-report-says-Assad-forces-April-4-sarin-attack.html"}
