Fox already owns just over 39 percent of Sky. That values the entire broadcaster at 18.5 billion pounds. Sky says some terms are pending and a definitive deal is not certain.\nMurdoch had previously tried to take full control of Sky but was sidelined in 2011 amid a phone-hacking scandal at his British newspapers that rocked the U.K. political and media establishment. The outcry has largely died down since then.\nSky shares soared by more than 25 percent to 10.50 pounds on the London Stock Exchange after Friday's announcement.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-rupert-murdochs-21st-century-fox-to-buy-all-of-europes-sky-2016-12"}
