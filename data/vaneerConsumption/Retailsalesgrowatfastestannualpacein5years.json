May's figure was revised sharply higher from an initial estimate of 0.8 percent.\nAmericans are confident about the economic outlook, with the unemployment rate near an 18 year-low and the economy accelerating after a sluggish first quarter. Retail sales rose 6.6 percent from a year earlier, the fastest annual pace in five years.\nStill, some of the spending increases, such as gas station sales, simply reflect higher prices. Excluding auto dealers and gas stations, sales rose 0.3 percent in June.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/retail-sales-grow-at-fastest-annual-pace-in-5-years-2018-7"}
