Not long after the world's most amicable separation —sorry, conscious uncoupling — Gwyneth Paltrow is dating someone new. According to reports, the Goop CEO is currently in a relationship with Brad Falchuk, who's co-creator of Glee. As the story goes, the two met on set when Paltrow was guest-starring as Holly Holliday. Their relationship started out profesh, but then turned into something more. The pair was recently spotted having a romantical 2-hour dinner at a sexy restaurant in Los Angles shortly before jetting off for an even more sexy and romantical (I surmise?) weekend away in Utah. Crazy, right?! Here we were, all this time, thinking there was a chance she and Martin would reconcile and get back together, and in actuality, she's dating someone new! That, Gwynnie. Also, keeping us on our toes.\nAnyway, onto the question everyone is wondering: Who the hell is this Brad Falchuk guy?\n1. He's much more than the creator of Glee.\nDespite Glee being Falchuk's most successful endeavor thus far, it's certainly not his first (and only) rodeo. Falchuk worked on Nip/Tuck (yes, where he met fellow Glee creator, Ryan Murphy), and he also created American Horror Story (with Murphy again). He was nominated for an Emmy for AHS for Outstanding Miniseries or Movie in both 2013 and 2014.\n2. He's divorced.\nFrederick M. Brown/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nGwyneth isn't the only person bringing baggage to the table in their relationship. Falchuk was married to a woman named Suzanne for 10 years before she filed for divorce in March of 2013. The couple reportedly have a son and daughter together.\n3. He was diagnosed with a serious problem on his spinal cord.\nIn 2008, Falchuk woke up with a tingly feeling in his left arm, which was originally diagnosed as a tumor on his spine. Terrifying. He's since had surgery and is okay, and his experience is said to have inspired the episode of Glee , \"Wheels.\"\n4. His brother ran for Governor of Massachusetts.\nBrad's brother, Evan, founded the United Independent Party and ran for Massachusetts governor in 2014. Brad, understandably, was a big supporter of his older brother.\n5. He's an adventurous eater.\nRisking his life for a tasty bite. Wonder what Gwynnie would think of that?\nImages: Glee Reaction GIFs/Tumblr; Getty","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35626-who-is-brad-falchuk-gwyneth-paltrows-alleged-new-man-is-so-different-than-chris-martin"}
