If so, let’s just have robots running the whole thing, forget the whole idea of parenting.'\n'There are plenty of parents who like the idea of one of those parents being there as much as they possibly can, or can afford to be, to look after those kids and raise them.'\nSocial media users supported Fordham's claims that women should not be shamed for staying at home and looking after children, with one Twitter user pointing out the irony that the study was released so close to International Women's Day.\nStay-at-home mothers took to Twitter to support Fordham's claims on The Today Show\nOne user pointed out the study was released just after the world celebrated International Women's Day\nThe study singled out stay-at-home mums as hurting Australia's economy, reports The Daily Telegraph.\nHousewives are the country's 'greatest untapped potential' according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) who claim there are 'potentially large losses to the economy when women stay at home or work short part-time hours'.\nBeing paid for work was also found to be an important factor for a mother's happiness, according to the employment study.\nWomen deciding to stay at home to look after their family is hurting Australia's economy, a study by OECD claims (stock image)\nBut Parenthood executive director Jo Briskey says some women are unable to go into full-time employment as they can't afford childcare.\nBut she added it's important women have the choice.\n'Women need flexible work arrangements and a supportive workplace that helps them meet their responsibilities at work and home,' she told the Daily Telegraph.\n'If they want to stay home it's an incredibly important job looking after kids — not just for the family but to build society.'\nThe employment study found women were better educated than their male counterparts with over half of 25-34 year olds with a degree, while only 43 per cent of men have one.\nResearch also showed around half of single mothers were in paid work, while 45 per cent of mother in a relationship worked part-time jobs.\nParenthood executive director Jo Briskey (pictured) says some women are unable to go into full-time employment as they can't afford childcare","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4299754/2GB-host-Ben-Fordham-defends-stay-home-mums.html"}
