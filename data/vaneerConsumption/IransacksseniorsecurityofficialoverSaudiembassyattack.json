We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy,\" wrote Zarif.\nBaratlou's sacking was followed by the replacement of General Hassan Arabsorkhi, head of police special forces in Tehran.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393745/Iran-sacks-senior-security-official-Saudi-embassy-attack.html"}
