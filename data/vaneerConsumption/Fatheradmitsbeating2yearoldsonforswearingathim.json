Also he refused to go to sleep and that angered him more,” said Douglas County Sheriff’s Investigator Jay Davies.\nPhysical evidence showed the boy had bruises on his torso and abdomen, Davies said.\n“There was a bite mark on the child’s shoulder, on his back,” Davies said in court. “There were also contusions behind the ears, which is common in child abuse cases when a child is hit in the head.”\nAt first, Craig told investigators that his son got sick and may have had an allergic reaction after eating at a seafood restaurant, Channel 2 reported.\nBut after further questioning, Craig admitted to attacking the boy.\n“He acknowledged biting the child,” Davies said. That he punched him in the stomach and the chest.”\nThe investigator said the medical examiner found the toddler had several broken ribs, Channel 2 reported.\nKing’s mother, Shovannie Davis, was in the courtroom, according to the station.\n“I couldn’t bear with it, that’s why I had to step outside,” she told reporters. “Just hearing something like that was done to my child hurt me.”\nShe said the boy’s father never demonstrated any abusive behavior toward her their son in the past, according to Channel 2.\nKing’s grandmother said she felt depressed before, but now she felt angry.\n“I want justice for King,” Spanky Davis said. “I want justice to be served.”\nCraig did not enter a plea during his first court appearance, according to Channel 2.\nHe is being charged with cruelty to children and felony murder.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/father-admits-beating-year-old-son-for-swearing-him/IN6Ho7QuVOw32zR407QfnL/"}
