A similar demonstration was held in the west coast city of Gonaives.\nIn Port-au-Prince, many people wore T-shirts emblazoned with the photo of Jovenel Moise, the outgoing president's chosen successor and the beneficiary of a relatively well-financed campaign.\nSupporters of presidential candidate Jovenel Moise of the PHTK political party, demonstrate in the street during a march to demand elections in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016. A presidential and legislative runoff was called off less than 48 hours before the Jan. 24 vote was set to begin amid a surge of violent protests and deep suspicion that a first round was rigged in favor of Moise, the ruling party's presidential candidate.

In contrast to recent anti-government protests, Thursday's march had no flaming street barricades, rock-throwing partisans and clashes with police.\n\"We are demanding the second round of presidential elections be held so the voice of Haiti's voters will be respected,\" accountant Jean Baptiste Nacal said as people nearby danced to a popular carnival song. \"We don't want any transition government.\"\nHaiti had been scheduled to hold a runoff presidential vote last weekend. But less than 48 hours before the vote, electoral authorities postponed it indefinitely amid violent opposition protests and suspicion that the first round was marred by rampant fraud favoring Moise.\nThe threat of instability has prompted the Organization of American States to authorize a special mission to Haiti to help polarized factions negotiate a new date for the runoff and resolve a looming constitutional crisis.\nPresident Michel Martelly, who cannot run for a second consecutive term, is required under the Constitution to leave office by Feb. 7.\nFor days, the country's political leaders and others with influence have been working to find a way out of Haiti's latest election mess.\nMartelly broke his public silence on Thursday, addressing people in an impoverished Port-au-Prince area that is considered an opposition stronghold. He insisted he was trying hard to find a solution.\n\"On February 7, if no agreement is reached, I'm not going to leave the country in uncertainty,\" Martelly said.\nSenate President Jocelerme Privert has told The Associated Press that Martelly told him in several recent meetings that he would step down on schedule Feb. 7.\n___\nDavid McFadden on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dmcfadd\nA supporter of presidential candidate Jovenel Moise of the PHTK political party, holds up a campaign poster during a march to demand elections in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016.
