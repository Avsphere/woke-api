Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson agreed with Tiede's appeals attorney, Jodi Cole, who said he deserved a lighter sentence because he and Nugent had an abusive relationship before her death. Cole also argued that Tiede's being sexually assaulted as a child was a factor as well.\nNugent disappeared in 1996. Her corpse was found nine months later at her Carthage home about 150 miles east of Dallas, wrapped in a sheet lying among packages of frozen corn, pecans and meat. She had been shot in the back four times with a .22-caliber rifle.\nTiede had met Nugent in 1990 at the funeral of her husband R.L. \"Rod\" Nugent, who had made his fortune in oil and banking. The two would grow close, taking trips around the world, and Nugent signed a will leaving her estimated $10 million fortune to Tiede.\nTiede became known around town for his generosity. Townspeople have said he started scholarships, pledged money to a church building campaign and ran a fundraising drive for Boy Scouts. He also gave away large gifts, including several cars.\nAfter Tiede was charged in Nugent's killing, pretrial publicity led to the case being moved to San Augustine, about 50 miles southeast of Carthage. A jury there convicted him in 1999 and sentenced him to life in prison.\n-- The Associated Press","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-mortician-whose-killing-widow-inspired-movie-freed-early-n98616"}
