Certainly very different than the standard it advocates when considering allowing dental therapists to operate in the state.\nIn 2012, when the California Senate was considering a proposal aimed at improving dental care for underserved children by, among other proposals, authorizing a project to explore new workforce training and delivery models such as dental therapists, the CDA’s support included its admonition that “A rigorous scientific study on the safety, quality and cost-effectiveness of allowing certain procedures, such as fillings, to be performed by non-dentists is needed. It is not appropriate for California to create any kind of provider without this assurance, and therefore CDA is opposed to any changes in scopes of practice until such compelling data exists.”\nApparently, the CDA feels the risk of therapists performing treatment under the supervision of dentists requires far greater verification of safety than the risk of dentists performing treatment while simultaneously administering and monitoring general anesthesia.\nDoes this approach accurately reflect the risk/benefit differences between these two paradigms?\nSteven Krauss, DDS, MPH, MBA\nWoodmere, NY","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/a-dentist-questions-safety-paradigms/"}
