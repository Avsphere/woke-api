The four page document covered areas of agreement and issues for further action.\nAhead of the summit, some predicted , as Reuters did, that Mnuchin would be met with resistance from the other 19 world economies. Results of the summit did not support that prediction.\nSecretary Mnuchin posted photos with officials from ten nations at the summit, including Mnuchin’s counterpart from Mexico:\nSpoke with my Mexican counterpart @JAGlezAnaya about cooperation on economic issues important to both nations. pic.twitter.com/p2Mi2JdUA8 — Steven Mnuchin (@stevenmnuchin1) July 22, 2018\nGreat first meeting with Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria.

CNN reported he held 14 bilateral meetings in all.\n“We had good conversations. We have trade disputes that we are trying to resolve,” Mnuchin said of the meetings, according to CNN. He dismissed the idea that they were divided.\nAt least two of the meetings, those with Tria and Carney, included talk of the United Kingdom’s plans to leave the European Union with “Brexit.”\nIn these meetings, the U.S. Treasury secretary also discussed the importance of a strong bilateral relationship with Scholz and Tria, according to Treasury Department-provided readouts of the meetings. With Scholz, Aso, and Tria he specifically discussed “security issues of mutual concern.” Aso and Mnuchin also “reaffirmed the strong economic relationship between the United States and Japan.”\nAl-Jadaan and Mnuchin discussed the importance of the relationship between their two countries and “ongoing efforts towards combatting illicit finance.”\nMnuchin and Carney discussed “the importance of the Financial Stability Board to the international economy” and “issues relating to cryptocurrency and fintech.”\nSec. Mnuchin “encouraged President Macri and his economic team to continue implementation of their pro-growth economic reform program,” according to treasury secretary. He also reaffirmed the strength and depth of the economic relationship between their two countries. Argentine Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne also attended the meeting.\nDujovne made clear that an end-of-summit agreement was aimed not at denying certain trade disagreements, but focusing on “a strong and clear vision to keep this group alive and functioning in harmony.” CNN reported Dujovne’s position that the Argentina summit communique was easier than past G20 summits: “The trade language was accepted right away.”\nMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/07/23/mnuchin-welcomed-productive-g20-argentina-summit/"}
