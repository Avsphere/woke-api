His strike-rate is outstanding.\nThanks to everyone for your messages! Playing for @England has been my dream since day one so to be back in the squad is so special for me. — Jermain Defoe (@IAmJermainDefoe) March 16, 2017\n“I didn’t want to look at his age and think he’s finished with England.”\nDefoe earned the nod ahead of Andy Carroll, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck, all of whom were name-checked at Thursday’s announcement by Southgate, who showed he was not afraid to be bold with his first squad since being appointed on a permanent basis.\nUncapped Southampton pair James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond will travel to Dortmund next week, even though Southgate confirmed they will be in Poland with the Under-21s this summer, while Phil Jones, Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Shaw were all brought back into the fold.\nYet the inclusion that raised the most eyebrows was that of West Brom midfielder Livermore, capped just once previously five years ago.\n🗣 \"It's a great reward for him – he's battled back from some personal difficulties. I'm sure he'll be delighted.\" https://t.co/3dAeKRw1eF — England (@England) March 16, 2017\nIn 2015 the 27-year-old tested positive for cocaine and was cleared to return in September that year less than two weeks after the Football Association took the death of his newborn son as exceptional mitigating circumstances.\n“The decision to call him up is positional,” Southgate explained.\n“Without (Jordan) Henderson and (Danny) Drinkwater we need to find some solutions in defensive midfield players.\n“He’s a different sort of profile to other midfield players we might have picked. From his own journey it’s an incredible story and I’m sure he’s taken a lot of strength from what he’s been through over the last year or so. It’s great to see him now back in the fold.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4320496/Jermain-Defoe-surprise-names-England-squad.html"}
