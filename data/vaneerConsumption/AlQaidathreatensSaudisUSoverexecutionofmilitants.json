He vowed to continue battling America and said the Saudis will be dealt with in a \"different way,\" without elaborating.\n\"By God, we will not let you go as long as there is a pulsing vein in our body,\" he said, addressing the Americans.\nAl-Asiri is believed to have built the sophisticated bombs used in a failed attempt to bring down a U.S. passenger plane and a failed assassination attempt on Saudi Arabia's then-deputy interior minister in 2009.\nSaudi Arabia executed 47 people earlier this month, including several al-Qaida militants, in its largest mass execution since 1980.\nAl-Qaida carried out a wave of attacks in the kingdom a decade ago targeting security forces and compounds housing foreigners. A sweeping crackdown largely dismantled the group, but some militants later fled to Yemen, where they reconstituted the affiliate, calling it al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3393942/Al-Qaida-threatens-Saudis-US-execution-militants.html"}
