In a bid to highlight the fattening effect, the Royal Society of Public Health has decided to highlight these drink-food equivalents\nThe move means AB InBev UK is going above and beyond the pledge made by industry body Brewers of Europe, whose members have agreed to provide full information on ingredients, energy and nutritional values per 100ml either on label and/or online.\nHowever, the company is not alone. Last March, Diageo, which makes Guinness and Smirnoff, said it would put ‘per serve’ calorie information on its packaging.\nTreasury Wine Estates recently revealed plans to provide the information online and include a dedicated web address on its bottles. Sainsbury’s introduced calorie information on 20 of its own label wines back in 2014.\nAB InBev’s Anna Tolley said: ‘Consumers are getting savvier about their daily calorie consumption and are actively looking at nutritional information.\n‘While the EU continues to discuss the best way forward for nutritional labelling in our industry, we want to give consumers the information they need at their fingertips to make well informed choices and enjoy our products responsibly.’\nThe firm’s UK marketing chief, Nick Robinson, said: ‘We have to ensure full information for all our beers is easily available so consumers can decide which beer is right for them on which occasion.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3394000/How-calories-guzzling-Beers-including-Stella-Becks-Budweiser-list-ingredients-bid-stem-obesity-crisis.html"}
