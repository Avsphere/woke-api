They say a handgun was found inside the locked vehicle and that investigators found no evidence of a struggle.\nThe car with Hunt's body inside it was discovered Sunday near the Wake Forest University campus.\nAuthorities said they're awaiting final autopsy results. Friends have told various media outlets that Hunt had been diagnosed with cancer.\nHunt was convicted twice in the death of copy editor Deborah Sykes. He was exonerated in February 2004 on the basis of DNA evidence that led police to another suspect, who confessed.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/mar/16/police-man-exonerated-murder-likely-died-suicide/?page=1"}
