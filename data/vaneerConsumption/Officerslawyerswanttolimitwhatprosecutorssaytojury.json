(AP) - Attorneys want to limit what prosecutors can tell jurors in the federal civil rights trial of a white ex-South Carolina police officer who's accused in a black motorist's shooting death.\nCourt documents filed Wednesday show attorneys for Michael Slager want a judge to limit prosecutors' ability to bring up any anguish suffered by the family of Walter Scott or any references to Slager's mental state.\nAttorneys for Slager and the government are scheduled to be in court Friday to hash out issues ahead of his May trial. Slager is accused of violating Scott's civil rights when he shot him to death as the motorist ran from a traffic stop in April 2015.\nSlager is also charged with murder in state court. His first trial there ended in a hung jury.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4320690/Officers-lawyers-want-limit-prosecutors-say-jury.html"}
