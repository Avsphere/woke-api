It gives reality on the ground to a redrawn geopolitical map,\" he said.\nJassem Mohammed Jaafar, a Turkmen MP, also accused the Kurds of using the war against IS as a pretext to further the expansion, and ultimately the secession, of their region.\n- 'Fait accompli' -\n\"It is against international conventions, it violates the rights of the people who end up on one or the other side of it,\" he told AFP.\n\"There is little doubt that this trench is part of a project to divide Iraq,\" Jaafar said.\nThe KRG acknowledged it had recently stepped up the fortification of its frontline with IS but it denied any political motive.\n\"The purpose of the trench is to build a defensive system against vehicles used by Daesh (IS) terrorists who blow up car bombs,\" peshmerga spokesman Jabar Yawar said.\n\"It is two metres deep and three wide. It is not everywhere, some areas don't need it. It is the military leadership that makes this decision,\" he said.\nTurkmen officials said their information showed that the planned path of the trench would include the town of Tuz Khurmatu in the Kurdish region and leave that of Amerli out.\nThe trench has not been dug there yet but work has begun in areas around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and in the Jalawla region near the Iranian border, they said.\nMehdi Saadoun, an activist from the Turkmen Rescue Foundation, said the trench was being used to further Kurdish nationalist ambitions.\n\"Seventy to 80 percent of the areas to be included on the KRG side are Turkmen areas,\" he said.\n\"They will include Tal Afar, Kirkuk (and) Tuz Khurmatu if the government does not enforce the law on preserving the unity of Iraq,\" Saadoun said.\n\"Daesh is the excuse the Kurdish forces are using to impose a fait accompli by digging this trench,\" he said.\nThe governor of Kirkuk province, Najmeddin Karim, said he supported any measure making the area safer.\n\"We support the decisions and measures taken by the peshmerga because they guarantee the security and stability of all the people of Kirkuk, without any discrimination,\" he said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3394370/Iraq-Turkmens-alarmed-Kurdish-trench.html"}
