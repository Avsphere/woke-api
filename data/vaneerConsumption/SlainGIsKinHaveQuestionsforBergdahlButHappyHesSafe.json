The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe family of an Army private killed during the search for Bowe Bergdahl said Tuesday they are glad the freed sergeant is coming back to America to be reunited with his family â€” and to face an inquiry into whether he deserted his unit.\n\"We're happy that he's home,\" said Travis Wright, brother of Pfc. Matthew Martinek, 20, who was killed in an ambush in eastern Afghanistan in September 2009.\n\"He's an American and deserves to be home, but we want to know what happened.\"\nUp to six U.S. soldiers may have been killed while looking for Bergdahl or supporting the search effort after he vanished from his base and was captured by the Taliban.\nSome family members have blasted Bergdahl as a deserter, pinned their loved ones' deaths on him and criticized the White House for releasing five Taliban leaders to secure his freedom.\nBut Wright, an Army captain who said he took part in 2012 search mission for Bergdahl, cautioned against a rush to judgment and said no matter why he left the base, he had to be rescued.\n\"He is an American and he is a soldier and we take care of our own,\" he said.\n\"You never leave a man behind.\"\nThat's the justification the White House and Pentagon have given for the prisoner swap, which has raised hackles among GOP lawmakers who say the U.S. should not have negotiated with terrorists and some veterans who suggest Bergdahl has blood on his hands.\n\"Every single mission we did was pointed toward finding Berghdahl,\" former Army medic Josh Cornelison said of operations around Paktika Province in the 90 days after the disappearance.\n\"Every single person that died was doing something to find Bowe Berghdahl.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bowe-bergdahl-released/slain-g-i-s-kin-have-questions-bergdahl-happy-hes-n121491"}
