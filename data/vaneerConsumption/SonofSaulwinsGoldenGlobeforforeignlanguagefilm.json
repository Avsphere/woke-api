(AP) — The writer-director of \"Son of Saul\" is hopeful that his win for best foreign language film at the Golden Globes will serve as a reminder not to echo the Holocaust.\n\"The Holocaust has become, over the years, an abstraction,\" Nemes told the crowd Sunday at the Beverly Hilton while accepting his trophy. \"For me, it's more of a face, a human face. Let us not forget this face.\"\nNemes' concentration camp drama centers on a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner (played by Geza Rohri) who tirelessly searches for a rabbi to give a child a proper burial.\nGeza Rohrig, left, and Laszlo Nemes, from \"Son of Saul\" pose at The 41st Annual Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards at the InterContinental hotel on Saturday, Jan. 9, 2016 in Los Angeles.

I think we have to look into the human soul, and cinema can do that in a very visceral way. I think that's why I wanted to make this film.\"\nHungary's \"Son of Saul\" bested Belgium's \"The Brand New Testament,\" Chile's \"The Club,\" Finland's \"The Fencer\" and France's \"Mustang\" at the 73rd annual ceremony.\nNemes was joined backstage by Rohri, who plays a man tasked with burning bodies at an Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\"It's important for today's generation and future generations to understand that history is not only a postcard,\" said Nemes. \"It's something that can be here and now.\"\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.goldenglobes.com\n___\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Derrik J.
