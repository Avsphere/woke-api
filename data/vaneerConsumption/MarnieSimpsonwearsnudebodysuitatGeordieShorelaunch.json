I have never cheated, wouldn't cheat and didn't deserve to be cheated on for this.'\nGlam: The glossy look was even complete with a brown lipstick\nWelcome to the new series: Marnie was introducing the New Radgie Rampage series\nTough stuff: Her cousin Sophie Kasaei, who was recently reinstated into the cast after being booted off the show for making an alleged racist slur in 2013, opted to tough up the ensemble with leather trousers and a slinky striped shirt\nCheeky! Chloe Ferry went for a similarly edgy look as she slipped into a white crop top paired with high-waisted black leggings and a staggering pair of nude heels","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4319656/Newly-single-Marnie-Simpsonwears-clingy-nude-bodysuit.html"}
