Finally, the NBC peacock wobbles forward and falls on its face, spilling its drink.\n“Wow, I was so busy not seeing color, I didn’t see the raping either,” jokes Peter.\nFamily Guy has taken numerous shots at Cosby over the years, well before dozens of women came forward with sexual assault allegations against the comedian.
