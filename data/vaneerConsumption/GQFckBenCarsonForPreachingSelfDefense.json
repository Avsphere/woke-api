While establishment puds like Jeb! Bush and Marco Rubio can’t decide if they want to beat Trump or emulate him, the Good Doctor made it clear this week that he is not only willing to replicate Trump’s signature brand of hot-garbage-spewing, but he’ll say even DUMBER shit. Here is Carson from earlier in the week on the Oregon shooter:\nIt gets worse.\nThis is Clarence Thomas all over again. A black man seeks to rise to a position of power and because he dares to stray from The Liberal Thought Plantation, at every opportunity, including fabricated ones like this, the media piles on to destroy the black apostate as dumb, crazy, scary or a combination of all three.\nThe real idiots here are the Gun Control Truthers on the left, and this includes the mainstream media.\nThey know gun control will do nothing to stop these school shootings. They even admit it.\nThey know that after 12 of these mass-shooting events (not all of them successful, thankfully) that we’re going to have another one soon, and yet the Left is suggesting NOTHING to prevent the next one. Democrats and their media allies keep using piles of dead children to push a gun control agenda that will do nothing to stop the next pile of dead bodies.\nGQ and CNN and MSNBC have been hammering Carson all week for daring to suggest an actual plan in the event this happens again. It’s not a perfect plan but it could at least the reduce the size of the pile and give these kids a direction that might save some lives.\nBarack Obama’s plan is for these kids to keep dying.\nThe Democrats’ plan is for these kids to keep dying\nThe media’s plan is for these kids to keep dying.\nCarson is suggesting the kind of self-reliance in a nothing-to-lose situation that might actually make a difference, and for that he’s being savaged by an elite media that will never do anything other than attempt to destroy a black man who thinks for himself.\nIn every GQ, CNN, MSNBC attack against Carson the subtext screams, “We gotta git that uppity boy’s mind right.”\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2015/10/08/gq-fck-ben-carson-for-preaching-self-defense/"}
