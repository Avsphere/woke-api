William Schabas will serve as Chair of the three-person commission mandated by the Council at its last special session.\nIn case you had any doubts that the UN is in the business of inciting anti-Israel hatred, using US funds, here’s an announcement put out by its Human Rights Council on 8-11-14\nThe Council decided to establish the commission of inquiry at its twenty-first special session on 23 July 2014 to investigate all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014, whether before, during or after, to establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and to identify those responsible, to make recommendations, in particular on accountability measures, all with a view to avoiding and ending impunity and ensuring that those responsible are held accountable, and on ways and means to protect civilians against any further assaults. The same resolution requested that the commission of inquiry present a written report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session in March 2015. The same resolution requested the High-Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the implementation of the resolution, including on measures taken with regard to ensuring accountability for the serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, to the Council at its twenty-seventh session in September 2014. Biographies of the members of the Commission of Inquiry Amal Alamuddin (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) is a London-based, British-Lebanese lawyer. She graduated from St Hugh’s College, Oxford and is specialised in international law, criminal law, human rights and extradition. She worked at the International Court of Justice in 2004 and her previous functions also included that of legal adviser to the Prosecutor of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Doudou Diène (Senegal) was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance from 2002 to 2008 and the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Côte d’Ivoire from 2011 to 2014. Mr. Diène holds a doctorate in public law from the University of Paris law degree from the University of Caen (France) He holds a law degree from the University of Caen and a doctorate in public law from the University of Paris. William Schabas (Canada) is professor of international law at Middlesex University in London. He is also professor of international criminal law and human rights at Leiden University as well as emeritus professor human rights law at the Irish Centre for Human Rights of the National University of Ireland Galway. From 2002 to 2004, he served as one of three international members of the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Mr. Schabas was also a member and Chair of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in Human Rights and has drafted the 2010 report of the Secretary-General on the status of the death penalty.\nOccupied Palestinian Territory? The “occupier” obviously means Israel. Who else? But “occupied Gaza Strip?” How can that mean Israel? Well, never mind. The inhabitants of Gaza “feel” occupied and Hamas has told the world they are right. That’s evidently good enough for the UN Human Rights Commission. The language is probably old boilerplate but hey, why bother to update? It’s on the “right” side of the issue, right? Right.\n“[M]ilitary operations conducted since 13 June 2014” obviously is also a reference to Israel. But wait: Hasn’t Hamas been firing rockets into Israel for a while now? Didn’t the IDF go in to put a stop to the rockets? Well, Hamas has not been conducting “military operations.” Hamas, you see, is in an “armed struggle” to liberate the “occupied” Palestinian people. Those are “freedom rockets.” The UN sides with Hamas again.\nEvidently UN eloquence was too much for the lawyer at the top of the list, Amal Alamuddin. She, in case you didn’t know, is George Clooney’s fiancée. Yes, that George Clooney. The actor who played lawyer Miles Massey – of the unbreakable Massey Prenup – in the hilarious send-off Intolerable Cruelty. George, you see, wants to keep his job and continue to make millions of bucks in Tinseltown working for Jewish directors like the Coen Brothers and Steven Spielberg.\nSo, only hours after the UN announcement, Miss Alamuddin begged off, citing a busy schedule:\nI am honored to have received the offer, but given existing commitments - including eight ongoing cases - unfortunately could not accept this role. I wish my colleagues who will serve on the commission courage and strength in their endeavors.\nTranslation: “I just got off the phone with George and he sounded a little doubtful about our upcoming wedding.”\nA replacement (useful idiot) will soon be found to help the remaining commissioners. Please note that the Russians and the Chinese have not chimed in on what has been happening in Gaza, so it won’t be one of them. Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo, who urged the EU to fight on the side of Hamas, is also unlikely to get the nod. Not to worry, though. There’s no shortage of people who hate Israel but can be relied upon to put on a good show of “objectivity” investigating “human rights violations.”","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/08/smarter_than_bardem_and_cruz.html"}
