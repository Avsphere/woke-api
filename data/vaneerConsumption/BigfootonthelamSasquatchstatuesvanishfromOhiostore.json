She's reviewing surveillance video for clues.\nTwo statues had been mounted on pedestals in front of her shop in Beaver Township, in rural northeast Ohio.\nOne is 3.5 feet (1.07 meters) tall. Another is 2.25 feet (0.69 meters). The third is considered the \"baby\" Bigfoot.\nFitzer says they range in value from $55 to $150.\n___\nInformation from: WFMJ-TV, http://www.wfmj.com","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4448238/Bigfoot-lam-Sasquatch-statues-vanish-Ohio-store.html"}
