For others, owning a dog made their dreams come true. But if you are someone who really can't get enough of dogs to where you want to include them in your travel plans, then you've come to the right place. There are plenty of places to visit if you love dogs, from dog shows to dog museums to entire dog festivals.\nDogs are an interest on their own, but there are differences amongst canine lovers, so like a dog incessantly scratching an itch, you have to find the right spot. Like the being by the water? Then try out a dog beach. Like coffee? Try out a dog café. Big fan of Bravo's Real Housewives series? There's something for you, too.\nWhile all of the places below honor dogs, many of them also promote adoption of rescue animals, which is a really cool added bonus. Not only will you be surrounded by dogs if you visit one of the places below, but with some of them you'll also be giving back. It's really a win-win.\nFrom the West to the East Coast and from Europe to Japan, here are 13 places dog lovers will love to visit.\n1. The Dog Café — Los Angeles, California\nThe Dog Café allows visitors to hang out with dogs, have a beverage, and even adopt a dog if they like, since the dogs are available for adoption. According to its website, \"The Dog Café’s mission is to revolutionize dog adoption by reinventing the way people connect with rescues who need homes.\" The cafe also features other events, like dog yoga.\n2. Dog Beach — San Diego, California\nDog Beach is in Ocean Beach, San Diego, and is one of the first off-leash dog beaches in the country. According to its website, \"On any given day, dogs run freely in the ocean, surfers surf the Dog Beach Break, and people and dogs co-exist peacefully.\" Sounds great!\n3. The Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade — New York City\nEduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images News/Getty Images\nThe annual Halloween Dog Parade held at Tompkins Square Park in New York City is known worldwide. The event is basically just a whole bunch of dogs in Halloween costumes, along with a competition for dogs and their human counterparts who enter. Sadly, this year's parade is currently canceled due to funding issues. Hopefully, that will get sorted out by the previously scheduled date of October 20, but if not, there are other Halloween dog costume contests in New York City worth checking out.\n4. Museum Of The Dog — St. Louis, Missouri\nThe Museum of the Dog is part of the American Kennel Club and features more than 700 art pieces related to dogs. Dogs are allowed in the museum and they don't even have to pay the entrance fee. It will be moving to New York City in January 2019.\n5. The Westminster Dog Show — New York City\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images News/Getty Images\nThe other big American dog show of the year is put on by the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which takes place in New York City.
