Under the new law, harassers face sentences of five months to six years in jail, as well as fines of up to 5,000 Egyptian pounds, or about $714.\nNo further details were given in relation to the apparent attack behind the video, but officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that a 19-year-old female student had been hospitalized.\nActivists were further enraged after another video circulated online in which a correspondent reporting from Tahrir told Maha Bahnassi, a female anchor on a private Egyptian television station, that isolated incidents of sexual harassment had occurred during celebrations.\n\"A culture of impunity has been running rampant the past three years, hospitals are not equipped with rape kits, the ministry of interior is committing these crimes themselves against women in public spaces.\"\n“Well, [the harassers] are happy!” Bahnassi laughed in response.\nThat response sends a chilling message about women's rights, according to activists.\n“If she’s brushing it off, then this means women’s bodies are fair game when Egyptian men are happy? They can just assault our bodies?” said Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian writer and activist who was sexually assaulted in November 2011 during clashes between protesters and security forces just off Tahrir Square.\nMob sexual assaults have soared following the country’s 2011 revolution and activists say harassment has reached endemic levels. In a 2013 United Nations study, nine out of ten Egyptian women said they had experienced some form of sexual harassment, ranging from minor harassment to rape.\nAzza Kamel, an activist with “I Saw Harassment,” a group working to combat sexual harassment in Egypt, said her group had documented at least five cases of sexual assault in Tahrir Square on Sunday night. Kamel said members of her group had also witnessed the attack on the 19-year-old student, but said she did not know who was behind the attacks.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/egypt-arrests-seven-over-sex-assaults-amid-sissi-celebrations-n126301"}
