The service was still available Thursday via other network operators.\nThe statement said PT Telekomunikas was also protecting its customers from inappropriate content such as pornography and depictions of violence that are illegal in Indonesia.\nNetflix started operating in Indonesia earlier this month as part of a broad international expansion. It currently has nearly 75 million subscribers, including 30 million outside the U.S.\nA Netflix statement said \"services delivered over the Internet present all sorts of novel questions for policymakers\" but did not confirm it was blocked. It noted that only paying customers can watch programs or films on Netflix.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420707/Indonesian-telecom-provider-blocks-access-Netflix.html"}
