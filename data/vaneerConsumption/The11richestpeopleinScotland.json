PA Donald Trump may be the most famous billionaire associated with Scotland, but what about the wealth of its permanent residents?\nThere are now a record nine billionaires in Scotland, according to the Sunday Times 2016 Rich List, which was released in April.\nSome of those fortunes derive from international businesses portfolios, while some of those come from sources closer to home.
