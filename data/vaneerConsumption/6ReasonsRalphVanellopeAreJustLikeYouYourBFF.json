It also introduced us to a beloved new pair of pals in Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), a video game villain who’s tired of being bad and just wants to be the hero for a change, and his new friend Vanellope (voiced by Sarah Silverman), a driver in a racing game called Sugar Rush. As unlikely of a pair as they may seem, watching Ralph and Vanellope's antics reminds us a lot of how we are with our own besties.\nThanks to the digital heavens, because these two beloved characters are re-loading very soon. In Ralph Breaks the Internet, hitting theaters November 21, Ralph and Vanellope leave the realm of video game arcades for an even vaster and more intimidating landscape: the World Wide Web. They’re on the hunt for a replacement part to save Sugar Rush — but the task won’t be as easy as logging into eBay. First, they must brave this new cyber wilderness, meeting friends like Shank (voiced by Gal Gadot), a gutsy driver from an intense game called Slaughter Race, and Yesss (voiced by Taraji P. Henson), an algorithm who runs a trend-making website called BuzzzTube.\nBut even with the help of their \"netizen\" buddies like Yesss and Shank, the Internet is a crazy place full of pop-up ads, search engines, spammers, and ornery net users (avatars that represent humans who are online). Luckily, Ralph and Vanellope can help each other make sense of it all. The more we think about it, the more we’re convinced that Ralph and Vanellope are just like any other pair of BFFs out there, virtual or real. Allow us to present our evidence…\n1. They're There For Each Other\nWith these two besties, there's no question that one will be there for the other when things spin out. When a player breaks the Sugar Rush steering wheel leaving Vanellope unable to race, there's no question that Ralph will be there to help her fix it. Reminds me of the time my pants ripped down the seam, and my BFF let me tie her sweatshirt around my waist! (It’s almost the same thing, right?)\n2. They Share In The Joy Of Cat Content\nWho among us doesn’t spend at least 30 percent of her day sending their BFF cat photos and other memes? When they enter the world of the net, Ralph and Vanellope experience the magical pull of cats-on-the-web together when they’re both captivated by a painting of a kitten with big, sad eyes. Was this ripped from my life? Yes. Am I watching cat videos right now? Yes.\n3. They Have Crazy Adventures Together\nIn this next installment of the Wreck It Ralph saga, Ralph and Vanellope embark on a madcap adventure that takes them out of their homes and their comfort zones. No plan? No problem! This leaves them open to adventure. Kind of like that time you and your bestie went on that camping trip without first considering your lack of wilderness knowledge or survival skills.\n4. They Meet New People, Side By Side\nIt’s fun to make friends on your own, but it can be even more exciting to make friends alongside your BFF. Just like you and your college pal might have linked up with the girls down the hall to head to the cafeteria, Ralph and Vanellope link up with characters like Shank, Yesss, and the search engine/ bottomless pit of Internet knowledge Knowsmore (voiced by Alan Tudyk) to understand their new surroundings together.\n5. They Make Memories Together\nNothing strengthens a relationship’s foundation like a shared history. Think of your high school bestie who shares memories of freshman year, the prom, and that weird-but-hilarious calculus class you were in together. Similarly, Ralph and Vanellope have two whole movies’ worth of adventures to reminisce about for years to come.\n6. They Help Each Other Become Better People\nForgive us while we get a little sappy, but… just like you help your BFF become the person she’s meant to be, Vanellope and Ralph help each other grow. She helps him transcend his “villain” label, and he helps her become the racer she was always destined to become. I'm not crying ... You're crying!\nThis article is sponsored by Disney's Ralph Breaks The Internet, loading in theaters November 21st!","url":"https://www.bustle.com/p/6-reasons-ralph-vanellope-are-just-like-you-your-bff-12982017"}
