The move was described as sending a signal after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its \"increasing pressure\" in the region.\nWhen presenting the agency's annual report, Thornberg said it had investigated an undisclosed number of cases where people were suspected of giving out classified information to foreign governments.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319352/Swedens-intel-agency-real-threat.html"}
