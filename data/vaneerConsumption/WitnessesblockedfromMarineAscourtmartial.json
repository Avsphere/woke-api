I am very pleased Sgt Blackman has now been dealt with justly.’\nJudges downgraded Alexander Blackman's conviction to manslaughter after accepting expert evidence he had combat stress. The sergeant – known as Marine A when he was jailed for life at his trial – said a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He could walk free within days.\nFamily: Claire Blackman, wife of Sergeant Alexander Blackman, has fought for her husband to be released from prison and was cheered wildly as his murder conviction was quashed yesterday\nEvidence: Royal Marines Warrant Officer Stephen Moran, who served with Sgt Blackman's regiment (shown here just before the Taliban fighter was killed in 2011) claims he was told to ‘stay out of it’ by his seniors when he telephoned his legal team about poor discipline\nMore than 30,000 Daily Mail readers helped fund the £800,000 legal challenge that led to yesterday's triumph at the Court Martial Appeal Court in London. Sgt Blackman's loyal wife Claire beamed at the verdict.\nMarine A's 'heroine' wife's message for her husband and his supporters An emotional Claire Blackman on justice for her husband Claire Blackman was cheered wildly outside court as she reacted to her husband's victory. Taxi drivers passing the Royal Courts of Justice also stopped and blared their horns during wild celebrations. Jonathan Goldberg QC called her 'the heroine of this occasion'. She said: 'We are delighted at the judges' decision to substitute manslaughter by diminished responsibility. 'This is a crucial decision and one that much better reflects the circumstances that my husband found himself in during that terrible tour of Afghanistan. 'We must now wait for the sentencing hearing and hope to secure a significant reduction in Al's sentence. 'We would like to thank our fantastic legal team of Jonathan Goldberg QC, Jeffrey Israel and Senghin Kong for their excellent work to date. 'We would also like to thank the tens of thousands of supporters, especially from the Royal Marines' family, who have stood behind us throughout and who have played such an important role in getting us to this point.'\nBut there was a deafening silence from the military commanders who let Sgt Blackman down on the battlefield then hung him out to dry at his court martial.\nThe judges reduced his conviction to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, saying he had been subjected to exceptional pressures in the lead-up to the incident.\nHe will face a new sentencing hearing in about a week, where his legal team will argue he should be freed immediately because of the three and half years he has served.\nMrs Blackman emerged from the court on the Strand yesterday to wild cheering. She was with Frederick Forsyth who, in a clear reference to top brass, called for the 'villains' who put Sgt Blackman in jail to be shamed. The Day of the Jackal author added: 'The fight is not over yet. We must free a man who has been put in jail who should never have been there.\n'Then we must go after those people who wrongly and villainously put him there.'\nMrs Blackman said: 'Al and I cannot thank the Daily Mail and its readers enough. They helped us up when we were down, and without the thousands of readers who gave their support, we would never have reached this moment.'\nSgt Blackman was not in court for the hearing but he spoke to his wife by telephone afterwards. She said: 'Al said a huge weight had been lifted. That means so much to us. We can start to think about the future now.'\nHer husband's QC, Jonathan Goldberg, said: 'The heroine, of course, is Claire Blackman. Without her indefatigable efforts to keep the flame alive on behalf of her husband and to get that debate in Parliament, which sparked the interest of the public and the Daily Mail, and which led directly to today's victory, none of this would have happened.'\nHe said the hero was Mr Forsyth, who 'knew a miscarriage of justice when he smelt one'.\nMr Goldberg added: 'In a long career as defence counsel, I recall few cases that were prosecuted as remorselessly as this one from first to last. And those ones involved dangerous criminals, not a hitherto exemplary British soldier driven way past his breaking point in an impossible war by hellish conditions and inadequate moral and material support.'\nThe judges delivered a withering ruling that smashed the notion that Sgt Blackman, 42, had conducted a 'cold-blooded execution' in September 2011. The insurgent he shot had already been mortally wounded trying to storm a British outpost in Helmand Province.\nSupport: Claire Blackman, wife of Sergeant Alexander Blackman, (centre) on the steps of The Royal Courts of Justice with her legal team and friends including Frederick Forsyth (centre right) and Jonathan Goldberg QC (far right)\nWinners: Blackman's counsel, Jonathan Goldberg QC, introduced Mrs Blackman as the 'heroine' of the story while Frederick Forsyth says they must pursue the 'villains' who put him in jail\nLed by Britain's most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, the panel hailed the sergeant as an 'exemplary soldier' who had acted entirely out of character.\nMARINE A COMRADE: 'I'M GLAD AL DID IT' Royal Marines who were on patrol with Sergeant Alexander Blackman when he shot an Afghan insurgent have spoken of their respect for him. Anthropologist and filmmaker Chris Terrill was embedded with Blackman's unit and has tracked down some of the men who were with Blackman on the day he killed the Taliban fighter while on patrol in Afghanistan on September 15 2011. The programme examines pressures faced by the Royal Marines there on tour. Interviewees featured on the programme include Blackman's comrades, speaking for the first time about the six month tour that preceded the killing. Rob Driscoll, who fought alongside Blackman in Afghanistan, said: 'Were we feral? I don't really know what we were at the end, I think we were just shell-shocked if anything. 'I don't think feral is the right word it almost implies a disregard for authority, and there was no disregard for authority. 'We respected our HQ to a degree, as much as any other soldier would on a front line. After that repetitive exposure to violence and different cultures, I'd changed.' Speaking about the killing, he said: 'Everyone wanted that guy to be dead. I'm glad Al did what he did, because all my guys went home. 'And maybe just maybe if he hadn't of done that I'd have been going to a few more funerals or laying some more flowers on people's graves, for someone I have absolutely zilch respect for because he was trying to kill my friends and me.' Sam Deen, one of Blackman's junior comrades, said: 'I said I'd put one in his head. 'Few of the other lads said that as well, I do think he took the responsibility for the younger lads ... he just took it on his shoulders; he just thought it was his responsibility to do it. 'He didn't do it in cold blood - he did it so we could draw a line in the sand.'\nThey accepted the unanimous evidence of three psychiatrists who all diagnosed an 'adjustment disorder' – a recognised mental illness – which muddled his mind. The disorder was caused by the 'quite exceptional' stresses and perils that Sgt Blackman and his men faced holding the front line at their remote base.\nHis ability to form a rational judgement and to exercise self-control on the day of the shooting were 'substantially impaired', said the judges.\nThey added: 'In our view, the adjustment disorder had put the appellant in the state of mind to kill'. They said the 'decision to kill was probably impulsive'.\nComrades of Sergeant Blackman told last night's BBC Panorama they were glad he shot the insurgent. Sam Deen, who was on the fateful patrol, said they had all wanted to do it.\nAnother said 'everyone wanted that guy dead'.\nAfter Sgt Blackman was convicted in 2013, David Cameron described it as an 'appalling story' and said the case of a man who served six tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan 'in no way represents the incredible spirit, courage and history of the Royal Marines'.\nChancellor Philip Hammond – then defence secretary – vowed there would be no clemency.\nBut a Daily Mail investigation revealed vital evidence had been 'deliberately withheld' from the court martial.\nThe Ministry of Defence tried to sweep under the carpet an internal report that cast grave doubt on the murder conviction but it was leaked to the Daily Mail.\nAfter yesterday's victory, Theresa May told the Commons the Government respected the judgment and would examine it 'very closely'.\nConservative MP Rebecca Pow demanded the Prime Minister ensure servicemen 'be treated with fairness and understanding and given adequate resources including for mental health support' in future.\nThe MoD said: 'We respect the court's decision and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further on it.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319826/Witnesses-blocked-Marine-s-court-martial.html"}
