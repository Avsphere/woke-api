The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nA Walmart truck driver pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of vehicular homicide and assault in connection with the New Jersey highway crash that left comedian Tracy Morgan in critical condition.\nKevin Roper, 35, did not speak during the arraignment in Middlesex County before he was released on $50,000 bail he posted after his arrest.\nIn a criminal complaint, Roper was accused of operating his big rig \"recklessly\" after not sleeping for more than 24 hours, causing the early Friday pileup on the New Jersey Turnpike.\nHis truck slammed into a limo bus carrying Morgan and his entourage, police said. Morgan's mentor. James McNair, was killed. Three others, including the \"30 Rock\" star, were critically hurt.\nA Walmart spokesman has said the company believes Roper \"was operating within the federal hours of service regulations.\"\nFederal regulations limit truckers to 11 hours of driving during a 14-hour work day, with no more than 70 hours a week on the road without extra breaks. Drivers who are too sleepy to drive safely must pull over\nâ€” Tracy Connor","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/walmart-driver-kevin-roper-pleads-not-guilty-tracy-morgan-crash-n128706"}
