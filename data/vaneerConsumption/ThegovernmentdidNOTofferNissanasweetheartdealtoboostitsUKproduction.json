I don't have a cheque book,\" he said. Essentially, Clark denied that the government has offered Nissan state aid, or any kind of financial assistance.\nAs part of its review of the government's dealings with Nissan, the NAO was given a copy of Clark's letter to examine, as well as a further letter from the government, which gave \"assurances from the Permanent Secretary that there are no other letters to Nissan on this matter and that nothing was discussed in the relevant meetings that might be understood as an additional commitment by HM Government.\"\nThere is no reason those communications between government and its auditors shouldn't be released, Morse said.\nEssentially, the government has assured the NAO that it did not grant any sort of so-called \"sweetheart deal\" to the Japanese automaker before it committed to making its new models in the north-east.\nOn the day of his appearance the Treasury Committee released a letter sent by Morse to committee chair Andrew Tyrie in conjunction with his appearance.\nHere is the key extract from Morse's letter to Andrew Tyrie (emphasis ours):\n\"After a meeting in Sunderland the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy wrote to Nissan on 21 October. Nissan then announced on 27 October that they will build their new Qashqai and X-trail models in their Sunderland plant. The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy then made a statement in the House of Commons on 31 October aiming to set out the assurances government had provided. After that statement my audit team requested access to the letter the Department sent to Nissan.\n\"I have reviewed the contents of that letter. I have also received written assurances from the Permanent Secretary that there are no other letters to Nissan on this matter and that nothing was discussed in the relevant meetings that might be understood as an additional commitment by HM Government. On that basis I am satisfied there is no identifiable contingent liability for the purpose of inquiry into whether there was an obligation to notify. We will, of course, examine the evidence again during our audit of the Department's accounts.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/government-nissan-letter-should-be-released-national-audit-office-2016-12"}
