Thanks for all the messages welcoming me back.'\nAnd he had some nice words for the club he leaves behind and for the fans, he added on Twitter with a montage of pictures of Norwich promotion winning campaign last season: 'A few ups and downs... But I guess it wasn't all that bad. Thanks to all the Norwich fans giving me best wishes.'\nAs well as Afobe making his debut, Howe hopes to have international clearance for Juan Iturbe in time for the Argentinian international to face West Ham on Tuesday night.\nWest Ham boss Slaven Bilic believes Afobe will be a success at his new club — although he is well prepared to deal with him, having closely monitored the striker while he was at Wolves.\n‘I’m not going to lie but the reason we know quite a lot about him is we played Wolves in the FA Cup,’ said Bilic, whose side won 1-0 on Saturday. ‘I have no doubt he will do well, but not against us!’\nA few ups and downs...
