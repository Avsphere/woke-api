He speaks of plants, ecology,\" he said.\nDieudonne M'Bala M'Bala's company Plume Productions said he was being held with his children at the airport.\n\"He will likely be deported in the coming hours,\" it said in a statement.\nThe French consulate confirmed that Dieudonne, 49, had been held by immigration officers on his arrival.\n\"It's a question of implementing immigration laws relevant to the Hong Kong authorities,\" a consulate spokesman told AFP.\nThe consulate added that it had not asked the Hong Kong government to prevent Dieudonne entering the city.\nBut according to police sources cited by the Post, the consulate had written a letter expressing concern over the visit, warning that it could trigger \"a disturbance to public order\".\nHong Kong has a strong French community with more than 12,000 French citizens registered by the consulate as living in the city.\n- String of convictions -\nDieudonne, who made his name in a double act with Jewish comedian Elie Semoun, is infamous for his trademark \"quenelle\" hand gesture that looks like an inverted Nazi salute but which he insists is merely anti-establishment.\nFrench courts have hauled him up over a string of comments which opponents say are bluntly racist while supporters champion his right to free speech.\nA Belgian court sentenced Dieudonne to two months in jail in November for incitement to hatred over alleged racist and anti-Semitic comments he made during a show in Belgium.\nEarlier that month, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Dieudonne in a separate case, deciding that freedom of speech did not protect \"racist and anti-Semitic performances\".\nDieudonne was protesting over a fine he received from a French court in 2009 for inviting a Holocaust-denier on stage. He was fined 10,000 euros ($11,000) for what that court referred to as \"racist insults\".\nIn March, a French court also handed Dieudonne a two-month suspended sentence and fined him heavily for condoning terrorism after he caused uproar by suggesting he sympathised with the attacks against satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in Paris.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420570/French-comedian-Dieudonne-likely-deported-Hong-Kong.html"}
