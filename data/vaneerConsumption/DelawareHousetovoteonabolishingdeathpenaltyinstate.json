(AP) — The Delaware House is set to vote on a bill to abolish the death penalty in the state.\nThe bill is set to be voted on Thursday. It narrowly cleared the Senate last year but had been languishing in a House committee until the chairman agreed last week to release it.\nJudiciary Committee members voted 6-5 last May not to send the bill to the full House after it narrowly cleared the Senate on an 11-to-9 vote.\nDemocratic Gov.
