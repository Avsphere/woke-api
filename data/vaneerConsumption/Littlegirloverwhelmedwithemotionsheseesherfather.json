He released a balloon with his daughter's school from there after she began learning about the Antarctica\nShe said: 'Cherry and Alun have such a close bond, these last few months have been really hard on her.\n'She broke down a number of times at school, she really is a daddy's girl.\n'Her reaction was so emotional, there wasn't a dry eye on the playground, everybody was cheering for her.\n'It had to stop filming and get in on the cuddles, because I too couldn't hold back the tears.'\nAlun, 33, had been working at the Halley Research Base in Antarctica as an electrician since the beginning of November 2016, spending his first Christmas away from the family.\nCherry's mother Haley said the pair have a very close bond and she is a 'daddy's girl' so the four months without him had been particularly hard on her\nThe couple have three children together, aged between three and 11 and he told the Eastern Daily Press the separation was difficult but it was a once in a lifetime experience.\nHe told the paper: 'At the interview in Cambridge I thought there was no way Iâ€™d get it. Everyone seemed very academic and spoke so well, but a week after the interview I got the job offer.\n'They all [his family] really pushed me to go for it which, obviously, was the decider in me applying.\n'[My wife] is still glad I came for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.'\nHaley said: 'It means everything to have Alun back with us again, we're a very close family who do everything together.\n'Before this we'd never spent more than two weeks apart in 13 years together.\n'It felt amazing to cuddle up together as a five again.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319376/Little-girl-overwhelmed-emotion-sees-father.html"}
