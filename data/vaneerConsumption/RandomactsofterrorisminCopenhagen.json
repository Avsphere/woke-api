(snip)\nSaturday’s attack on an art cafe holding a free speech event has eerie parallels to a foiled 2010 plot to attack Jyllands-Posten, the Danish publication that was first in the world to publish images of the prophet Muhammad in 2005, to widespread revulsion among Muslims.\nIn December 2010, four heavily armed men were arrested while planning to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten in Copenhagen’s City Hall Square.\nA terrorism research, Magnus Ranstrop, offered this thought at the time of the Charlie Hedbo massacre: “This attack could just as easily have happened in Denmark.”","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/02/random_acts_of_terrorism_in_copenhagen.html"}
