The United States and Britain profited from Israel's superb intelligence abilities and saw everything that Israel saw.\"\nIsrael's foreign ministry declined to comment but Yuval Steinitz, minister of energy and a former intelligence minister, said he was disappointed.\n\"We are not surprised. We know that the Americans spy on everyone including us, their friends,\" he told Israeli army radio.\n\"It's disappointing nonetheless because of the fact that for decades we haven't spied or gathered intelligence or broken codes in the United States.\"\nAfter the 1985 arrest in Washington of US Navy intelligence analyst Jonathan Pollard, for passing US secrets to Israel, the Jewish state pledged never to spy on its ally again.\nYediot quoted an unnamed senior Israeli intelligence official describing the latest report as \"an earthquake.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3422693/US-UK-hacked-Israeli-air-surveillance-report.html"}
