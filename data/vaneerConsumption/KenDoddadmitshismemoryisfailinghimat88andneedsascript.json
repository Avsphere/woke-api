But as a comic you can get out of it with a line like \"I have had amnesia ever since I can remember\" or \"I have just bought this book on how to develop a super memory but I can't remember where I put it\".\n'So what you have to do is have a script.

I won't tell them on stage as when you are on stage you may have delicate flowers in the audience.

So your common sense tells you not to say anything mucky.\n'There are giggles, titters and woofers. If you get a woofer you are doing well. There is always a little imp inside you saying 'Go on tell it' but I don't.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3420252/I-need-script-s-no-joke-Ken-Dodd-admits-memory-failing-88-uses-one-liners-t-remember-say-stage.html"}
