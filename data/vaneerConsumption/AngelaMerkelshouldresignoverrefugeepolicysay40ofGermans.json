Arrest! The criminal chancellor', and 'Mama Multicultural'\nThe agreement means citizens of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia will have little chance of gaining political asylum, echoing steps Germany took for several Balkans countries last year.\nGermany will also block family reunifications for two years for rejected asylum seekers who can't be deported because they face the threat of torture or the death penalty in their own country.\nMerkel's cabinet should sign off on the measures next week before parliament passes them into law, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said Friday.\nA saving grace for Merkel has been the harsh weather sweeping in over Germany in recent weeks, which has been reported as a major factor in the drop in the number of migrants arriving\n'Perhaps the weather was particularly bad this year, the meteorologists will tell us one day,' said Merkel's migrant policy coordinator Peter Altmaier.\n'But above all, we must seize the window of opportunity that has opened ... Our goal must be for refugees numbers not to rise again after the end of the winter storms but for them to keep going down.'\nMerkel has refused to set an upper limit for refugee numbers or to close German borders - but she has promised a 'tangible reduction' of arrivals.\nBad results: Another poll released on Friday showed support for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc at just 37 per cent, a drop from 42 per cent in September\nKey planks of her policy involve EU and international cooperation - from spreading refugees more equitably across the EU via 'hotspot' first-registration centres, to better guarding the bloc's outside borders, to striking a deal with Turkey to limit migrant flows from Syria, Iraq and beyond.\nSo far, there has been little progress, an issue that was set to dominate Merkel's working lunch with Italian prime minister Renzi.\nGermany has voiced impatience with Italy for so far failing to set up a hotspot.\nRenzi's government has also held up a three-billion-euro ($3.3-billion) EU payment to Turkey meant to help the transit country seal its borders and house even more refugees.\nThe Italian leader has in recent months frequently criticised Berlin and Brussels over migrant policies and pushed a more assertive role for his country.\n'We are doing our part by rescuing, almost every day, children from capsized boats in the Mediterranean,' he said in comments published Thursday.\nRenzi has also demanded an end to EU rules that require refugees to apply for asylum in the first member country they enter.\nNearly 4,000 people died trying to reach Europe by sea last year, and 31 more deaths were reported Thursday.\nGreek rescuers found 25 bodies, while the Italian navy recovered six bodies off Libya, and in Bulgaria the frozen bodies of two men were found near the Serbian border.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422382/Forty-percent-Germans-say-Merkel-resign-refugee-policy-poll.html"}
