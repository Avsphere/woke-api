However, in the months since there has been little progress in amending the constitution.\nThe Madhesi groups oppose the constitution adopted in 2015, saying they should be given more territory in new federal states then was assigned to them.\nProtests in 2015 left more than 50 people dead in south Nepal.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4318792/Ethnic-group-says-pulls-support-Nepal-government.html"}
