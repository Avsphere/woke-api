Simpson has it\nDr Omalu explained that Simpson (left in 2013, right in 1967) is at a higher risk of the condition because of his large head, so big he required specially-designed helmets, which would have increased the force of impacts\nHe added: 'If you have a bigger head that means your head is heavier. That means the momentum of your impact would be bigger. It's basic physics.'\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a condition which occurs in the brains of sports stars who regularly suffered head trauma and concussions during their careers.\nThe condition, which can begin months, years, or even decades after the last trauma, causes tissue in the brain to break down, leading to impaired judgment, impulse control problems, and aggression.\nIn extreme cases it can cause memory loss, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia.\nWhile doctors were previously aware of the condition in boxers, where it was known as dementia pugilistica, Dr Omalu's research was the first to link it to football players.\nDr Omalu, whose research in 2005 inspired the Will Smith movie Concussion (pictured together this month), said the condition can cause mood swings, aggression and impaired judgement\nSimpson was notoriously accused of killing ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her rumored boyfriend Ron Goldman in 1994 in a fit of jealous rage\nDr Omalu discovered the condition after performing a privately-funded autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster who died suddenly after years of mental health problems.\nSimpson was notoriously accused of killing ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and rumored new boyfriend Ron Goldman in a fit of jealous rage in 1994.\nHe was arrested after leading police on an infamous slow-speed car cash around California then acquitted of the killing at trial.\nWHAT IS CTE? Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a degenerative brain condition caused by repeated concussion or heavy blows to the head associated with football. While a similar condition, dementia pugilistica, was know to exist in boxers, Dr Omalu was the first to identify it in footballers in a 2005 paper. The condition, which may begin months, years or even decades after the trauma occurred, causes brain tissue to break down and a particular protein called tau to build up. This leads to irrational behavior, aggression, memory loss, confusion, depression and dementia among sufferers. Because CTE is identified by dissecting the brain, sufferers can only be positively diagnosed after death - diagnosis during life is based on studying symptoms.\nSimpson was again arrested for armed robbery in 2007 and this time convicted, before being sent to jail for 33 years, though he will be eligible for parole in 2017.\nIn 2012, Simpson's attorneys attempted to appeal his sentence on the basis of diminished responsibility due to brain injury.\nAs part of their evidence, attorneys put forward testimony from Simpson in which he claimed to have suffered numerous blows to the head during his career as a running back in the NFL and at USC.\nHe said he had been sidelined after suffering severe blows to the head, and other times had continued playing despite being injured.\nWhile the evidence was never presented in court, it holds true for some of those close to Simpson.\nNorman Pardo, a former business partner of Simpson's, said: 'Everybody who knows him knows there's a problem there. There's something wrong with his head and there has been for a long time.'\nBecause of the nature of CTE it can only be diagnosed after death and as such it is impossible to say definitively whether Simpson has it.\nDr Omalu said that CTE alone would not explain Simpson's actions, but legal experts added that it could have led to a reduced sentence.\nTyler Sash, 27, a former New York Giants player who died of an accidental pain medication overdose in September 2015, was shown to have been suffering from the condition this week.\nSimpson was acquitted of their murders, but later convicted of armed burglary in 2008. While Dr Omalu says CTE would not have excused his actions, legal experts say it could have diminished his sentence\nFamily members who had noticed Sash suffering from confusion, memory loss and temper fits following at least five serious concussions on the field, donated his body for testing after he died.\nResearchers from Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation announced on Wednesday that his brain tissue displayed signs of CTE.\nNews of Sash suffering from the condition came as the NFL released figures today showing a sharp spike in concussions during the 2015 season.\nIn total teams diagnosed 279 concussions during practice matches, preseason games, and regular season matches.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423360/I-bet-medical-license-O-J-Simpson-CTE-Concussion-doctor-discovered-brain-condition-speaks-former-footballer-s-mental-health.html"}
