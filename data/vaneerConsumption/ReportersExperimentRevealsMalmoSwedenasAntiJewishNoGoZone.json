Even when I didn’t feel afraid I was made to feel different and unwelcome.”\nAccording to The Algemeiner, he “received direct threats as he walked through the city.”\nEquipped with a hidden camera and microphone, Lindgren documented his activities. One man who saw what he was wearing called him a “Jewish shit” and demanded he leave immediately. Another yelled, “Satan Jew” at him as he harmlessly walked around the city.\nThe Algemeiner also reports that as Lindgren walked into the city’s Muslim areas, the threats increased to the point where swarms of gangs would confront him.\nThe social experiment was documented in “Jew-Hatred in Malmo,” an hour-long segment uploaded to YouTube.\nThe report stated that the remaining few within Malmo’s dwindling Jewish community “are afraid to leave their homes; many want to leave the city and do not want their children to grow up there.”\nIn 2013, another journalist, The Local’s Patrick Riley, repeated a similar experiment. He reported that throughout his short journey as a “Jew,” several had stared at him with “disbelief and menace,” and that he often feared for his safety.\nIslamic anti-Semitism remains a widespread problem throughout Europe, leaving many within the continent’s Jewish population to flee for Israel. Following the French Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket killings, a Swedish-Jewish leader told The Local that she received a plethora of “emails and letters from Islamists containing threats.” She told AFP that threats against Jews have “at least doubled” in Sweden lately.\nFollow Jordan on Twitter @JordanSchachtel","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/01/23/reporters-experiment-reveals-malmo-sweden-as-a-jewish-no-go-zone/"}
