She told authorities that she believed her son ingested a drug known as “spice.” When deputies arrived, they reportedly struggled with Sherman while attempting to subdue him.\nAccording to the press release, “throughout the struggle, one of the deputies deployed a taser in an attempt to control Sherman.”\nSherman allegedly continued to resist the deputies and medical personnel. At some point, however, he stopped fighting and went into medical distress, according to the GBI. Deputies and EMS performed CPR.\nSherman was transported to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy will be performed at the GBI Medical Examiner’s Office in Decatur.\nThe GBI is also conducting an investigation into the deputies’ use of force. The findings will then be turned over to the Coweta County District Attorney’s Office for any action they deem appropriate.\n“Spice” is street slang for a type of synthetic marijuana, also sometimes known as K2. And Sherman’s is not the only Georgia death that has been linked to the drug. In 2012, “spice” was blamed in the death of a 16-year-old Fayette County resident, Chase Burnett, who ingested it before drowning in a hot tub.\nChase’s Law, legislation in Burnett’s name that Gov. Nathan Deal signed into law in April, briefly prohibited the sale of synthetic pot, but distributors have since found a way around the legislation.\n*Staff reports contributed to this article.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/coweta-man-dies-after-being-tasered-deputies/WclNwk5SBGpcf6wcCu0LjK/"}
