Furthermore, the headline turns the perpetrator into a victim by explicitly stating that the driver was shot dead by Israeli troops.\nFollowing complaints filed by media watchdog HonestReporting.com, Euronews amended its headline to read: “Israeli troops shoot dead driver who rammed car into soldiers.”\nThe amended headline still makes no mention of the driver being a terrorist.\nThe attack, which wounded the three soldiers – one of them seriously – is the first ramming attack in several weeks.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/05/09/euronews-headline-turns-palestinian-terrorist-victim/"}
