Because no one can foresee what the long-term consequences would be,” Tusk said. “As a historian I fear that Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the EU but also of western political civilisation in its entirety.”\nEveryone in the European Union would lose out economically if Britain left, Tusk said.\n“Every family knows that a divorce is traumatic for everyone. Everyone in the EU, but especially the Brits themselves, would lose out economically,” he said.\nThe latest polls show Britons are almost evenly split over whether to stay or go.\nAlthough he expressed hope that the EU would survive in the event of a Brexit, Tusk said the price would be high.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/06/13/eus-tusk-says-brexit-threaten-western-political-civilisation/"}
