More than 30 pictures showed the drill in detail with Kim roaring with laughter as he watched artillery fire.\nNorth Korea has ambitions to build a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the US mainland. Tensions have soared in recent months as it carried out a string of missile tests that sparked tit-for-tat sabre-rattling between it and Washington.\nWashington has sent the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to the Korean peninsula, where it is expected to arrive later this week for a joint naval exercise with South Korea.\nThe North has labeled the Vinson's deployment \"undisguised military blackmail\" and has threatened to \"bury it at sea\".","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4446110/N-Korea-hails-largest-firing-drill.html"}
