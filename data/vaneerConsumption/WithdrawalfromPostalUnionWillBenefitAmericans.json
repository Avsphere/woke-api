Jayme Smaldone, inventor of the Mighty Mug, a travel tumbler, discovered he could order a knockoff in China and it would be much cheaper to ship from there to his neighbor in New Jersey than to ship his own product across the street through the U.S. Postal Service.\nIn a recent op-ed for The Atlantic, Smaldone said speculation on how to brand Trump’s plan to exit the UPU – is it anti-consumer, is it anti-China – misses the mark.\n“Sometimes you see a problem that shouldn’t exist, and you simply do your best to try to fix it,” Smaldone wrote. “What the president did is good for consumers—who may not even realize they’re buying lower-quality knockoffs— good for postal ratepayers, good for the postal service, good for the country, and good for the planet if it discourages wasteful international shipping. It will also go a long way to keeping me and my 12 workers on the job.”\nGizmodo, on the other hand, complains that “those cheap Apple knockoff headphones you buy from Shenzhen are about to get more expensive.”","url":"https://spectator.org/postal-union-americans/"}
