You realize how badass that is, right?” the 47-year-old King of Queens star tweeted.\nWait, so Hillary has PNEUMONIA and she's still campaigning as hard as she is?

They've only got so much time before Trump's next gaffe. — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 11, 2016\nTrump's turned everyone with an IQ over 100 into the crazy old man at the beginning FRIDAY THE 13th. \"It's got a DEATH CURSE!\" — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 10, 2016\n\"In MY America, it'll be the kids luring clowns into woods! Believe me.\" — @realDonaldTrump , sometime in October. — Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 2, 2016\nStill, not all of Clinton’s high-profile supporters praised the candidate for campaigning with pneumonia. On Sunday, liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore urged Clinton to take a week to rest, calling the pneumonia diagnosis “serious.”\nWell, pneumonia. That's serious. Campaign kept it hidden Fri/Sat/Sun. No wonder the crazies get traction. Dems are pros at losing elections. — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) September 11, 2016\nHillary: U need to REST. Take the wk off. Take 2. Let the rest of us pull the weight. Every1 can do a little. Who's w/ me?
