He hadn't been so sick in decades, he said.\nPhotos of his arrival in the capital, Abuja, showed the lanky president smiling and walking without assistance. \"I feel much better now,\" Buhari said. \"I have rested as much as humanly possible.\"\nIn this photo released by the Nigeria State House, Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari, speaks at the presidential palace upon his arrival from medical vacation in Abuja, Nigeria, Friday, March 10, 2017.

Sahara Reporters, a New York-based Nigerian news agency, reported that Buhari indicated he would return to London for more treatments.\nFew details had been released about Buhari's medical leave in London. When he left Nigeria on Jan. 19, the government said it was for routine medical checkups and that he would return in early February.\nInstead, the 74-year-old remained out of sight for weeks while anxiety rose in Nigeria, which is grappling with crises including Boko Haram extremist attacks and an economy that last year contracted for the first time in a quarter-century.\nSome expressed anger at taxpayer-funded treatment for top officials overseas while people at home cope with poorly funded health care. \"I have received, I think, the best of treatment I could receive,\" Buhari said Friday.\nOthers in Nigeria suggested that Osinbajo, a 59-year-old lawyer and pastor who handled matters in Buhari's absence, should stay on and lead the country, one of Africa's largest economies and top oil producers\nA statement Thursday from special adviser Femi Adesina said Buhari's \"holiday\" had been extended on doctors' recommendations for further testing and rest. It gave no details about the health of the president.\nThe statement also said Buhari expressed appreciation for Nigerians who have \"prayed fervently\" for him during his absence.\nAdesina said Friday that Buhari and Osinbajo would \"continue to do the job together,\" and he criticized some in Nigeria for causing \"mischief\" during the president's absence.\nThe adviser said Buhari on Monday would send a letter to the National Assembly making his return to work \"formal and constitutional.\"\nDuring his long absence, Buhari spoke once by phone with President Donald Trump as the new U.S. leader reached out to a couple of Africa's largest economies.\nIn this photo released by the Nigeria State House, Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari, right, is welcomed by Nigeria Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, left, upon arrival from his medical vacation in Abuja, Nigeria.
