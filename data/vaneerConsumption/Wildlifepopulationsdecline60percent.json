And populations in the tropics, specifically in South and Central America, have suffered an 89 percent decline.\nExtinction risks are also up for birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and cycads, “indicating that species are moving towards extinction more rapidly.”\nThe top threats identified in the report — habitat loss, degradation and overexploitation of wildlife — are directly linked to human activities, according to WWF.\n» RELATED: Climate change will internally displace 143 million people by 2050, scientists warn\n“Current analysis suggests that humans have already pushed four planetary boundaries beyond the limit of a safe operating space,” researchers wrote. “Nature and different ecosystem services provide us with the food we eat, the water we drink and use for our societies and industries, the clean air we breathe and yet, we are pushing nature to the brink.”\nThe WWF notes that almost 20 percent of the Amazon has disappeared in 50 years, and 90 percent of the world’s seabirds likely have fragments of plastic in their stomach. Compare that to 5 percent in 1960.\n» RELATED: More than half of Americans don't think climate change will affect them\nGlobal temperatures, too, have risen at 170 times the background rate in the last 50 years. The planet has lost about half of its shallow water corals int he past 30 years. At this rate, WWF warns that less than 10 percent of the planet’s land will be free of human impact by 2050.\n“This report sounds a warning shot across our bow. Natural systems essential to our survival – forests, oceans, and rivers – remain in decline. Wildlife around the world continue to dwindle,” WWF-US president and CEO Carter Roberts said in a news release. “It reminds us we need to change course. It’s time to balance our consumption with the needs of nature, and to protect the only planet that is our home.”\nWWF researchers call for world leaders to come together on climate, biodiversity and sustainable development and to deliver “a comprehensive frame work agreement for nature and people” under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the only international legal instrument explicitly focused on protecting the planet.\n» RELATED: Climate change is turning nearly all of these baby sea turtles female — Here’s why\n“A set of collective actions are needed, together with a roadmap for targets, indicators and metrics for reversing nature loss, including for example, scenarios for land use change, dietary shifts, sustainable harvesting as well as traditional conservation approaches such as protected areas,” they wrote.\nThe WWF research follows the recent dire United Nations climate report warning humans have 12 years to act on climate change.\nDownload the Living Planet Report at worldwildlife.org.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/world/global-wildlife-populations-have-declined-percent-since-1970-wwf-warns/HEJYyRn6ojVYahleb6aOsN/"}
