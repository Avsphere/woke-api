To learn more and subscribe, please click here.\nVolkswagen recently acquired PayByPhone, a Canadian mobile payments company, for an undisclosed amount, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nPayByPhone allows customers to use mobile apps, as well as calls and texts, to pay for parking spaces in select cities, including Boston, San Francisco, and London. The firm counts 12.5 million users and processes over $300 million in volume annually. Acquiring PayByPhone could help Volkswagen become more of a mobility company in addition to an auto manufacturer, according to Engadget.\nThe acquisition could give Volkswagen access to key technology as demand for in-car payment capabilities is poised to rise. Connected cars are becoming more popular. BI Intelligence expects that 381 million connected cars will be on the road in 2021, up from 34 million in 2021. That could bring about demand for in-car payments, where customers use their car's infotainment center or an affiliated mobile app to pay for a variety of goods or services — 20% of executives, for example, believe that people will pay for things through their cars within two years.\nPayByPhone's technology, which leverages existing mobile apps, could be something Volkswagen ultimately incorporates into its vehicles. Right now, PayByPhone is focused on parking payments — something that's logical to incorporate into the car, because of the convenience that it could provide drivers. But the company's head believes that parking is a \"gateway\" to other payment providers, according to PayByPhone. That means that it's possible that Volkswagen and PayByPhone could work to attract other partners, like gas stations or restaurants, in order to broaden the use cases for in-car payments and best serve the needs of their customers.\nAnd in addition to helping the firm capitalize on pent up consumer demand, it could also help Volkswagen stay competitive as rival carmakers also pursue payments opportunities — for example, General Motors recently partnered with MasterCard to allow OnStar users to make payments.\nOver the past year, there has been a significant uptick in the number of connected cars on the road. And as internet integration becomes more commonplace, the automobile as we know it will transform.\nOver the next five to 10 years, this internet integration is expected to change the car ownership model, create a new platform for consumers to access content, lead to fully autonomous vehicles, and revolutionize the auto industry.\nThe market position of the car today is similar to where the smartphone was in 2010 — it's just taken off and is ready to explode.\nBI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the transformation of the automobile that examines the transformation of the automobile. It also analyzes all areas of the changing automotive market, including the market size for connected cars, automakers benefits and connection strategies, market leaders, consumer demand, and more.\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\nOver 380 million connected cars will be on the road by 2021. The market has seen a significant increase in automakers plans to connect the majority of the vehicles they sell and as a result, we've increased our 2015 forecast.\nAutomakers are connecting the vehicles they sell because the connection offers clear business opportunities.\nConsumers are adopting the connected car faster than expected. We identify the 3 factors that causing the increase in demand.\nTech companies will play a major role in the future of the automotive market. The big question is whether tech companies will eventually manufacture cars?\nFully autonomous cars are only a few years away. Technological, regulatory, and consumer adoption hurdles still remain, but there have been many strides towards a car that can drive itself from point A to point B with little to no human interaction.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/volkswagen-is-moving-toward-in-car-payments-2016-12"}
