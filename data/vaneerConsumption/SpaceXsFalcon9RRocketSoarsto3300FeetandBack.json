The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nSpaceX has pushed its new reusable rocket prototype to record heights, just a few short weeks after the vehicle's maiden flight.\nA spectacular new SpaceX video shows the company's Falcon 9 Reusable rocket (Falcon 9R for short) soaring to 3,300 feet (1,000 meters), about four times as high as the rocket went during its first flight test last month.\nThe stunning footage, which was released on Friday, was captured by a flying drone, providing a bird's-eye view of the action. The video shows the Falcon 9R taking off from SpaceX's rocket-development facility in McGregor, Texas, scaring some nearby cows and then touching down as planned back at the pad about two minutes after launch.\nDuring the May 1 test flight, the Falcon 9R took off with its landing legs extended. In future tests of the rocket, the legs will lie against the side of the rocket initially, then deploy in time for landing, SpaceX representatives have said.\nSpaceX is developing reusable rockets in an attempt to dramatically reduce the costs of launching satellites and people into space. Fully and rapidly reusable launch vehicles could make spaceflight 100 times cheaper, company founder and CEO Elon Musk has said.\nSuch rockets could therefore help make a Mars colony much more feasible â€” a big priority for Musk, who has said that he started SpaceX primarily to make humanity a multiplanet species.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/spacexs-falcon-9r-rocket-soars-3-300-feet-back-n97771"}
