Madtony, Leeds.\nAs I’ve said before, I don’t do requests. But, if I did, it would be this, because it doesn’t sound like Fleetwood Mac, it’s utterly deranged, not at all commercial and it turns out Stevie Nicks really knows how to twirl a baton. Have a gander. Five points next.\nPoint one: another game ‘ruined’.\nThe referee decided, and completely ruined, a really high quality, tight game. The ‘man of the match’ N’Golo Kante hardly had a kick of the ball when Manchester United had 11 on the pitch. Ander Herrera was bossing the game in the middle, then he committed two innocuous fouls and got two yellow cards. Michael Oliver reacted to the foul that Phil Jones committed a few minutes before, so I have no idea what that had to do with Herrera. Referees are deciding games. As well as Barcelona played against Paris Saint-Germain, the fact is Luis Suarez should have been sent off with a second yellow for diving to get a penalty, which instead altered the game. Sooty Dog Snipes, Lytham.\nIf Marcos Rojo is not banned for five games, we have proof of Football Association bias in Manchester United’s favour. Iron Born, Newham.\nLet me start by saying I agree over Suarez. The simulation was, however, very hard to call in real time and could only be remedied and justice done by using video technology to check after the play had stopped. It is very harsh to say the referee ‘decided’ that game – he was merely fooled, as many of us would have been given one sight of the incident. Blame Suarez, not the official.\nAs for Oliver’s performance in the match between Chelsea and Manchester United, I thought the decision to dismiss Herrera made perfect sense. Oliver thought United were deliberately and repeatedly targeting Eden Hazard, as did a great many observers. Herrera was on a booking – which I thought harsh but admit I am in the minority, including the professionals, so may have been generous – and Oliver had just called over Jones, and his captain Chris Smalling, to tell them this would not be allowed to continue. If Herrera did not get the message, he was the only one in the stadium unaware.\nMichael Oliver dismissed Ander Herrera (2nd right) at Stamford Bridge on Monday\nAs such, to blatantly trip Hazard as soon as play restarted, was as flagrant a challenge to the authority of an official as I have seen. We can argue that the two offences, viewed in isolation, did not amount to a red card – but that removes context, which in this instance is everything. At that point, Oliver had to show who was in charge by showing the promised yellow card. It is Herrera’s foolishness that, for him, this amounted to a red. For such an intelligent player, one capable of playing Kante out of the game according to you, it was a match-defining mistake. Although it is worth pointing out that Herrera is yet to finish on the winning side against Kante in English football: two defeats and a draw.\nOn the topic of Rojo’s stamp on Hazard, I think having taken such a bold stance on Tyrone Mings, the FA know they are vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy. That is why, announcing that they had let Rojo off, they hit Manchester United with a trumped-up charge of failing to control their players. The timing and juxtaposition of the Mings and Rojo incidents could not have been worse.\nPoint two: about Paul Pogba.\nWhat is happening with Pogba is becoming a serious question. People are under a strange delusion that this guy will come good. What on earth are the media and pundits seeing, and why does he get a free pass game after game? I’ve watched him for several months now and even if he improved 100 per cent he’s still not good enough. He trots around the pitch aimlessly like a lost child, has no aerial ability for a man of his size, no ball control, no vision, his first touch is deplorable and his desire and commitment non-existent. These are just the basics. I’m not detracting from Kante’s goal but he didn’t even try to get a block in – then he could be seen laughing and joking with the Chelsea players straight after the final whistle. He’s football’s biggest fraud and its time the world realised it. We’ve been had by social media hype and gimmicks. Finn05, Belfast.\nYes, but apart from that Mrs Lincoln, what did you think of the play? That’s some roll call of failure you’ve got there, Finn. I don’t think he’s been as bad as you suggest, but he’s certainly been disappointing – even for half the £89m. A couple of points in his defence, however. In some games it hasn’t looked to me that he hasn’t been trying, more that he’s trying too hard. Against Bournemouth, for instance, when Manchester United were searching for that winner against 10 men – the whole team seemed frantic in front of goal. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve seen Pogba snatch at the ball in situations, when a player of his quality should be cool. For all the bravado, the social media presence, the emojis, the new haircuts, he must know: his performances have been below what is expected of an £89m signing.\nPaul Pogba hasn't lived up to his billing as the most expensive player in the world\nManchester United’s league position is also below what was expected, given the investment in building a team for Jose Mourinho. Pogba would not be human if he did not feel the eyes of the world on him, and this could in part explain his struggles. Equally, he wouldn’t be the first great player to come to England and have a difficult first season.\nWe think he knows our game because of his first spell at Manchester United, but in reality that only amounted to seven substitute appearances. We might as well say a player who has faced English opposition in Europe has experience of the proverbial wet Wednesday in Stoke.\nNever forget that Chelsea recruited Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko because two major signings, Michael Essien and Didier Drogba, were considered disappointing in their first seasons. They were different players the next year, however. Jaap Stam was another who grew into the English game. I know others, such as Suarez, Kante or Alexis Sanchez, hit the ground running, but I wouldn’t give up on Pogba yet. He could maybe do with downplaying Brand Pogba for a while, because that only increases the pressure while his form is poor, but I still think he will come good.\nPoint three: about Stan Kroenke, Arsene Wenger and the future of Arsenal.\nSo much drama. If you think a club with a £350m turnover is just sitting there doing nothing then you’re simple. Why do you insist on Arsenal making private discussions public? Cup o Tea, London.\nKroenke's not getting involved because he’s allowing Wenger to kill his own reputation to the point where his position becomes untenable. Kroenke knows that the Arsenal fans are pretty much split on Wenger so if the owner stays out of the debate and simply allows Wenger to leave in the summer then he can’t be blamed for getting rid of him. Rots, Northampton.\nKroenke will want Wenger to extend because his policies generate profits without much investment. By completing the minimum expectations, Wenger, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and Kroenke don’t really care about the fans as long as the money keeps flowing. Sidd7689, Bangalore.\nWhen Wenger does leave and all the tributes start pouring in I hope at least one writer will point out that a big negative should go against him: namely, making the top four more important than winning a trophy. For that alone he deserves contempt, as would anyone who tries to take away the glory from football. Yes, in his early years he was a success, but that was with an inherited back four. Bertie Baiter, United Kingdom.\nArsene Wenger isn't exactly sitting comfortably in the Arsenal hotseat\nInteresting point that, Bertie. I suppose the counter argument is that Wenger has won the FA Cup more times than any other manager, with the exception of George Ramsay at Aston Villa who also has six – albeit between 1887 and 1920 – so it is hard to argue he does not value trophies. He has won the competition twice in three years and is in this season’s semi-final, too. It’s the grandest prizes that of late seem to elude him – European trophies and the domestic league – and I can see why his insistence that Champions League qualification is like a trophy in itself would irk some people.\nSimilarly, Sam Allardyce is associated with the idea that 15th place should be prioritised over cups. In defence of both men, they are probably responding to pressure from above. Wenger knows how important that top-four position is to Arsenal, Allardyce understands that most owners would rather maintain a healthy revenue stream than indulge one season of glory. The mistake is expecting supporters to think like accountants as well – although, sadly, many now do.\nI am perplexed at the way Arsenal are drifting but I still don’t think Kroenke would deliberately let the club stagnate as a means of firing Wenger. He must know by now that it would not be the unpopular call it might have been in previous years. And my point isn’t for the club to conduct private business in public, more that they should have been aware that several major decisions were scheduled to come to a head at the same time, and planned accordingly. That is where Kroenke stands accused: how can it be that Arsenal’s fans, and therefore one presumes the players, and any transfer targets, do not know what is happening with Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and the manager? Faced with such a vacuum, there is obvious speculation that two of the three – and maybe all three – will leave, and that is harmful. This has had a knock-on effect and in recent weeks we have seen speculation around David Ospina, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere. This may not have happened if the way forward was clear.\nPoint four: about the Footballer of the Year.\nI agree that Kante should be Footballer of the Year but your logic for arguing that it shouldn’t be Eden Hazard is absolutely ridiculous. Why are you comparing last season to this season? It's Footballer of the Year, which only takes into account one season at a time. The fact that Hazard was invisible last year has no bearing on whether or not he deserves to win this year, and rightly so. Riyad Mahrez was a virtual unknown the season before last but I’m sure you won’t question that he deserved to win Players’ Player of the Year in 2016. Past form and performances have no impact. The award isn't called \"Player of the Last Few Years’. Joe Hartless, Vancouver.\nLet’s get this right. There are two awards and you seem to have them confused. Player of the Year, which Mahrez won, is given by the Professional Footballers’ Association and takes place relatively early in the season. It started in 1973-74. The Footballer of the Year Award, given by the Football Writers’ Association, has the grander history and dates back to 1947-48.\nEden Hazard has had a superb season but he shouldn't be crowned Footballer of the Year\nAs I explained in the column – maybe you skipped that bit – it is not just about having a good season. The award was the brainchild of the great Charlie Buchan, as was the criteria: ‘the professional player who by precept and example is considered by a ballot of members to be the Footballer of the Year.’ That was why, as I said, some still see it as more than simply a matter of form – which is why Hazard’s mysterious disappearance from the fray last season does matter. For the same reason, even if Leicester reached the Champions League final, some would find it hard to crown Jamie Vardy again, given his performances under Claudio Ranieri in this campaign. I would concede that, of late, many FWA members no longer feel the winner should display exemplary behaviour – Luis Suarez won in 2014, and Vardy hasn’t always been a model citizen either – but some still do, which is why Hazard might not be judged solely on his displays since August.\nPoint five: no one likes them, they don’t care (and it’s not who you think).\nHow jammy are Leicester? Easiest Champions League group to qualify from, easiest opposition in the last 16, Vardy should have been sent off, a goal off a fat defender’s thigh, stupidity by Samir Nasri and Steven N’Zonzi taking one of the worst penalties of the season. And they think they are going to win the Champions League. Make the most of it. They’ll soon be out and probably relegated next season with the manager they have now. Bigaal, Bristol.\nWes Morgan (2nd left) helped Leicester reach the last eight of the Champions League\nAnd this isn’t an isolated post. Outside Leicester – where the fans have embraced the board’s ruthlessness and bought the players’ excuses and pleas of innocence – there is a good deal of animosity towards the club that, briefly, seemed to belong to everybody. I didn’t like what happened to Ranieri, either, and the players must accept part of the responsibility, but we cannot begin every mention of Leicester with caveats about duplicity. The performance against Sevilla was excellent, and far from being the weakest last 16 team the Spaniards hadn’t lost a European knockout tie since August 2011. I agree with Graeme Souness that if the players have dipped once they may do so again, and it will be interesting to see how Craig Shakespeare fares with them next season, but for now they are riding the same waves of adrenalin and motivation that made them title winners last season, so the threat of relegation is as good as gone, and Europe contains endless possibilities. Here’s one for Leicester fans, and the answer will reveal how they view their club. On Tuesday night, did they want to draw one of the elite of Europe, such as Barcelona, for the experience – even though they probably won’t win; or a team they know they can beat – such as Manchester City, even though it would have turned a Champions League quarter-final into a familiar, Premier League fixture? Do they want the romance, or are they in it to win it? Anyway, chew on that and I’ll leave you with the late, great Joni Sledge on lead vocals. A sad loss. Until next time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4319244/Paul-Pogba-come-good-Man-United-MARTIN-SAMUEL.html"}
