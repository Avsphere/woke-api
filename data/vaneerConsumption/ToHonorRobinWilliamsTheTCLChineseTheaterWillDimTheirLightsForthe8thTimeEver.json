Quite honestly, I'm still reeling along with the rest of the world from the loss of this prodigious comedic and dramatic talent. The actor/comedian that rambled and wisecracked his way into our hearts will receive a momentous tribute from the Hollywood community tonight. In honor of the life and prolific career of Robin Williams, the TCL Chinese Theater will dim their lights on Tuesday night at 8:30, according to NBC Los Angeles. In the 87-year history of the Hollywood Institution, formerly named Grauman's Chinese Theater, there have been only 7 other times that this has happened.\nWilliams was found unconscious on Monday in his Marin County apartment, and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter when authorities investigated the scene. On Tuesday it was ruled that his cause of death was asphyxia, due to a suicide by hanging. Williams was just 63, but has famously struggled with addiction and depression. He checked himself into rehab back in July to maintain his sobriety. Tributes from the entertainment community, the President, the media, and the world at large have inundated the internet, showing a tremendous outpouring of love and reverence for Williams, as well as support and sympathy for his family. To honor Williams' memory, TCL Theater forecourt, which has memorialized Williams' handprints and those of so many other industry greats, will go dark tonight for 60 seconds.\nWhile this dimming of the lights is typically reserved for the loss of American icons in show business, there have been a few exceptions to this rule. In the near-century life of the TCL Chinese Theater, here are the 7 other times in which the forecourt lights have been dimmed in tribute.\nShirley Temple\nFrederick M.
