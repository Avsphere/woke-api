The Iran-sponsored militia is known to have ​dug a vast underground tunnel ​complex replete with war rooms, internal communication lines, ventilation systems, and even missile silos.\nIsrael ​destroyed​ a significant portion of Hamas’ previous tunnel system during Operation Protective Edge in the summer of 2014.\nOne source, a member of Hamas’ ​”​military wing,” ​​told Breitbart Jerusalem that following the operation, Hamas enlisted hundreds of ​terrorists ​in order to construct an even larger tunnel network.\nThe Hamas source claimed ​that the terrorist group has succeeded in restoring much of its former tunnel system.\nHe said the next stage involves linking tunnels in north Gaza with those under Gaza City and the south. The source conceded ​that this​ requires at least two more years of work.\nWhile Hamas’ ​claims ​could not be immediately corroborated, Jordanian and Israeli security sources said there is​evidence that Hamas is working tirelessly to build a new networks of tunnels.\nAsked for comment, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told Breitbart Jerusalem:\n“The IDF is aware of the fact that Hamas has been working to rebuild its sophisticated tunnel network within the Gaza Strip.\n“The IDF remains prepared and ready to defend Israel’s borders and its civilians, especially those living in close proximity to the Gaza Strip​,​ from any potential threat should it arise.”\nAbu Khaled, a spokesperson for Hamas’ so-called military wing, had no comment on the Breitbart Jerusalem report.\nLast week, ​the former​ head of ​IDF Southern Command Maj. Gen. Sami Turgeman told a panel at Sapir College in Sderot -​ located less than a mile from the Gaza border -​ that Hamas is working hard to rebuild its tunnel system.\n“The IDF recognizes the threats and is preparing for many different scenarios. Hamas invested a lot of time and effort into building the tunnels, but the blow it sustained was immense, because we have created deterrence.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2015/11/29/exclusive-hamas-building-sophisticated-tunnel-city-gaza/"}
