Sky News reported that one of the brothers turned up at business wearing a bulletproof vest and black combat gear. At first, staff thought he was a police officer, before he said: “Get out of here, we don’t kill civilians”.\nArmed police soon surrounded the scene, with some reports even stating a tank had turned up. The men took a hostage and had reportedly told police they were “prepared to die as martyrs”\nEarly reports scene suggested one or two people had died, but this was later denied by the office of the French prosecutor.\nAll roads leading to the building where the men are hiding have been sealed off and the police are moving media away from the scene.\nAir France confirmed a number of flights were initially directed away from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport due to proximity to the hostage situation, and the high number of security helicopters in the area.\nThe siege was brought to end a few hours later after a series of explosions and gunshots were heard. The two men were reported to have run out the building firing before they were shot down. The hostage is reported to be fine.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/01/09/paris-shooting-hostages-taken-in-car-chase/"}
