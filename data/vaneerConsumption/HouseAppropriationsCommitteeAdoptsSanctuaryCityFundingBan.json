Kevin Yoder (R-KS) was approved on a committee vote of 28-21.\n“Congress must take a strong stand against sanctuary cities that support illegal immigration by giving aid and comfort to violent felons,” Yoder said Tuesday after his amendment prohibiting federal grants for sanctuary cities was adopted.\n“Cities that refuse to comply with immigration officials and release dangerous criminals back into our communities put innocent American lives at risk. If these cities wish to continue to subvert the law they will do so without the support of American taxpayers. The heartbreaking tragedy in San Francisco was preventable and we must do everything we can to ensure that it never happens again,” he added.\nYoder was referencing the murder of Kathryn Steinle at a San Francisco pier. The suspect in the shooting death is a multiple-deportee, multiple felon illegal immigrant who was released less than three months before he allegedly shot Steinle due to San Francisco’s sanctuary policies. Steinle’s death has sparked renewed concern about sanctuary cities.\nTestifying before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday, DHS Sec. Jeh Johnson expressed opposition to making compliance with federal immigration detainers mandatory.\nThe Homeland Security appropriations bill was approved by the Appropriations Committee Tuesday on a vote of 32-17.\nIt provides $39.3 billion in discretionary funding for DHS but contains no funding to implement President Obama’s executive amnesty programs and specifically prohibits funding while the issue is in the courts.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/14/house-appropriations-committee-adopts-sanctuary-city-funding-ban/"}
