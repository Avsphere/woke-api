That means I typically don't have a hard time making up my mind about which stars should make the best-dressed list at a particular event, and which stars should try a little — or a whole, whole lot — harder next time around. Take the 2014 Oscars red carpet, for example: I decided within seconds that Cate Blanchett was divine, while Jennifer Garner left me, well, a little sad. And at the 2014 Met Gala, I had no problem proclaiming that stars like Emmy Rossum, Lily Aldridge, and Karolina Kurkova were to die for, while Katie Holmes's Beauty and the Beast dress just made me die a little inside. (And please, don't get me started on Lupita Nyong'o's confusing flapper number).\nBut the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Grants Banquet on Thursday was a different case altogether, as A-listers like Kerry Washington and Kristen Bell looked so stunning and chic, it was almost impossible to decide who was the best-dressed star of the evening. Think you could help me out? Just click through to see the looks, then decide which amazing ensemble was your favorite.","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35890-at-the-2014-hollywood-foreign-press-associations-grants-banquet-kristen-bell-kerry-washington-and-more-battle"}
