Vincent Anthony, who arrived to Atlanta from Florida in the 1960s, made it possible. He started a traveling performance team called the Vagabond Marionettes. After performing all over the Southeast, including places like the Woodruff Arts Center, Anthony found a place for his puppets to call home.\nThat home was the old Spring Street Elementary School, which was later transformed into the Center for Puppetry Arts. During its first season, the Center offered a puppet exhibition, shows and workshops for the community. Now, almost 40 years later, the Center has stayed true to its original goal of focusing on performance, education and the museum. You can read more about the Center's history on its history page.\n5 reasons to go to the Center for Puppetry Arts\nFamily Series Shows – Audiences young and old visit the Center for its variety of family-friendly shows.

Photo credit: Sara Hanna Photography (Jewel Wicker/Atlanta Life and Culture Blog)\nThe Jim Henson Collection – When the Center for Puppetry Arts first opened its doors, it was Jim Henson, with some help from his creation, Kermit the Frog, who cut the ceremonial ribbon. Now, almost 40 years later, Henson is still being honored in The Worlds of Puppetry Museum. The Jim Henson Collection is an interactive exhibition that walks visitors through the iconic locations from Henson's life and shows off his most famous puppets, including Kermit and Miss Piggy.\nThe Global Collection – Once you've viewed the Jim Henson Collection, the Museum has a separate exhibit to give visitors a taste of the different puppetry traditions from major cultures around the world. Once inside, visitors can go from continent to continent to see artifacts and get a hands-on feel of how other cultures use puppetry as a form of teaching and communicating. Highlights from this collection include pieces from “Gumby” and “The Lion King on Broadway”.\nThe Create-A-Puppet Workshop – When you buy tickets to see a Family Series show, you get access to the Create-A-Puppet Workshop where you'll get to go through the hands-on process of building your own puppet. Throughout the workshop, an instructor will guide you through interactive learning opportunities and give you the chance to put your puppet into motion on the classroom stage. Children ages four and up can participate in the workshop, but a parent is required to help children ages two and three if they want to join in the fun.\nMovies with Puppets as the Stars ­– When was the last time you saw some of your favorite Muppet films?
