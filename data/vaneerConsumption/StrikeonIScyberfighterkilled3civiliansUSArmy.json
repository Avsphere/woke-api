It has been accused of underestimating their numbers.\nAirwars, an NGO based in London, which compares and compiles publicly available information, estimates that actual civilian deaths could number in the hundreds, possibly even exceeding 1,000.\nAccording to some sources, the coalition has begun accepting a greater risk of civilian casualties when bombing attacks look likely to give the coalition a significant advantage.\nJunaid Hussain, who was killed in the August attack, used Twitter and social networks to incite IS sympathizers around the world to launch \"lone wolf\" style attacks.\nAmerican officials say he was notably implicated last spring in compiling and circulating a list of 100 American military figures to be killed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3423357/Strike-IS-cyber-fighter-killed-3-civilians-US-Army.html"}
