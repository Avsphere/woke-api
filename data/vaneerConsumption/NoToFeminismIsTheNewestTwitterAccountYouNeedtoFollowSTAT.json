For those of you who don’t know, WAF features women holding up signs explaining why they don’t need feminism…and most of them are incredibly misinformed, ignorant, and confused. With statements like “I don’t need feminism because I can own up to the mistakes I’ve made in my life and do not have to blame them on the completely fictional patriarchy” and “I don’t need feminism because I don’t have to push men down to feel equal to them,” it is clear that these women don’t understand what feminism actually is and don’t care to learn, which would be less disturbing if WAF’s Facebook group hadn’t amassed over 25,000 likes.\nUntil now, the best response to the heaping pile of misinformation that is WAF has been the Tumblr Confused Cats Against Feminism. Confused Cats Against Feminism showcases adorable cats hilariously misunderstanding feminism and confusing it with things like vacuums and tuna to satire WAF and point out its ridiculousness.\nLuckily for us, witty internet feminists are at it again with the Twitter account @NoToFeminism. The account is a truly hilarious satire of WAF and delightfully points out how foolish the Facebook group and Tumblr really are. The accounts bio is ‘lol feminism no thanks’ and the tweets feature amazingly bizarre logic, strategic spelling errors, and snarky jabs at anti-feminist logic that will bring tears of joy to your eyes.\nThe laugh out loud account has gained over 16,000 followers since August 5. We highly suggest that you join them.\nHere are some of our favorites:\nNeed any reminders on why we do need feminism? Check out how Bustle editors responded to WAF.\nImage: NoToFeminism/Twitter","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35513-notofeminism-is-the-newest-twitter-account-you-need-to-follow-stat"}
