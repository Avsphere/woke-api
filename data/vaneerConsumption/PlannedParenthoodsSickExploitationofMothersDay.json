But no, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America came out this year with four choices of Mother’s Day cards to remind people that they “care.”\nIn the true spirit of Margaret Sanger, three of the four cards depict black women.\nOne of the cards allegedly recounts the experience of a 45-year-old mother in Nairobi, who “has never used family planning, but wants her daughter to be able to use it to have more control over her future.” The message could not be more clear: “Dear daughter, don’t make the mistake I did in having you. Thanks to Planned Parenthood, you won’t have to.”\nThank you for caring for us, advocating for us, and for talking to us about the birds & the bees.

After considering her options and her circumstances, “she decided that terminating her pregnancy was the best decision for her at the time.” Later on, as a financially stable adult with a career, Shawanna became pregnant again and this time brought the child to term. The Mother’s Day message here? “Dear daughter, you should thank God every day that you won the lottery and I decided to keep you—unlike your nameless older sister whom you will never meet. Just pray the finances stay strong.”\nA third Mother’s Day card cites a woman named Chloe, oozing with gratitude for the Supreme Court’s decision to wrench abortion regulation from the democratic process and impose abortion-on-demand for the country.\nTo all who fought for our right to be moms when we’re ready: Happy #MothersDay.

Wade never gave anyone “the right to be a mom by choice.” All women already had that right, even prior to 1973. It only gave women the “right” to legally kill their unborn children with impunity.\nAnd that’s what Planned Parenthood thinks is worthy of celebrating.\nOn Mother’s Day.\nFollow Thomas D.
