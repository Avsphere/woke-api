Even more importantly, though, the spooky season is almost upon us. That’s right, grocery stores have already started lining aisle shelves with candy corn and giant bags of chocolate, which simultaneously feels like a personal attack (wasn’t it just summer yesterday?) and inspiring (wait, what Halloween costume should I wear?).\nWhile you may be looking forward to refreshing your fall wardrobe, it is truly never too early to start planning your Halloween costume. October 31st has a habit of creeping up faster than you think, and this year, why not floor your friends with a killer pun-inspired costume? It’s no secret that puns are basically one of the most polarizing concepts out there — you either groan whenever you hear one or grin from ear to ear. But I'm a firm believer that puns have unfairly bad reputations. After all, what other kind of costume lets you flex your creative muscles while also making your friends laugh (or cringe) out loud? Ahead, you’ll find 10 clever costume ideas to bring out your inner pun-enthusiast.\nParty Animal\nASOS DESIGN Curve deep bardot mini skater dress, $35.00, ASOS;\nMissguided plunge kimono sleeve jumpsuit, $40.00, ASOS;\nSeasonsTrading Bear Ears & Bow Tie Costume Set, $4.88, Amazon;\nMudder Cat Ear Headband, $6.89, Amazon\nThis is an easy one to do in a group, especially if you're feeling a little lazy. Grab your jazziest party outfit (maybe a sparkly dress or your favourite jumpsuit), an animal-ears headband, and draw on some animal-inspired make-up based on your creature of choice.\nHoly Cow!\nNothing But Love Adult Cow Kigurumi Onesie Pajamas, $19.99, Amazon;\nWhite Feather Angel Wing & Halo Set, $20.97, Amazon\nWe have cows to thank for one of the best things in this life: ice-cream. Celebrate these glorious creatures by emulating this early-2000s catchphrase: pair a comfortable cow onesie with angel wings and a halo.\nQueen Bee\nHUHOT Women's Long Sleeve Boat Neck Striped Tee Shirts, $16.88, Amazon;\nSilver Rhinestone Pointed Tiara, $7.49, Claire's;\nBee Wings with Antenna Costume Set: 2 Pc, $5.99, Amazon\nThe bumblebee, alongside the sacred last-minute cat costume, is a Halloween classic. Up the ante by adding a crown to your black-and-yellow striped look because, really, any excuse to rock a crown is generally a good idea. You can also stick \"Yoncé\" on your outfit in gold letters if you want to pay homage to the other Queen B.\nCat Burglar\nUO Oversized Striped Rugby Shirt Dress, $59.00, Urban Outfitters;\nBlack Cat Ear Headband, $1.18, Etsy;\nWhite Cotton standard pillowcases, $7.95, Amazon\nSpeaking of cats, a cat burglar costume is another easy look to put together. Pair a striped shirt or dress with cat ears and some drawn-on whiskers. Grab an old white pillow case or bag and stick a dollar sign on it to carry around as a money bag (that has the added bonus of doubling as a purse to throw your things in).\nJurassic World\nT-Rex Print Nightdress, $12.90, Forever 21;\n24x36 World Classic Wall Map Poster Paper Folded, $8.90, Amazon\nDo you love movies? Do you also love dinosaurs? Then for this low-key costume, grab a dino-inspired shirt and walk around with a paper atlas.\nDust Bunny\nEaster Bunny Set 2pc, $4.99, Party City;\nWool Shop Ostrich Feather Dusters, $13.89, Amazon\nPut on some bunny ears and grab your nearest feather duster for a easy dust bunny costume.\nSmart Cookie\nGraduation Service Unisex Matte Gown Cap Tassel, $22.05, Amazon;\nTate's Bake Shop Chocolate Chip Cookies, $4.99, Target\nDust off your old cap and gown (or buy a new one) and buy your favorite type of cookies to carry around with you. Any costume that doubles as a snack is a win-win.\nSpice Girls\nChef Designs Men's Standard Bib Apron, $5.44, Amazon\nThis is another ideal group costume outfit. Print off a label with your favorite spice and pin it to an apron to give off punny girl power vibes.\nSchoolgirl Q\nPlus Size Wrap-Front Plaid Skort, $22.90, Forever 21;\nMen's Cotton Bucket Hat, $9.95, Amazon\nPair a schoolgirl-inspired plaid skirt with a bucket hat and a marker \"Q\" tattoo on your cheek to channel the rapper ScHoolboy Q.\nPumpkin Pi\nWomen's Plus Size Meriwether Crew Neck Short Sleeve T-Shirt, $8.00, Target;\nGlitter Pumpkin Headband, $4.99, Party City;\nIf you simply can't get enough pumpkin spice in your life, draw the pi sign onto an orange t-shirt and grab a pumpkin-themed headband to sport on your head. If you're feeling particularly pumpkin-y (or just hungry), carry around a literal pumpkin pie with your look.\nThese costumes won't win any awards for subtlety, but that sounds like a bad award anyway. Embrace your most puntastic you this halloween with one of these costumes.","url":"https://www.bustle.com/p/10-punny-halloween-2018-costume-ideas-that-are-totally-not-cringeworthy-11868514"}
