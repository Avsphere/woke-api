Is there a limit, for instance, to the number of protons that can be packed into an atomic nucleus?\n\"There are predictions that super-heavy elements should exist which are very long-lived,\" Düllmann told Live Science. \"It is interesting to find out if half-lives become long again for very heavy elements, especially if very neutron-rich species are made.\"\nTypically, the more protons and neutrons are added into an atomic nucleus, the more unstable an atom becomes. Most super-heavy elements last just microseconds or nanoseconds before decaying. Yet, scientists have predicted that an \"island of stability\" exists where super-heavy elements become stable again. If such an \"island\" exists, the elements in this theoretical region of the periodic table could be extremely long-lived — capable of existing for longer than nanoseconds — which scientists could then develop for untold practical uses, the researchers said. (A half-life refers to the time it takes for half of a substance to decay.)\nDüllmann and his colleagues say their findings, published Friday (May 1) in the journal Physical Review Letters, are a step in the right direction.\nElement 117 was first reported in 2010 by a team of American and Russian scientists working together at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Since then, researchers have performed tests to confirm the existence of the elusive new element.\nA committee from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the worldwide federation charged with standardizing nomenclature in chemistry, will review the findings to decide whether to formally accept element 117 and grant it an official name.\n— Denise Chow, Live Science\nThis is a condensed version of a report from Live Science.
