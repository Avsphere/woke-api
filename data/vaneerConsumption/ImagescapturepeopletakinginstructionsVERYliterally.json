But as we can all agree, they've definitely had the last laugh.\nThis jokester at a shopping centre took this sign to its world, by actually 'falling' into the line\nOne woman responded to a Spanish sign which read - 'if you need to breastfeed, please cover yourself' - by wrapping a scarf around her own head but leaving her feeding infant in full view\nThis animal store is in fact genuinely referring to baby birds in its use of 'chicks' here, but these two girls couldn't resist a quick stunt as they shopped\nThis sign is either a slight mistranslation or an attempt at metaphorical wordplay, but at least one visitor took it literally\nA flip-flop-clad comedian who grabbed this opportunity for a joke with both arms open\nThis character poked fun at the powers-that-be when he visited an area with a sign banning a comically-long list of pastimes - by cruising through on a unicycle\nOne young woman responded to a man's request for 'a pic of you in a bra' by sending him a headshot of herself stuck to the inside of an actual bra\nIt makes sense to leave post underneath the doormat when no-one is home,but not necessarily when the box is almost the height of the door\nA sign spotted at the Kaiser Permanente healthcare clinic in Oakland, California, on which someone stuck a Post-it note reading: 'Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?'\n'It' here, obviously does not refer to the actual dog, but it certainly could be read that way\nIn both these cases, casual innuendos were met with some very literal smack-downs\nAs signs go, this is one a has a somewhat passive aggressive tone to it - seemingly rewarded here by a succession of Smart Alecs\nA slightly odd sentiment to throw into the sphere of social media, one that was tested and in this woman's case, failed\nA man performs a very literal read on a set of cooking instructions\nHe is seen ripping one of the sleeves from his jumper off and then filming it\nIce Ice Baby - courtesy of a quick-thinking rap fan outside a petrol station who happened to have a child with them\n'Please clean this bathroom tonight, clean it like the Queen of England is visiting, clean tonight', reads the sign on the left... instructions which were taken very seriously (right)\nBut what if you don't actually break the seal? A case of wriggling out of a loophole with this CD\nThe uploader of this image captioned it: 'My aunt's hand soap is way too literal and makes me uncomfortable'\nAnd this user explained: 'In his defense, I did say to put these in the bathroom.
