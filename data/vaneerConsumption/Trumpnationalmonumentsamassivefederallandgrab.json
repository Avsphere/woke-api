They said the designation will stymie growth by closing the area to new commercial and energy development. The Antiquities Act does not give the president explicit power to undo a designation and no president has ever taken such a step.\nTrump's order was one of a handful he intended to sign this week in a flurry of developments before his 100th day in office. The president has used executive orders aggressively over the past three months; as a candidate, Trump railed against Obama's use of this power.\nWednesday's order will cover several dozen monuments across the country designated since 1996. They total 100,000 acres or more and include the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Bear Ears, both in Utah.\nZinke was directed to produce an interim report in 45 days and make a recommendation on Bears Ears, and then issue a final report within 120 days.\nZinke said that over the past 20 years, the designation of tens of millions of acres as national monuments have limited the lands' use for farming, timber harvesting, mining and oil and gas exploration, and other commercial purposes.\nWhile designations have done \"a great service to the public,\" Zinke said the \"local community affected should have a voice.\"\nSome, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have hailed the order as the end of \"land grabs\" by presidents dating to Bill Clinton.\nBut Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said that if Trump truly wants to make America great again, he should use the law to protect and conserve America's public lands. In New Mexico, Obama's designation of Rio Grande del Norte National Monument and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument have preserved important lands while boosting the economy, Heinrich said, and that story has repeated across the country.\n\"If this sweeping review is an excuse to cut out the public and scale back protections, I think this president is going to find a very resistant public,\" Heinrich said.\nLeaders of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition called Trump's action \"extremely troubling.\"\n\"It is offensive for politicians to call the Bears Ears National Monument 'an abuse,'\" said Shaun Chapoose, chairman of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee. \"To the contrary, it is a fulfillment of our duty to preserve our cultures and our ancestral lands, and its designation was the result of a long, deliberative process to fight for our ancestors as well as access for contemporary use of the lands by our tribal members.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.\nPresident Donald Trump hands a pen to Sen.
