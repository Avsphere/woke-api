Executives sought to put a positive spin on the China economy.\nFILE - In this Sept. 19, 2014, file photo, the Alibaba logo is displayed during the company's IPO at the New York Stock Exchange.

We have no reason to think anything different in the foreseeable future.\"\nFor those wondering how Alibaba's results are being affected by the Chinese economy: \"I think the strong (revenue) numbers we released today speak for themselves,\" he added.\nAlibaba is benefiting from a shift to mobile spending and a growth in users. Mobile spending accounted for 65 percent of total China retail revenue, up from 30 percent last year.\nAnnual active buyers rose 22 percent to 407 million.\nBut investors were still spooked by any possible signs of weakness. Growth in gross merchandise volume, or the total value of items bought on Alibaba's Chinese retail sites, rose 23 percent, but that was slower growth than the 28 percent rise in the prior quarter.\nR.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said slowing gross merchandise volume could be a \"potential yellow flag,\" but concerns about the economy are \"largely overblown.\"\n\"Overall, we view these results as largely reinforcing a positive view of Alibaba, even in the face of a transitioning China economy,\" Sebastian said.\nThe popular Chinese shopping holiday, Nov. 11, dubbed \"Singles Day\" helped boost results as well. Alibaba saw 115 million shoppers to its marketplaces including Tmall and Taobao who spent $14 billion in gross merchandise volume.\nNet income for the three months ending Dec. 31 more than doubled to 12.5 billion Chinese yuan ($1.93 billion) or 4.90 yuan per share (76 cents) from 5.94 billion Chinese yuan.\nAdjusted for one-time costs, net income totaled 99 cents per share. Analysts expected 89 cents per share, according to FactSet.\nAlibaba Holding Ltd.'s revenue rose 32 percent to 34.54 billion Chinese yuan ($5.33 billion) from $26.18 billion last year. That beat analyst expectations of $5.11 billion.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420862/Alibaba-3Q-net-income-jumps-strong-holiday-season.html"}
