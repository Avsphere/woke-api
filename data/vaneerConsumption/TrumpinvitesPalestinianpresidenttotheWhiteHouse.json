I can live with either one,' Trump said, causing consternation across the Arab world and in many European capitals.\nThe White House has since been more cautious on the issue, and there has been less talk of moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a promise Trump made during the campaign but a move that would provoke anger across the Muslim world.\nDavid Friedman, Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel, who was approved by the Senate foreign relations committee on Thursday, has said he wants to see the embassy move to Jerusalem and expects to work from the city at least some of the time.\nWhile one of the first calls to a foreign leader made by Trump's predecessor Barack Obama was to Abbas, Trump has been cautious in his contacts with the Arab world.\nHe has spoken to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and met Jordan's King Abdullah, who took the initiative and flew to Washington for an impromptu visit.\nOne of the most heated issues between Israel and the Palestinians is Israel's building of settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory the Palestinians want for their own state along with Gaza.\nDuring the campaign, Trump said he did not necessarily see settlements as an obstacle to peace. Since his inauguration, Israel has announced plans to build at least 6,000 more settler homes, a substantial increase and an indication that Israel took Trump's softer language as a green light.\nBut during Netanyahu's visit, Trump said he wanted the Israeli prime minister to 'hold back on settlements for a little bit', a position that took Netanyahu by surprise. Israeli and U.S. officials are now discussing what the parameters are on settlements.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301096/Trump-Palestinian-President-Abbas-hold-talks.html"}
