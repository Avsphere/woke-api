It did not say how three of the men were killed.\nThe Syrian-Jordanian border is heavily guarded because of Jordanian concerns about the spillover from Syria's six-year-old civil war.\nJordan sealed the border last year, after a cross-border car bomb attack by Islamic State extremists killed seven Jordanian border guards.
