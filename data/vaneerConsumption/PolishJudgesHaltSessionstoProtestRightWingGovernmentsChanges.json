If submitted to a vote, the draft law would likely win backing as the ruling Law and Justice party has a majority. It is not clear when the vote will take place.\nThe opposition parties also criticized the government’s plans.\n“We all know that the justice system is calling for a reform, but Law and Justice just wants to raze Poland’s courts to the ground,” Kamila Gasiuk-Pihowicz of the Modern party said.\nThe move is another step in ruling party’s efforts to take control of the judiciary, which have been strongly criticized by European Union leaders.\nShortly after taking power in 2015, the party moved to appoint judges of its own choice to a top court, the Constitutional Tribunal. Law and Justice also wants to replace the head of the Supreme Court and to reorganize the work of the nation’s lower-level courts.\nThe government says the changes are need because of general dissatisfaction with the slow pace at which courts handle cases.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/04/20/polish-judges-halt-sessions-protest-right-wing-governments-changes/"}
