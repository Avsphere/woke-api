I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for them.\n'They knew what they were doing. They were in the garden watching us while we were watching television.\nThe homeowner said the men popped a window pane by the back door and hid it in bushes in the garden\n'Then they stayed hidden in the garden for an hour until they saw us go to bed and broke in about 1.30am.\n'What they did was pop a window pane by the back door and hid it in bushes in the garden and got in that way.\n'My husband had come back downstairs because he couldn't sleep so was in the lounge when he saw the torch lights and realised someone was inside.\n'But we have two giant dogs so they heard them too and charged at them straight away.\nThe homeowner was in the lounge when he saw the torch lights and realised someone was inside the house\n'They quickly ran out and luckily for them they managed to shut the back door on their way out so the dogs couldn't chase them.\n'We have got eight cameras and floodlights everywhere and there is a giant dog bed outside so it is odd that they targeted us.\n'There have been a load of burglaries nearby but ours was the first caught on camera so the police were really happy.\n'Officers came out the next night to make sure we were okay and have been door to door but nobody has been arrested yet.'\nThe family say it was odd they were targeted because they have eight cameras and floodlights everywhere\nMrs Wright said nothing had been taken by the burglars but the incident had left the whole family feeling less safe in their own home.\nShe added: 'We don't have anything of great value in the house.\n'The police said there had been other burglaries in the same area that had been committed in a similar way.'\nNorthamptonshire Police are now appealing for anyone with information about the burglary to contact them or the anonymous charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421173/Cocky-crooks-turn-security-cameras-breaking-house-family-dogs-scare-off.html"}
