He is also famous for creating the 'kipper' tie (right)\nMr Fish’s creations also made it onto screen.\nOne of the 'unsung heroes' of British fashion - Michael Fish, pictured here holding a preview of summer fashion with Janet Lyle\nHe is credited as a costume designer for Peter Sellers’ 1960s film There’s a Girl in My Soup, designed the ruffled shirts worn by Jon Pertwee when he was Doctor Who, and dressed Terence Stamp in the film Modesty Blaise.\nHe even designed the robe worn by Muhammad Ali’s Rumble in the infamous Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974.\nNow the 76-year-old designer, whose full name is Michael Fish, and his family have agreed to sell the rights to the name to menswear specialist David Mason.\nMr Fish shirts will soon be available online and in upmarket menswear shops.\nMr Mason, who has also recently revived James Bond’s tailor Anthony Sinclair, has raised £150,000 to buy the Mr Fish name and re-launch the company.\nProduction of shirts will begin within weeks, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the brand.\nThe initial launch will comprise three lines of shirts - a bespoke classic range with an orange label, a limited edition red label, and a ready to wear blue label fashion line. Prices range from £150-£250.\nMr Mason said: ‘It is difficult to think of any designer who has achieved as much in their lifetime as Michael Fish accomplished in a short period during the 1960s and 70s, yet he’s remained one of Britain’s unsung heroes.\n‘It’s a great honour and privilege to be involved in the relaunch of Mr Fish and to hopefully secure the recognition that the name deserves.’\nAt the height of his career, London-born designer Mr Fish counted the likes of Twiggy among his friends.

The designer is pictured left in 1968, and right, in 1969\nShe added: ‘Over the last two years, the men’s fashion market has expanded to such an extent that it’s growing at a faster pace than womenswear. Our exhibition explores the history of menswear – from the 19th century to the swinging sixties and the high street we know today.’\nMr Mason’s menswear business – and the new home of Mr Fish - is based at 34 Montagu Square in London, a location that has been the home of a collection of celebrities.\nJanet Lyle and Michael Fish held a preview of their summer fashions in the middle of winter\nThe property was first bought by Ringo Starr in 1965, before being rented out to Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix.\nHendrix wrote his song The Wind Cries Mary there. Later John Lennon and Yoko Ono moved in and shot their nude photographs for the cover of the Two Virgins album.\nMr Mason raised £150,000 from investors through government scheme Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme for the Mr Fish venture.\nThe scheme was launched by Chancellor George Osborne in 2011 as a way for investors to back small businesses while getting tax relief.\nAustralian Model Miranda Quarry, who was once married to actor Peter Sellers, working In Michael Fish's Boutique in Mayfair","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422402/Austin-Powers-style-fashion-make-return-launch-Mr-Fish-designs-popular-David-Bowie-Mick-Jagger.html"}
