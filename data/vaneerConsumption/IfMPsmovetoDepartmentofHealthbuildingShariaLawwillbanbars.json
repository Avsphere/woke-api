In June 2014 George Osborne announced that Britain was launching the first Islamic bond scheme in the non-Muslim world. Three Government buildings in Whitehall were transferred to Islamic bonds, switching the ownership from British taxpayers to wealthy Middle Eastern businessmen and banks. The issue of bonds raised £200million and was the first carried out by a Western country and Osborne said it would turn the UK into 'the western hub of Islamic finance' and the 'undisputed centre of the global financial system.' But critics say the scheme would waste money and could undermine Britain's financial and legal systems by imposing Sharia law onto government premises. The bonds – known as Sukuk – are only available for purchase by Islamic investors. The money raised will be repayable from 2019. But instead of interest, bond-buyers will earn rental income from the three Government offices as interest payments are banned in Sharia law. The Treasury agreed to make the sukuk fully compliant with Sharia law to ensure investors were not put off investing in the scheme, meaning each of the buildings used to finance the products must meet the terms of Sharia law, including the ban on alcohol.\nIt is the latest stumbling block encountered by Parliamentary authorities as they search for a new home while a £4billion worth of repairs is carried out on the building, which is riddled with asbestos, leaking ceilings and rodents and was described as a 'death trap' by one close to the refurbishment plans.\nA spokeswoman for the joint committee on the Palace of Westminster said: 'The committee is looking at a range of options and no final decision has been taken.\n'It is aware that Richmond House is under a bond.'\nThe Palace of Westminster has dozens of bars and restaurants, where MPs, peers, staff and other passholders can enjoy pints for as little as £2.90 - 70p cheaper than the average price of a pint in London.\nTaxpayers subsidise the sale of alcohol in Parliament to the tune of £4million a year.\nEarlier this week MPs kicked up a fuss over fears they could lose their hair salon, flower shop and car park as part of the multi-billion revamp.\nThe cheapest and quickest option for refurbishing the Palace of Westminster would require MPs to temporarily move out of the building for up to six years.\nA specially-made chamber built in the courtyard of the Department of Health – just 100 yards down the road from the Palace of Westminster – is the preferred option among MPs.\nRemaining close to the Palace of Westminster would be the most convenient option for government ministers, who would continue to work in Whitehall departments and must be held accountable to Parliament.\nAn independent report commissioned by Parliament estimated that the revamp would cost more than £7bn and take 32 years to complete if politicians did not move out of the building temporarily.\nBut the costs could be halved to an estimated £3.5billion and take just six years if MPs and peers agree to a temporary new home.\nPlans to rehouse MPs in Whitehall was discussed by Labour's Shadow Leader of the Commons at Monday's Parliamentary Labour party meeting.\nI do find it unbelievable government buildings are governed by Sharia law. Most of our constituents will be absolutely amazed that the principle could ever have been authorised Tory MP Andrew Bridgen\nMr Bryant told his colleagues that Parliament's Joint Committee on the Palace of Westminster had all but ruled out the idea of relocating MPs outside London.\nChris Grayling, the Leader of the Commons and chairs the cross-party committee overseeing the refurbishment plans, is expected to tell Tory MPs of the plans later this week.\nWhere to relocate roughly 800 peers is proving more difficult.\nSimilar courtyards in the Treasury or the Foreign and Commonwealth Office could be used as part of the refurbishment, which is expected to begin following the 2020 general election.\nMPs moved to the House of Commons during the Second World War after bombing damaged the chamber.\nMoving MPs to a courtyard in the Department of Health is popular with some MPs because it could easily be integrated into the current Parliamentary estate.\nIt is located next to 1 Parliament Street and Porcullis House, where many MPs' offices are housed, meaning MPs could go to vote in the temporary chamber without leaving the estate and avoiding security concerns.\nDepartment of Health staff would have to move out of the offices in Richmond House at 79 Whitehall while a temporary chamber is built.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422642/MPs-moved-Westminster-barred-drinking-Sharia-law.html"}
