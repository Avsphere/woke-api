Investigators said Joyner made and exploded a bottle bomb inside the Magic Johnson Movie Theatre in Largo, Md., on May 24.\nHe is officially charged with manufacture/possession/detonation of a destructive device – a felony charge. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in jail.\nAfter the arrest, ATF, FBI, Anne Arundel County Fire Marshal, Fairfax County Fire Marshal, City of Alexandria Fire Marshal and the Montgomery County Fire Marshal, executed a search warrant at a home in the 600 block of Stillwater Place in Bowie.\nMore charges against Joyner are expected, according to a release from authorities.\nInvestigators said those bottles were filled with chemicals and metal, and they consider the incidents possible acts of terrorism.\nTwo bottle bombs exploded recently at the AMC movie theater in Tysons Corner, Va. There have been no injuries in any of the cases.\nThe Associated Press reports online court records show Joyner pleaded guilty in late 2012 to malicious destruction of property and was given probation before judgment. A person who answered the phone at Joyner's home on Sunday said she was unaware of the arrest and did not say whether he had an attorney.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/arrest-made-bottle-bomb-explosion-d-c--area-theater-n119741"}
