It also sits lower to the ground.\nThere will be a plug-in hybrid version — the first in the industry — that can go up to 30 miles on electric power alone before the gas engine kicks in.\nOther firsts include hands-free sliding doors that open when the driver sticks a foot under them.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3393376/With-SUV-look-tech-touches-Chrysler-aims-revive-minivan.html"}
