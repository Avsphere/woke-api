Both Senators and Congressmen voted Wednesday in favor of overriding the president’s move. The vote passed the bill as a statute, marking the first time Congress has quashed a veto during Obama’s two terms in office.\nThe GCC, a six-member coalition of Gulf Arab states that includes Saudi Arabia, expressed concern when the U.S. Congress passed the bill earlier this month. Saudi Arabia, a longstanding ally of the United States, has been described as the GCC’s most powerful member.\nIn a statement issued September 12, Abdullatif al-Zayani, secretary general of the GCC, said the law “contravenes the foundations and principles of relations between states, notably sovereign immunity,” adding that it “will create a grave precedent.”\n“This should be clear to America and to the rest of the world: When one GCC state is targeted unfairly, the others stand around it,” Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, an Emirati Gulf specialist and professor of political science at United Arab Emirates University, told AP after the U.S. senate’s veto override Wednesday.\n“All the states will stand by Saudi Arabia in every way possible,” he also said.\nAbdullah noted that if the bill is enacted into law, he expects the GCC will take action that is more assertive and independent of the U.S. in places like Yemen, Bahrain and Egypt.\n“This is not just a threat. This is a reality,” he declared.\nOf the 19 al Qaeda plane hijackers who carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on U.S. soil, 15 called Saudi Arabia home.\nIn an op-ed that was first published on the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al–Awsat, Abdulrahman al-Rashed, the former general manager of the kingdom’s Al Arabiya News Channel, wrote of the bills passage by the U.S. congress:","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/28/saudis-allies-warn-us-retaliation-911-bill/"}
