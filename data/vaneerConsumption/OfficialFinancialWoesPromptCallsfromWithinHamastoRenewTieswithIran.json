Another detrimental factor is the schism between Hamas and its allies in the Islamic State branch in Sinai following pressure from Cairo.\nThe official said that despite the crisis the movement’s financial standing is solid, “but it’s far from being what it was when Iran supported us completely.”\nIn light of the crisis, some members have called for rapprochement with Iran. “And there are calls to renew ties with Iran after the election of a new diplomatic team at the end of March or beginning of April,” he said.\nHe added that last week Hamas representatives Usama Hamdan and Ali Baraka met with Iranian officials at the Iranian embassy to Lebanon in Beirut, a meeting also attended by Hezbollah officials.\nThe meeting came after Hamas diplomat Muhammad Nasser attended a conference in Iran dedicated to the “Palestinian intifada,” which started in October 2015.\nThe source said that the “military wing,” increasingly powerful after the election of their leader Yahya Sinwar as the organization’s chief diplomat, supports renewed ties with Iran, which would likely fill their coffers and further strengthen the military wing.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2017/03/25/exclusive-official-financial-woes-prompt-calls-within-hamas-renew-ties-iran/"}
