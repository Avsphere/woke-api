Smith after the suspect had been Tasered.\nSmith was working traffic enforcement when Brannon was pulled over for a tag violation, Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman Scott Dutton said Thursday.\nA driver’s license check alerted Smith that Brannon should be considered armed and dangerous and was an escape risk, Dutton added.\nBrannon was wanted on outstanding warrants for trafficking in heroin, possession of a sawed-off rifle, sale of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia from the Columbus Police Department, Dutton said.\nAfter pulling Brannon over, Smith requested backup. Before help arrived, Brannon “became non-compliant” and Smith used his Taser on him, Dutton said. However, the Taser “was ineffective” and Brannon pointed a handgun at Smith, who shot him, Dutton said.\nThe incident was captured on the officer’s dash cam video, Dutton said\nBrannon’s body will be transported to the GBI medical examiner’s office in Decatur for an autopsy scheduled for Friday. Once the GBI’s investigation is completed, the case will be turned over to the district attorney, Dutton said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/motorist-killed-bartow-officer-faced-drug-trafficking-warrants/6Tzje7NJ7ZYcrlyAgknPDI/"}
