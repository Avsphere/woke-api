However, Yahoo claims that unhashed passwords and payment details were left protected.\nRevealing their knowledge of the security breach two years prior to announcing it, Yahoo also claimed, “The company had identified that a state-sponsored actor had access to the company’s network in late 2014″ in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nYahoo is currently in the process of being acquired by Verizon, however the company is reportedly seeking a $1 billion discount on their $4.8 billion purchase following the recent controversies surrounding Yahoo.\nThis also includes the revelations that Yahoo has allowed government surveillance agencies to secretly scan through user emails, and a federal lawsuit that is currently being filed against Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, claiming that she led an illegal purge of male employees from the company.\n“I’ve got an obligation to make sure that we protect our shareholders and our investors, so we’re not going to jump off a cliff blindly,” said Verizon Executive Vice Predident Marni Walden about the deal.\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
