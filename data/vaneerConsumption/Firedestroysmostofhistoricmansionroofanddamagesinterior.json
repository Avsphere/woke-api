We have managed to save the chapel, which is attached to the building, and the fire hasn’t spread to that.”\nWe still have 4 fire engines & specialist appliances at Alston Hall. There are still small pockets of flames which are being extinguished. — Lancashire Fire (@LancashireFRS) March 16, 2017\nMr Edney said the damage to the three-storey building could not be properly assessed until it was safe for firefighters to enter the property.\nHe said crews were still tackling small pockets of fire within the building.\nAn investigation into the cause of the fire is expected to start later on Thursday.\nTen fire engines were originally called to tackle the blaze and two aerial ladder platforms were used to pour water into the house, after the collapse of parts of the roof.\nWe were called just before 11pm and firefighters are working to extinguish the large fire. There have been no injuries reported. pic.twitter.com/vy9BhWIlHm — Lancashire Fire (@LancashireFRS) March 16, 2017\nMr Edney said: “There have been no injuries apart from one person suffering a minor ankle injury. There were people at the site when we were called and before we turned up one person had slipped in a panic trying to get out the property.”\nAlston Hall, designed by architect Alfred Darbyshire, was built between 1874-76 for colliery owner John Mercer.\nIt remained a family home until 1949 when the hall was sold to Preston Borough Council for use as a Day Continuation College.\nPicture from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service of the scene at Alston Hall\nIn 1974, the hall was bought by Lancashire County Council who converted it to a residential training centre but it was sold last year.\nThe house had a “little-altered appearance and interior” with “historic joinery, plasterwork, fireplaces and light fittings throughout”, according to a Historic England listing which described the property as “highly decorative”.\nIt is thought that the hall was being converted into a family home by its new owner, a local businessman, when the blaze broke out.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4319232/Scores-firefighters-tackle-blaze-historic-country-mansion.html"}
