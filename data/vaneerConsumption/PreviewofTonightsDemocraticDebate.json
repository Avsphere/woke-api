Jim Webb, named an enemy who is not an American company or organization. Less than a week later, Sen. Webb dropped out of the race. So that answers the question of how long dissenters last in the Democratic party.\nAfter the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, there is no doubt that tonight’s debate should focus on national security. However, Democrats know that is a losing issue for them because after identifying their enemies as the NRA, big banks, and Republicans, they have no credibility on addressing this issue. As Greg Gutfeld tweeted Friday night:\nWith the absence of islamic terror as the central topic of concern, is tomorrows debate rendered pointless? — GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) November 14, 2015\nSure, they will talk about terrorism and security, but they will not identify the real cause because they are afraid–not of Islamic terrorists, but of the same leftists who pushed Sen. Webb out. They are slaves to a PC culture, even while the world burns.\n“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/14/preview-tonights-democratic-debate/"}
