Over 350 gold coins worth a whopping $4.5 million was found from a 300-year-old shipwreck at the same site.\nAccording to Mashable, the unbelievable discovery happened on July 31, which was also the 300th anniversary of a shipwreck of 11 Spanish ships that sank that day in 1715. A video shows the divers picking up the coins in shallow water, just 4 to 6 feet deep.\nOne of the finders, Brent Brisben, tells USA Today that they were literally 10 to 15 feet off the beach when they found the booty.\n\"People love treasure stories. It resonates with everybody â€” every demographic, young and old, rich and poor,\" Brisben said.\n>> Read more trending stories\nNine of the coins discovered were \"Royals\" valued at $300,000 apiece. Those rare coins were designed specifically for King Phillip V. of Spain.\nIn an email, Brisben's fellow diver William Bartlett, who discovered the coins, said, \"For a treasure diver such as myself, a find like this is the equivalent of winning an Olympic gold medal.\"\nThe state of Florida is legally entitled to 20 percent of the discovered coins, which will be put on display in a Tallahassee museum. The remaining loot will be split between Brisben, his co-captain and the diver who discovered the artifacts.\nMobile users, watch HERE.\n(tweet)","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/national/florida-treasure-hunters-find-million-gold-coins/OdP4PkHXMAXvjavICzGElO/"}
