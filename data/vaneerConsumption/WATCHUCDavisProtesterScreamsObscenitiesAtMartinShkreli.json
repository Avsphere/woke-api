In subsequent interviews Shkreli has pointed out that his company has taken steps to ensure that the cost to patients is zero, and that if patients cannot afford the drug, his company gives it away for free.\nABC10 reporter Frances Wang reported that a protester also hurled “what looked like dog poop” at Shkreli. However, Shkreli has told Breitbart Tech that the missile was in fact a pile of leaves.\n#MartinShkreli getting what looked like dog poop thrown at his face after someone yelled \"You piece of s**t\" Vid by @Captain_Hooks @ABC10 pic.twitter.com/zYCiVhzNdb — Frances Wang (@ABC10Frances) January 14, 2017\nShkreli was also filmed outside the venue discussing his plans to explain feminism to MILO.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/social-justice/2017/01/13/watch-uc-davis-protester-screams-obscenities-martin-shkreli/"}
