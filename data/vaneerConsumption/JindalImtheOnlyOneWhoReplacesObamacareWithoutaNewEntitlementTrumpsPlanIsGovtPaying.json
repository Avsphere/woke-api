I’m the only one with a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare without a new entitlement plan. We’ve proposed a very bold tax plan that lowers taxes.”\nJindal was then asked about fellow GOP candidate Donald Trump’s plan, to which Jindal responded, “his plan is for government to pay for everybody’s healthcare. And the problem with that is government then tells you what to eat, how to live your life.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/20/jindal-im-the-only-one-who-replaces-obamacare-without-a-new-entitlement-trumps-plan-is-govt-paying/"}
