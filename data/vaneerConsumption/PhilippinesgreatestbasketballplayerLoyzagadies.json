He then coached the nation to victory in 1967.\n\"Just got word that 'The Big Difference' Caloy Loyzaga just passed. We will be 4ever grateful & honored. RIP #Legend,\" tweeted former national team coach Vincent \"Chot\" Reyes.\nThe professional Philippine Basketball Association league paid tribute to Loyzaga late Wednesday with a moment of silence and a short video presentation at half-time of the 2016 Philippine Cup finals' game five.\nLoyzaga had been in delicate health since suffering a stroke in 2011.\nHis retirement in 1964, to pursue a brief coaching career, ushered in the Philippines' long decline in the sport, now dominated in Asia by China and Iran.\nHowever they have enjoyed a mini-revival in recent years, helped by the aggressive scouting of US-based players with Filipino parentage and the naturalisation of ex-National Basketball Association big man Andray Blatche.\nThe Philippines reached the finals of the last two FIBA Asia championships, losing to Iran in 2013 and to China in 2015.\nThey also qualified for the FIBA World Cup in Spain in 2014, finishing in 21st place.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420382/Philippines-greatest-player-Loyzaga-dies.html"}
