We all deserve to know what went into the federal government’s inconceivable decision to separate thousands of children from their families.”\nBecerra’s request targeted the Justice, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services departments, and included disclosure of senior staff communications—including memorandums, emails, and notes of meetings or calls regarding the “zero tolerance” policy. He specifically is pursuing internal communications from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and the current and former secretaries of Health and Human Services.\nPresident Trump has defended the policy as necessary to stem what he has characterized as a host of societal ills resulting from illegal immigration. “It’s about keeping families together, while at the same time, being sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” he said in a statement.\nBecerra co-leads a coalition of 18 attorneys general that sued President Trump in June over the “zero tolerance” policy. He has sued the Trump administration 39 times times since March 2017.\nNote: This post has been revised to correct the number of lawsuits Becerra has filed against the Trump administration.","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/trump_california/becerra-records-request-immigration-policy/"}
