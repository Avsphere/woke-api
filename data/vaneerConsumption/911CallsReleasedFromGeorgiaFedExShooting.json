The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nNew audio of a 911 call from a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Georgia paints the picture of a chaotic and horrifying scene that unfolded last week.\n\"I’ve been shot,\" security guard Christopher Sparkman says at the beginning of the call, released Tuesday by Cobb County police.\nThe dispatcher asks Sparkman, \"Who did it sir?\" and he responds, “I don’t know, unknown gunman, he’s got a shotgun, I’ve been shot.\n\"Please, tell my wife I love her,” says Sparkman, 28, later adding, “I’m losing energy really fast.\"\nThe dispatcher keeps telling Sparkman to \"stay on the line with me, don't hang up\" as his consciousness seems to be fading.\nSuddenly, a woman can be heard in the background, along with screams, saying: “Is he still here? Is he still here!?” as Sparkman tells the dispatcher he was shot in the left side of the abdomen.\n\"Please hurry, please God, hurry,\" Sparkman pleads over the phone. \"I do not want to die.\"\nWithin moments the dispatcher tells Sparkman that officers are arriving at the FedEx facility in Kennesaw, north of Atlanta.\nSparkman's phone is left on as others can be heard in the background, helping him and talking about the shooter.\nThe operator keeps saying \"hello?\" and asking for a description of the gunman while chaotic shouts continue to escalate in the background.\n\"I know his face\" a man says, noting that the shooter is around 5’10 and white.\n\"And he had a knife,\" a woman adds.\nThe man who opened fire turned out to be Geddy Kramer, a 19-year-old package handler who was later found dead in an apparent suicide after the April 29 rampage.\nA clerk later told reporters the gunman was armed “like Rambo” with a foot-long knife, an assault rifle (in fact it was a 12-gauge shotgun) and bullets draped to his chest.\nThree victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds, while three others were hurt in the commotion.\nAfter several surgeries, Sparkman, a newlywed and Army veteran, has been upgraded from critical to serious condition, according to NBC affiliate WXIA.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/911-calls-released-georgia-fedex-shooting-n98506"}
