Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency for 50 counties that will begin at 2 p.m. Wednesday. “With forecasts showing we could see accumulation by 4 p.m., I want to make sure we get as many commuters home before then as possible,” Deal said in a statement Tuesday night. “While current models show that temperatures will remain above freezing, we don’t want to run the risk of having normal rush hour traffic volume if there’s snow or ice on the highways.\" The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta and north Georgia beginning at 10 a.m. Wednesday. There is a potential for 2 to 4 inches of snowfall in the Atlanta area.
