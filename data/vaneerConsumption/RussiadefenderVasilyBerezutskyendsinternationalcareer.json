Russia coach Stanislav Cherchesov has experimented with various defenders in recent friendlies, with largely unimpressive results, including a loss to Qatar.\nBerezutsky's last game for Russia was a 4-3 loss to Costa Rica in October in which he made several key errors.\nRussia hasn't gone past the group stage at a major tournament since 2008.\nNeither Berezutsky's twin brother Alexei nor his longtime partner at center back, Sergei Ignashevich, has been selected since last year's European Championship. Former captain Roman Shirokov retired after Euro 2016.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4301582/Russia-defender-Vasily-Berezutsky-ends-international-career.html"}
