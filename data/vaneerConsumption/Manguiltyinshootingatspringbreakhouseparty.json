(AP) — An Alabama man has been convicted of numerous counts of attempted murder in connection with the shooting and wounding of seven people at a Florida house party during spring break last year.\nThe Panama City News Herald (bit.ly/1QHnky5) reports that jurors deliberated for less than an hour Thursday before finding 22-year-old David Jamichael Daniels guilty of seven counts of attempted murder, as well as shooting into an occupied building.\nThe shooting prompted Panama City Beach officials to pass a series of emergency ordinances cracking down on the raucous party atmosphere that draws thousands of college and high school students each spring. The Panhandle town has long been known as a major spring break destination.\nDaniels faces a punishment of life in prison at his sentencing, scheduled for March 18.\n___","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421608/Man-guilty-shooting-spring-break-house-party.html"}
