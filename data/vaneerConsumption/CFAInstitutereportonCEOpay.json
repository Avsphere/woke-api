The median pay packet of £4 million is 144 times that of the average Briton, which is around £28,000.\nThe disparity has turned CEO pay into a political issue.\nWill Goodhart, chief executive of CFA UK, said: \"Remuneration committees have spent more time than ever before this year in reaching out to shareholders and stakeholders to discuss compensation structures.\n\"There is an intense focus on pay levels coupled with calls to find better ways of aligning senior executives' incentives with long-term value creation, which for our members is more often measured through economic profit than through accounting profit,\" Goodhart said.\nPrime Minister Theresa May has proposed to introduce binding shareholder votes on CEO pay every year for each company.\nThe policy was called \"a disproportionate response\" to the problem of high executive remuneration, a report from research group Big Innovation Centre said earlier this month.\nThe report, backed by Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, said the policy \"would be likely to have many negative unintended consequences.\"\nIt also criticised plans to publish pay ratios between CEOs and average employees, saying it does not account for natural disparities in pay in industries such as retail.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/cfa-institute-report-on-ceo-pay-2016-12"}
