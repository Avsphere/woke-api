The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe Internet has been gobsmacked by a study finding that hurricanes with female names are more lethal than the ones named after males — after all, who can resist a headline like \"Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Storm\"? But the study's hypothesis about the reason for the phenomenon doesn't exactly rest on a solid foundation.\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed the death tolls from 92 U.S. hurricanes between 1950 and 2012 (excluding Hurricanes Audrey and Katrina as outliers) and determined that the storms named after women produced significantly more casualties.\nThe researchers also conducted six surveys and found that the respondents generally judged male-named hurricanes to be more intense and riskier than female-named storms.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/female-named-hurricanes-are-deadlier-males-why-n120676"}
