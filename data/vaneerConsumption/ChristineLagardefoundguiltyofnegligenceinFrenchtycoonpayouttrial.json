She has denied the negligence charges.\nHer lawyer said immediately after the ruling that his team would look into appealing the decision.\nThe ruling risks triggering a new leadership crisis at the International Monetary Fund after Lagarde's predecessor Dominique Strauss Khan resigned in 2011 over a sex assault scandal.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/christine-lagarde-found-guilty-of-negligence-in-french-tycoon-payout-trial-2016-12"}
