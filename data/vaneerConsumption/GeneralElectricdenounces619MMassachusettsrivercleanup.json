(AP) — General Electric is objecting to a $619 million federal proposal to clean chemicals from a river in western Massachusetts.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency proposed cleaning PCBs from more than 400 acres along a 10.5-mile stretch of the Housatonic River in Pittsfield and Lenox. It includes dredging and trucking contaminated soil and sediment to an out-of-state facility.\nThe Berkshire Eagle (http://bit.ly/1NFdgiL ) reports that GE said in a letter to EPA officials that the plan isn't a \"common-sense solution.\"\nThe company is pushing for a less expensive cleanup that involves dumping excavated material in a landfill.\nGE discharged PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, into the river from a Pittsfield plant from the 1930s until 1977, when the U.S. government banned the use of the chemical. It has been linked to cancer.\n___","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3423114/General-Electric-denounces-619M-Massachusetts-river-cleanup.html"}
