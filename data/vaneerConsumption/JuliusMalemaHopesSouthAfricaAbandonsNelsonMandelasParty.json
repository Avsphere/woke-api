The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nJOHANNESBURG, South Africa - He wears a bright red beret and jumpsuit to represent a “workers’ revolution.”\nJulius Malema is the 33-year-old leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, a new political party that he claims will get 10 percent of the vote as South Africa goes to the polls on Wednesday.\nHis superstar status is down to a sharp mind, a sharper tongue and a powerful message that resonates with many young, black South Africans: Twenty years after the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) party hasn’t delivered.\n“The leadership became selfish, self-serving and started looting state resources for their personal accumulation,” Malema said during an interview with NBC News, referring to rampant official corruption.\n“They no longer care about the masses on the ground,” added Malema, who has vowed to redistribute wealth to the poor.\nMalema has become an outlet for the frustration of much of South Africa’s youth -- anger which might explain why only one-third of adults born after 1994 have bothered to register to vote.\nThis disillusionment of the so-called born free generation -- those born after the end of white-only rule -- in a country where the potential of politics is well known reflects badly on the young democracy.\nWhile South Africa is richer and safer than it was at the end of racist apartheid rule, it is still blighted by racial and economic inequality. And its education system was found to be the 146th best of the 148 countries included in a survey by the World Economic Forum.\n“Our people have been misled for quite some time to believe that everything is good. The reality is that our people are in a worse situation,” said Malema, who is a former head of the ANC Youth League. “It’s no longer the party of Nelson Mandela. It’s no longer advocating what Nelson Mandela stood for.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/africa/julius-malema-hopes-south-africa-abandons-nelson-mandelas-party-n98946"}
