In 2011, for instance, the city had less than 200 murders for the first time since 1978.\nCrime and murder rates have exploded since the riots over the death of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody earlier this year.\nBut the murders are not random. Despite that some shootings still occur in the commission of robberies and other crimes, the largest number of shootings are gang related.\n“There is no randomness associated with these murders,” Commissioner Davis said. “They’re gang related, they’re retaliatory in nature, and they center around drug disputes. And unfortunately, where there are drugs, there’s money, and where there is money, there are guns.”\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/09/5-killed-weekend-violence-baltimore-20-year-high/"}
