Korea? -\nIn the interview -- conducted through an official translator -- Kim said he had spied on behalf of \"South Korean conservative elements\" and taken photos of military secrets.\nThe foreign ministry in Seoul had no immediate comment on the report.\nThe interview with Hyeon Soo Lim began with the pastor being briskly marched inside by two uniformed guards holding his arms.\nThe guards left the room but the South Korean-born Lim, who speaks and understands English, said he had been told to answer all the questions in Korean -- suggesting the conversation was being closely monitored.\nLim was detained by North Korean authorities in January last year after arriving from China.\nAt his sentencing last month, North Korea said he had admitted all charges against him, including \"viciously defaming\" the North Korean system and its leader, and plotting to overthrow the state.\nLim, a pastor at the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto, was the latest in a series of foreign missionaries to be arrested, deported or jailed for allegedly meddling in state affairs.\nLim said he was required to work eight hours a day, six days a week, digging in the orchard of a labour camp with no other prisoners except himself.\nHe said he received regular medical care and three meals a day, and was hoping for a Bible which he had requested but still not received.\n\"I pray every day for the country and the people, I pray for North and South to be reunified, so that a situation like mine won't happen again,\" he said.\nThe interview lasted almost an hour, after which the guard returned and Lim was marched out.\nCanada has protested at the \"unduly harsh\" sentence and complained that consular officials had been denied access to Lim.\nLim was no stranger to North Korea, having led multiple aid missions to the country, involving work with orphanages, nursing homes and food processing factories.\nPyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393214/Canadian-pastor-jailed-N-Korea-struggles-hard-labour.html"}
