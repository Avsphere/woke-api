Unlike most New Yorkers, photographer Langdon Clay spent much of the 1970s walking around Manhattan alone in the middle of the night.\nIt certainly wasn't the safest way to spend his time, but \"being young and foolish can have its advantages,\" Clay told Business Insider.\nWhile roaming the streets, Clay documented the city's cars, peacefully parked and left for the night, reflecting the neon signs and street lights. Though the photographic focus is on the cars, it's hard to ignore the fact that there are very rarely any other people in the shot. Clay's book, \"Cars â€” New York City 1974-1976,\" is a collection of photos of a New York City that will probably never be that eerily quiet again.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-streets-in-the-1970s-2016-12"}
