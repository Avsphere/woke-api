She said the sex wasn't 'forced' but she felt she couldn't say no to him.\nThe house was once rented by Cosby star Keshia Knight Pulliam, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n'What we believe is he was luring these women to this house with promises of either modeling careers or financial assistance. We're not 100 percent sure on that. The investigation is continuing,' Sandy Springs police sergeant Sam Worsham told WSB-TV.\nOfficers helped the eight women leave the home on Tuesday before charging Roberts with false imprisonment and trafficking a person for labor.\nThe 911 recording captured the woman telling the operator she was in a 'very bad situation' and she needed help.\nAs the dispatcher learns more about what's happening, her surprise is clear, her tone at times incredulous: 'Wait. Did you say you're in a house full of girls?'\nThe 20-year-old woman said she was being held in the man's $1million mansion in Sandy Springs, Georgia and he had threatened to kill her if she left\n'Mmm hmm,' the woman responds.\n'And somebody's threatening to kill you if you leave?'\n'Mmm hmm.'\n'Who's threatening to kill you? One of the girls?'\n'No, our boss.'\n'Your boss?'\nThe woman says she knows her boss only as 'Ken something,' that she met him online and that it initially seemed like a good situation because she could make money for dancing.\nShe told the dispatcher that when she arrived about a month ago, he sent her to get plastic surgery.\n'He's, like, so mean I just can't stay,' she said.\nShe described the home as 'a very nice house' in a gated subdivision, with cameras inside. According to Fulton County property records, the two-story brick home measures 6,806 square feet and is valued at $976,300.\nThe woman said Roberts also lived in the house, drove a lot of different cars and generally carried a gun with him.\nThroughout the 14-minute 911 recording, the woman repeatedly says nothing illegal is going on but that she's scared to leave.\n'Does he know holding someone against their will is against the law?' the dispatcher asks.\n'He is so smart. He knows exactly what he's doing,' the woman said. 'He'll be like, 'You can leave whenever you want,' and then he'll, like, threaten you right after.'\nThe woman told the dispatcher she was planning to run out of the house and call a car to come pick her up and take her to the airport because she had to catch a flight home to Orlando, Florida, that friends got for her.\nThe woman asked the dispatcher to have officers pull up in front of the house and that she'll go out to meet them.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301346/Human-trafficker-accused-forcing-strippers-dance.html"}
