Wars are dynamic and the battle will move soon to the depth of their homes, it will happen sooner or later.”\nAl Ansari added that “the little drop of the Russian plane was the beginning and the blessed invasion of Paris will not be the end. … Our Mujahideen are scattered everywhere and will not hesitate to offer their lives for the sake of Allah.”\nHe was asked how ISIS can justify the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Paris, some of whom may have been Muslims.\nAnsari sidestepped the question, asking, “Does France and America and their followers of the Cross alliance differentiate between civilians and armed Mujahideen when they bombard innocent civilians in Raqqa, in Aleppo and in Mosul?”\nWhen Breitbart Jerusalem persisted, Ansari claimed that “dozens of civilians” are killed in “the daily raids of the crusader coalition and then you lie to the world by saying the raids target the headquarters and sites of the Islamic State.”\n“The civilian victims and the areas targeted prove that it has nothing to do with the ISIS infrastructure,” he claimed.\nAnsari went on to bash reports that Middle Eastern refugees may have participated in the Paris massacres. The passport of a Syrian refugee was found on or near the body of one of the suicide bombers, and Greece subsequently confirmed that it was used by a refugee registered on the island of Leros in early October. The same passport was used to cross the southern border of Serbia a few days later.\nNonetheless, Ansari said that “Such claims have nothing to do with reality and are not true. No refugee is among the brothers who carried out these blessed attack. … No refugee who wanted to come and live in France was chosen for this attack.\n“Some political forces are trying to exploit the incident in a campaign against the refugees. Even before the Paris attack, those political forces were against the migrants for numerous reasons that are connected to the nature of their countries and to their general position on the migration phenomenon.”\nAnsari failed to mention that ISIS documents released in February announced that the group was planning to use Libya as a “gateway” to smuggle refugees into Europe.\nThe ISIS material further raised the possibility of storming southern European cities to cause “pandemonium” or attempting to close international shipping lines in the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe documents were released by ISIS supporters and propagandists, and obtained by the Quilliam Foundation, a Britain-based think tank that focuses on counter-extremism.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/11/17/isis-supporter-to-breitbart-were-coming-for-the-u-s-well-shake-your-existence/"}
