And still, measured by the dynamism we see everywhere in the marketplace and by the ever-expanding opportunities we see to invent on behalf of customers, it feels every bit like day one.\"\nAmazon has made Bezos into one of the world's wealthiest individuals, with a fortune estimated at some $50 billion, and he has since created his own space company called Blue Origin and purchased The Washington Post newspaper.\nThe company has not offered details on its revenue from its Amazon Prime membership service, which offers free delivery and a variety of other services, or its own Kindle and Fire devices.\nBut it has broken down the finances from its cloud computing unit called Amazon Web Services: It took in $2.4 billion in revenue in the quarter and $7.9 billion for the year, accounting for an operating profit of $687 million in the quarter and $1.9 billion for the year.\nThe research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon Prime now has 54 million US members, spending on average about $1,100 per year -- much more than the $600 per year spent by non-members.\nAmazon offered no detailed numbers but said worldwide paid Prime memberships increased 51 percent last year.\nThose who subscribe get access to much of Amazon's video streaming library for free as well as music and other content.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3421823/Amazon-delivers-big-profit-boost-misses-forecast.html"}
