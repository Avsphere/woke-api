Security at the two-week event is extremely important, especially after the massacre in Tunisia.\n“It is an offence to fly a drone within 50 metres of a structure,” explained Inspector Roger Robinson. “Anyone intending to fly a drone should give prior consideration to the surrounding landscape and any structures or venues.”\nA man at a nearby golf course controlled the device. There is no information about an arrest or charges.\nThe drone caused a few to question security, but the Metropolitan Police assured the public that Wimbledon is a top priority.\n“The Wimbledon Tennis Championships are a regular feature in our calendar and one of the great British sporting events which we are ready to police,’ said Chief Superintendent Stuart Macleod, adding:\n“At the conclusion of last year’s Championships the Met’s planning team started preparing for this year’s tournament. We have reflected on previous operational plans and amended these where necessary to ensure we deliver a safe and secure Championships for 2015. “This year’s event will be policed to a level proportionate with the current threat level. We have worked closely in partnership with the All England Club and other partner agencies to ensure the Championships can be enjoyed by all those attending.”\nPolice with detection dogs swarmed The All England Lawn Tennis Club on Saturday, including the press room. The Met promised more road closures and officers on the outside of the courts as well.\nA gunman roamed the beaches at a Tunisian vacation resort where he murdered 38 people, including 15 Britons. The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) took responsibility. Prime Minister David Cameron told the country “to remain ‘vigilant’ in the threat of terror and ‘carry on.’”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/06/28/police-seize-drone-at-wimbledon-beef-up-security-due-to-terrorist-threat/"}
