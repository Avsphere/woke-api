Their task became even more difficult, and more exhausting, on Monday night when Ander Herrera’s first-half dismissal left them with 10 men for almost an hour in their 1-0 loss. The trip back to Manchester was hardly routine either as they had to navigate the M6 overnight due to a problem with their scheduled flight, so will a gruelling few days have an impact on Thursday?\nWho will Mourinho entrust to play?\nMourinho still has issues in attack having deemed that Anthony Martial is not ready to feature, despite training on Wednesday, while Wayne Rooney remains sidelined with injury too. Zlatan Ibrahimovic will almost certainly play because he has another two games left to run on his domestic ban and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who scored in the first leg, has been kept fresher than most having been withdrawn moments after Herrera’s dismissal at Chelsea. The much-scrutinised Paul Pogba has played every minute of United’s past five games and Mourinho’s staunch defence of him on Thursday suggests he will be kept in.\nHow will Pogba respond?\nPaul Pogba (left) will be under scrutiny after an underwhelming display at Chelsea (Nick Potts/PA)\nThe world’s most expensive player bore the brunt of the criticism as United exited the FA Cup at the hands of Chelsea. His manager had claimed he was the “best player on the pitch” but the Frenchman’s doubters have been underwhelmed by several of Pogba’s performances since his return to Old Trafford – a fact Mourinho attributed to “envy” on Wednesday. The spotlight will therefore be on the 24-year-old once again in this fixture and it will be intriguing to see if he delivers a response to those naysayers when he takes to the field.\nCan United be ruthless at home?\nManchester United have been profligate at Old Trafford this season (Martin Rickett/PA)\nOn too many occasions this year United have failed to emerge victorious from home contests they have dominated. They have drawn seven times at Old Trafford in the Premier League and the likes of Burnley, Hull, Bournemouth, Stoke and West Ham have all earned a share of the spoils thanks to United’s profligacy in front of goal. It has been a different story when Mourinho’s men have played on familiar terrain in this competition as they have won all four home games and scored 12 times. More of the same will see United advance.\nCan a depleted Rostov pose problems?\nRostov will be without Aleksandr Gatskan, left (Denis Tyrin/AP)\nRostov know that due to the current aggregate score they will need to score in Manchester and there is a clear sense that their best chance of eliminating United would have been with a triumph in Russia, where Ajax and Bayern Munich had already been beaten this season. Rostov are without a victory in their previous five away games in European competitions and are shorn of the injured Vladimir Granat and the suspended Aleksandr Gatskan and Timofei Kalachev in England. With those three pivotal figures missing, it would be a shock if United’s run in this competition is ended by the Russians.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4318942/Manchester-United-v-FC-Rostov-talking-points.html"}
