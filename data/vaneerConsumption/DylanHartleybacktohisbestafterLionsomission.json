He is determined to enjoy his time out in Argentina, continue to captain England well, as he has been doing, then if there is a chance for him – if an injury occurs – he will be ready to go out there (to New Zealand).\n‘There will be injuries and call-ups. I went on one tour with England and on that I saw a number of call-ups, going to the Lions.\n'That will happen again this year. Because Dylan missed a bit of time earlier in the season, he’s not desperate for the season to end. He’s looking forward to the matches to come and he wants to produce a big finale.’\nJamie George, Hartley's understudy for his country, was selected ahead of the England skipper\nIreland captain Rory Best and Wales hooker Ken Owens were also preferred by Gatland","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-4448316/Dylan-Hartley-best-Lions-omission.html"}
