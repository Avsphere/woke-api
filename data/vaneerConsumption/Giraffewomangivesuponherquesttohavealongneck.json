I tried sticking my neck out to make it work but logic kicked in after a while.'\nSacrifice: Sydney, pictured with the rings, found her unusual quest was taking over her life\nAgony: The coils left Sydney with severe bruising and made her neck feel 'very weak'\nSydney still considers herself the 'Giraffe Woman,' although these days her neck is in physical therapy a couple of times a week to ease the stiffness caused by the weight of the rings.\nWhen Sydney took the necklace off, she had severe bruising around her collarbone and said her 'neck felt very weak, kind of like arms on a toothpick.'\nHer recovery is moving along faster than doctors predicted and Sydney doesn't regret her attempts to lengthen her neck.\nTransformation: Sydney said she felt her neck did stretch with the coils but has now shrunk\n'People have this misconception that they think that your neck is going to look super long when you remove the rings,' she said.\n'It goes back to normal. I do feel my neck is longer than when I started but I feel like it has shrunk since I took them off.\n'I really enjoyed the feeling of the rings around my neck. I miss the sensation of the weight on the collarbones, which was in a weird way very comforting.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4319364/Giraffe-woman-gives-quest-long-neck.html"}
