He has never won elected office as a Democrat and had only discussed his plans with a few family members and supporters. But after that, he said he was likely to announce his candidacy in June.\nFormer [Governor], once a Republican, then an independent, then a Democrat, plans to announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination next week.\nHe’s a distinct longshot. By his own admission, he’s not been actively raising money or building the organization needed for a credible bid for the nomination, although he’s traveled to the early-voting states of New Hampshire and South Carolina.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/05/29/democrat-chafee-to-announce-for-president-on-wednesday/"}
