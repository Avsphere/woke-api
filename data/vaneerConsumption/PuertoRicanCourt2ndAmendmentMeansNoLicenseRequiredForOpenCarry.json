Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) in making its decision.\nHeller is the case in which the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) struck down the D.C. gun ban as a federal district violation of the right to self-defense, and McDonald is the case in which the SCOTUS ruled that gun rights are incorporated and, therefore, as equally protected from state violations as they are from federal.\nIn light of the Puerto Rican court’s decision, “there is [currently] no regulation to purchase or carry (and) all purchases will be handled in accordance with federal firearms regulations.”\nSAF president Alan M. Gottlieb commented on the decision: “Cumbersome firearms regulations have never prevented criminals from getting their hands on guns. They have only inconvenienced law-abiding citizens, or deprived them outright from exercising their rights under the Second Amendment.”\nConcealed carry of firearms is legal in all 50 states and open carry, with certain stipulations, is the law of the land in 45 states. In six of these 45 states—Arizona, Alaska, Kansas, Montana, Vermont, and Wyoming—law-abiding citizens can carry openly or concealed without a permit. Puerto Rico is now aligned with these six states.\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
