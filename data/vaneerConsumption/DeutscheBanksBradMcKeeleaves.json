He spoke about \"infuriating\" news stories about the bank, and the fact that clients don't call as much when the bank is in the headlines.\n\"The only way to combat this is actually to deliver what we said we're going to deliver and improve the bank and, where possible, meet our targets,\" he said. \"And hopefully, people get immune to the fact that there's all sorts of nonsense spoken about the bank from time to time, and they listen to the official communications and not to speculation.\"\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/deutsche-banks-brad-mckee-leaves-2016-11"}
