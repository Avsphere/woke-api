In total Bowie released 111 singles – including five UK number ones – 26 studio albums, 46 compilation albums, five EPs and three soundtracks.\nHe collected dozens of awards, including two Brits Awards, two Grammys and three MTV awards and transferred his artistry to film in 51 music videos.\nHe took leading roles in blockbuster films, from The Man Who Fell To Earth in 1976 to a cameo in 2001's Zoolander and was also recognised for his sartorial edge by GQ magazine.\nHis liberal sexual prowess was also legendary, seducing male and female lovers alike including a Playboy model, singer Nina Simone, Charlie Chaplin's widow and a transsexual among others, sometimes 'bisexually multi-timing' his partners, as one ex described it.\nIn an interview with Jonathan Ross some years ago he avoided answering the question of whether he was gay or bisexual, simply to say: 'I just got my leg over a lot.'\nSome star names including Oscar winner Susan Sarandon and singer Lulu have said they had dalliances with him.\nBorn David Robert Jones on January 8, 1947, in Brixton, south London, to mother Margaret 'Peggy', a waitress, and charity worker Haywood 'John' Jones, Bowie's musical talent was clear from an early age and he had his first taste for rock music through the record collection of his older brother, Terry.\nThe family moved to south east London, where he graduated from Bromley Technical High School at 16.\nHe formed a number of bands and led a group calling himself Davy Jones, later changing his name to David Bowie to avoid confusion with the Davy Jones from the Monkees.\nThe name was said to be inspired by a knife developed by the 19th century American pioneer Jim Bowie.\nScroll down for videos\nAs a Seventies superstar, he trumpeted to the press that he was gay at a time when even Elton John was still in the closet, then amended it to bisexual. Many have enjoyed speculating – as his first wife Angie once did – that David and Mick Jagger (above) were lovers\nHe decided to set out on his own as a solo artist, releasing three singles for Pye Records and his debut album, The World Of David Bowie.\nBut the records did not achieve the huge success he would go on to experience and he retreated to a Buddhist monastery in Scotland in 1967\nAfter returning to London he started arts troupe Feathers in 1968.\nAs the group eventually separated, he helped create the Beckenham Arts Lab in 1969 before releasing the hit Space Oddity on July 11 that year, his first UK number one.\nA string of albums followed before 1972's The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars made him an international star.\nThe album, which tells the story of an alien rockstar, saw Bowie indulge his eye for the theatrical with a string of live shows and television appearances that saw him conquer America and create an otherworldly reputation that still clings to him.\nAt the same time, he was producing albums for Lou Reed and Iggy Pop and writing one of his greatest songs – All The Young Dudes – which he promptly gave away to Mott The Hoople who had a massive hit with it.\nBowie's announcement – during a London gig – that he was retiring Ziggy did not stop the commercial success and the hits kept coming as he toured and recorded albums including Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs and his tribute to the swinging London scene that inspired him, Pin Ups.\nDavid Bowie outside Bromley Registry office on March 20 1970 after marrying Angie Barnett (right), seen here with her mother\nBowie with his wife Angie Bowie with son Zowie Bowie now Duncan Jones in February 1974 in Amsterdam\nBowie with his son, Zowie Bowie – a film director now known as Duncan Jones – at the 8th Annual Tribeca Film Festival's premiere of 'Moon' at BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Centre in New York in 2009\nHis soul-inspired Young Americans saw him change direction again and gave him his first US number one when his collaboration with John Lennon on Fame topped the charts in 1975.\nBowie played on his alien alter-ego with a successful move into acting – playing the lead character in the science fiction film The Man Who Fell To Earth, before moving to Berlin.\nThe influence of the then divided city inspired a trio of albums – Low, Heroes and Lodger – which produced hits including Sound And Vision and Boys Keep Swinging and are widely regarded as among his finest work.\nIn March 1970, he married Angie and the pair had a son, Zowie Bowie — a film director now known as Duncan Jones.\nThe rock star formed a number of bands and led a group calling himself Davy Jones, later changing his name to David Bowie to avoid confusion with the Davy Jones from the Monkees\nA decade later, he split from his wife, reportedly over rumours about his sexuality.\nAngie, who is currently a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother, has not spoken to the singer for nearly 40 years.\nIn an interview published in the Daily Mail today, she claims he forced her into an open marriage and turned their son against her.\nDuncan has not spoken to Angie all this time either.\n'That is because David poisoned the boy against me,' she said.\nBeing shunned by both Bowie men has, Angie told her housemates, left her with a broken heart.\n'My job was managing David and when I was offloaded I couldn't work with anyone else as a manager.\n'That's the reason why I was heartbroken; I had no work and a son. So I wasn't interested in fighting David for custody because I didn't have a job,' she explained.\nBoth were bisexual and wildly promiscuous, with a marriage as open as a Saturday morning sweetshop, but Angie says it was not what she wanted.\nAngie told The Daily Mail's Jan Moir: 'I was a little suspect of him. He did a lot of cavorting.\n'When we got married, it soon became apparent that it had to be an open marriage if it was going to work for him.\n'I liked him, loved him, cared about him, but I was not going to be humiliated and not treated with dignity and respect.\n'So I made sure I did plenty of cavorting myself because that means the playing field was levelled.'\nThe 1980s saw Bowie combine his rock career with appearances in films including Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence and Absolute Beginners.\nThe rise of the New Romantic scene in the UK betrayed an obvious Bowie influence and he continued to record and tour filling massive US stadiums and selling albums by the million.\n1988 brought a new venture – and what many fans thought was a new low – when he returned as one quarter of rock band Tin Machine.\nTheir initial success soon faded and by 1993 Bowie was back on his own with the solo album Black Tie White Noise.\nFROM KATY PERRY TO PRINCE AND LADY GAGA: WHY DAVID BOWIE WAS A TRAILBLAZER FOR ARTISTS WHO DIDN'T WANT TO CONFORM SEXUALLY David Bowie was a trailblazer for artists with non-conforming sexual and gender identities, a rock music expert said. Dr Simon Warner praised Bowie for having the 'courage to stand up on stage' as a sexually ambiguous artist. The Bowie fan and former music journalist claims Prince, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga have all been influenced by Bowie. He said the Brixton-born star was the 'most important British popular musician other than the Beatles' and generations to come will rediscover his large catalogue of music. 'Most important British popular musician other than the Beatles': Non-conformists: Katy Perry (left) and Lady Gaga (right) are among the stars who havel been influenced by Bowie, says a rock music expert Dr Warner, course leader in the BA of Popular and World Musics at the University of Leeds, saw Bowie live in the early 1980s as part of his Serious Moonlight Tour. He said: 'I think he has influenced any artist who has played with issues of gender and sexuality. Katy Perry, Prince and Lady Gaga I would say have been influenced. 'He was the first person to say it's possible to be a man on stage and to be sexually ambiguous. 'In the decades that have followed many would take to the stage who would be gay or sexually ambiguous. He had the courage to stand up. 'It was extremely brave at the the time. In the UK, the Sexual Offences Act had just been passed. 'I don't know whether Bowie would have seen it as political but it was brave.' The 1967 Sexual Offences Act ammendment decriminalised sex between men who were over 21. Dr Warner continued: 'I think he will be remembered for his interested in the visual, in the creative wrapping of music. 'I think he was extraordinary because he didn't stick to one successful formula. He had the ability to change and reinvent himself. 'He would create things like Ziggy Stardust and then leave it to die. 'I would see him as the most important popular British musician other than the Beatles. His legacy will be long and I feel people will continue to go back to his music. 'He won't just be remembered by today's 20-year-olds but I think his music will continue to be rediscovered by future younger generations in the years to come.'\nBowie played on his alien alter-ego Ziggy Stardust with a successful move into acting - playing the lead character in the science fiction film The Man Who Fell To Earth (above)\nThe 1980s saw him combine his rock career with appearances in films including Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence and Absolute Beginners\nHe had married supermodel Iman a year earlier and settled in New York but continued to tour and record until 2003 when he released Reality.\nIt was his 23rd – and many assumed last – studio album and was followed by some low-key live appearances, an acting role in the 2006 film The Prestige, but no new music until last year when he returned with the widely acclaimed The Next Day.\nThe album won praise and earned him a place on the Mercury Prize shortlist, although he missed out to James Blake.\nIn her explosive memoirs released last week, Bowie's former landlady told how he seduced her over tea, music and cannabis one afternoon in 1969.\nMary Finnigan, a single mother-of-two who at 30 was seven years his senior, lifted the lid on on an extraordinary period when, for six psychedelic months, Bowie perked up not just the 'commuter dormitory' of Beckenham, but also her home, suburban family life and bed with his 'very horny' and 'sexually sophisticated' attentions until everything was 'fizzing with excitement and activity'.\nThen his good friend Angie Barnett, who later became his wife, all but moved in to join the fun.\nMary later discovered that he was not only unfaithful, but was also bisexual and polyamorous.\n'He had been bisexually multi-timing me for the entire period of our relationship,' Mary said earlier this week.\n'I was just one among many of whom Angie was probably the principal.'\nBowie with his wife Iman at the opening night of the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Centre in New York in 2006\nLANDMARK ALBUMS IN DAVID BOWIE'S CAREER David Bowie (1967) Bowie's first solo album was released shortly after his novelty single The Laughing Gnome and failed to ignite the imagination of the record-buying public. Space Oddity (1969) Despite the hit single, the record was not a commercial success on its first release. Hunky Dory (1971) Now considered one of the great albums of the 1970s, Hunky Dory was not a huge commercial success at the time. It features classic tracks including Life On Mars and Changes. It became a much bigger success when it was re-released following the rise of Bowie's Ziggy Stardust incarnation. The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars (1972) Bowie's concept album about an alien rock star is still considered his seminal work and, together with the Ziggy Stardust alter-ego he created, the album catapulted him into the stratosphere of rock and pop stardom. The Berlin Trilogy The albums Low (1977), Heroes (1977) and Lodger (1979) were made when Bowie moved from the United States to Berlin and marked another sharp change for the singer. Let's Dance (1983) One of Bowie's most commercially successful albums and seen as his most mainstream creation. Tin Machine (1989) Bowie created a traditional four-piece rock band in an effort to rejuvenate his career and return to a more straightforward style. The Next Day (2013) Bowie surprised the world with this release on his 66th birthday - a decade after his last album. It received widespread critical acclaim. Blackstar (2016) Released only two days before his death on his 69th birthday. The album was already well received by critics and is now being scoured for references to his illness.\nHe would also dally with English aristocrat Sabrina Guinness, but for much of the decade, the love in his life was dancer Melissa Hurley, 20 years his junior.\nThey were engaged, but split in 1990, and that October, at a friend's party in Los Angeles, Bowie met Iman.\nBowie continued to tour and record until 2003, when he released Reality.\nThe same year he sparked headlines when he turned down a knighthood in the Queen's New Year honours because he reportedly viewed the honours as a 'waste of time'.\nThen during his tour in 2004, Bowie suffered a major health scare when he had a heart attack on stage in Germany.\nThe rest of the tour was cancelled as the singer recuperated, reducing his musical output for the next two years.\nDuring this time he worked on music for films such as Shrek 2 and Stealth, and collaborated with Canadian band Arcade Fire and Lou Reed.\nIn 2006, Bowie returned to acting, playing the part of scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla in the Chris Nolan-directed film The Prestige.\nA year later, he starred as himself in an episode of Ricky Gervais's comedy series Extras.\nHe received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.\nIn November of that year, he performed alongside Alicia Keys at the Black Ball, a New York benefit for Keep A Child Alive.\nThis was the last time he performed live, despite constant hope from his fans that he would reverse his decision to quit live performances.\nOn his 66th birthday in January 2013, Bowie revealed he had been back in the studio and would be releasing his first album of new material.\nIn time with the announcement he released the single Where Are We Now? and the full album followed in March that year.\nThe record was Bowie's first featuring new material for 10 years and was received warmly by critics and fans, becoming his first album to reach number one since Black Tie White Noise, released in 1993.\nWhere Are We Now? was recognised with a Brit Award in 2014, making Bowie the oldest ever recipient when he collected the prize for Best British Male, although the gong was collected on his behalf by supermodel Kate Moss.\nHis classic record Let's Dance was re-released in July last year and he released his 25th and final studio album, Blackstar, last Friday.\nFloral tributes are placed at a mural of David Bowie in Brixton, south London, where the singer was born\nA vigil at an artist's graffiti tribute to David Bowie in Brixton, South London, after the news broke of his death\nDavid Bowie (top row, second left) pictured as a pupil at Burnt Ash Primary School in Bromley, Greater London\nA view of the house in Stansfield Road (centre), in Brixton, south London, where David Bowie was born\nProducer Tony Visconti, who worked with Bowie on his last studio album, Blackstar, said: 'He always did what he wanted to do.\n'And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his life – a work of art.\n'He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the way it would be.\n'I wasn't, however, prepared for it. He was an extraordinary man, full of love and life. He will always be with us. For now, it is appropriate to cry.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393517/David-Bowie-s-life-Stardust-Boy-Brixton-grew-global-superstar-bisexual-affairs-rock-roll-drugs-way.html"}
