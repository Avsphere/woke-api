'I think it’s about looking at what’s happening in your county, your town, your city, right now. If Americans can think small, they can do much bigger things.'\nSharp minds: Appearing with Weinstein and Jay Z were (L-R) comic Michael Che, legal expert Jeffrey Toobin and TV personality Gayle King\nThe 99 Problems hit-maker said the public has to hold elected officials culpable for unjust incidents like Browder's in order for the wheels of change to spin.\n'We put people in office, we make the laws,' he said. 'These government officials? They work for us. They speak to us like we work for them, but we are the power.'\nHe said that while three million viewers saw the miniseries in its first week, the number needs to be closer to 20 million to ramp up the buzz that will lead to scrutiny and pressure on decision-makers to ensure something like this never happens again.\nMust-see: The Empire State of Mind artist said Browder's 'death is here to teach us to save a generation of kids'\nHeartbreaking: Browder spent three years at Rikers Island prison, two in solitary confinement\n'We need everyone to be talking about this,' he said. 'That’s how this stops.'\nWeinstein said that a documentary about the chain of events that led to Browder's death was 'so unbelievably due in America.'\nTIME: The Kalief Browder Story airs 10/9c on Spike TV Wednesday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4300152/Jay-Z-Kalief-Browder-s-death-save-generation.html"}
