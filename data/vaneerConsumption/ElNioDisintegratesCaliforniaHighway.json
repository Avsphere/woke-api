The highway serves as a route between Weaverville and nearby Yreka.\nThe highway remained closed Monday night into Tuesday. The entire road could be subject to a long-term closure due to the extensive nature of the damage, according to local ABC affiliate KRCR.\nNo injuries were reported.\nPortions of California have seen the Pacific El Niño return with a vengeance this week. The weather pattern has dumped billions of gallons of water into California’s reservoirs this month, and has also added to the state’s critical snowpack after a hot, dry February.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2016/03/16/norcal-highway-disintegrates-due-to-el-nino-rain/"}
