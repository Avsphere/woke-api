The fire was relatively small but created a lot of smoke, he said.\nOne of the two occupants rescued was found in a bedroom on the second floor. Johnson said the man is hearing-impaired and was not aware of the fire. He suffered some smoke inhalation but was treated at the scene and refused to go to the hospital.\nThe other occupant, a woman, also did not go to the hospital.\nThe house had minimal damage, Johnson said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/two-people-rescued-from-virginia-highland-house-fire/VeQQ0vsLWllxVNITlWpctL/"}
