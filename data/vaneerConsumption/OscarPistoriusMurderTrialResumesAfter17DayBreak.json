She also noted that her ex \"sounds like a man,\" when he screams — disputing an assertion brought by lead defense lawyer Barry Roux that screams heard by neighbors were those of Pistorius alone, not Steenkamp.\nAnd Taylor said she knew those screams well, claiming Pistorius often yelled at her, before ending the years-long relationship by cheating on her with Steenkamp.\nText messages from Steenkamp were read aloud to further shed light on Pistorius’ short temper. \"I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and how you will act towards me,\" said one.\nThe longer string of text message conversations between the couple, the majority of which, Roux pointed out, were loving, caused Pistorius to break down crying, something that he was prone to do, especially when details of the crime scene were shared.\n“I remember. I don’t have to look at a picture. I was there.”\nWhen portions of the autopsy on Steenkamp’s body were read by a pathologist, Pistorius retched and threw up. He vomited again when close-up images of Steenkamp’s mutilated corpse were displayed. Pistorius covered his ears with his hands while a police ballistics expert said Steenkamp was in a \"defensive position\" when she was shot.\nThe Defense\nThroughout the prosecution, Roux has sought to prove that the crime scene had been handled carelessly by police, which he argued would have contaminated evidence.\nRoux first called a pathologist to the stand, and pictures of the bloodied bathroom and body were once again exhibited, leading Pistorius to retch once again shortly before he testified.\nBut Pistorius composed himself and preceded his statements with an apology to Steenkamp’s family, which appeared to do little to affect her mother, who sat nearly expressionless during the beginning of the the runner’s testimony.\nThat first day of testimony, before Pistorius was cross examined, was the defendant’s chance to portray himself as a man petrified of violence who was simply trying to protect the woman he cared for, and who cared for him.\nPistorius spent the next day on the stand recounting the night he killed his girlfriend, explaining that he thought someone had climbed into the bathroom window, but when he realized his girlfriend could be on the other side of the door, he smashed it with a cricket bat.\n\"I sat over Reeva and I cried,” he recalled, shaking.\nProsecutor Gerrie Nel — nicknamed \"The Pitbull\" — wasted no time getting to the heart of the state’s case when cross-examining the only witness who knows what happened the night Steenkamp died.\n\"You killed Reeva Steenkamp ... Say it,\" Nel demanded of Pistorius.\nPistorius’ time on the stand didn't get any easier as Nel showed a video of Pistorius practice-shooting at a watermelon, then showed a gory crime scene picture, offering a comparison of the exploding watermelon to Steenkamp's head.\n\"I remember. I don’t have to look at a picture. I was there,\" Pistorius responded.\nNel focused on establishing that the track star \"concocted\" his account of the shooting, accusing him of lying, and urging Pistorius to take responsibility for Steenkamp's death.\n“I blame myself for taking Reeva's life,\" Pistorius eventually said.\nBefore he left the stand, Pistorius read a Valentine’s Day card from Steenkamp — a note that Pistorius said he didn't see until after his girlfriend was dead. \"I think today is a good day to tell you that … I love you,” he read aloud to the court.\nWhat’s next?\nPistorius’ team will continue to try to prove that the crime scene was altered by police, and that neighbors who heard Steenkamp's screams before gunshots actually heard Pistorius’ screams before he whacked the door down with a cricket bat.\nRoger Dixon, a forensic expert for the defense, already testified that the bedroom was too dark to see that Steenkamp got out of bed and said he conducted an audio test that indicated sounds of a cricket bat hitting wood could be mistaken for gunshots.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/pistorius-trial/oscar-pistorius-murder-trial-resumes-after-17-day-break-n96716"}
