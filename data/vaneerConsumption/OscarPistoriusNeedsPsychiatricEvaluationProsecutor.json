The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nPRETORIA, South Africa - The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius said Monday that the double-amputee athlete should be placed under psychiatric observation after an expert called by the defense said the runner has an anxiety disorder.\nJudge Thokozile Masipa has not yet ruled on the request. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said he had no other option but to ask for a study of Pistorius' mental health following testimony by a psychiatrist, who said the Olympian's anxiety could have shaped the way he responded to perceived threats.\nPistorius has said he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp by mistake last year, fearing that there was an intruder in his home when he fired through a closed toilet door early on Feb. 14, 2013. The prosecution says he killed her intentionally after an argument.\nAfter interviewing Pistorius earlier this month, psychiatrist Dr. Merryll Vorster testified that the sprinter \"appears to be a mistrustful and guarded person.\"\nPistorius' defense said at the outset of its case that it would show his feelings of \"vulnerability\" and his disability contributed to him shooting Steenkamp. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.\nVorster's testimony also dealt with what she said was Pistorius' fear of crime and how, because he was a double amputee, he reacted to perceived threats in a different way to other people. She noted Pistorius' mother, who died when he was a teenager, slept with a gun in her bed.\nProsecutor Nel asked if Vorster was saying Pistorius had a mental illness and should undergo period of observation, and if he was changing his defense to one of \"diminished responsibility.\"\nNel also asked the psychiatrist if someone who was suffering from an anxiety order of the kind that she had diagnosed in Pistorius, and also had access to guns, would be a danger to society. Vorster said the person would, indeed, be a danger.\nTalking specifically about the shooting of Steenkamp, Vorster said Pistorius was more likely to try and \"fight\" what he thought was an intruder than run away, because his disability meant it was harder for him to flee.\nThe trial continues.\n- The Associated Press","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/pistorius-trial/oscar-pistorius-needs-psychiatric-evaluation-prosecutor-n103096"}
