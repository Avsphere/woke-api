Bitcoin surged by 4% overnight after Trump's victory in the US presidential election, while the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and all major European indices dropped dramatically. Bitcoin is an alternative asset, like precious metals and art, and as such, it doesn't correlate with the stock market, which makes it an attractive diversifier. It is also a decentralized currency and not tied to any single country's policy decisions, which is a great advantage in times of political and economic uncertainty.\nA spate of new bitcoin products has reassured investors. A number of players recently entered the market with bitcoin-based offerings geared at mainstream investors â€” for example, the Winklevoss brothers' bitcoin ETF and investment solutions from blockchain hedge fund Polychain. Such products are helping to reinforce bitcoin's image as a reliable investment. In addition, bitcoin and blockchain platform Lisk announced new transparency measures last Wednesday.\nIt's been getting more coverage and exposure. In November, the CEO of Blockchain, a successful London-based bitcoin wallet, said the company was on track to have its busiest month to date; and Circle, a US-based bitcoin money transfer app, made the news due to major changes to its business model. Such media exposure will likely help the still poorly understood asset enter the public consciousness.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-bitcoin-boomed-in-2016-2016-12"}
