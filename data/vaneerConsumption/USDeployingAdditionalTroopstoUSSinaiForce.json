Roger Cabiness II, a Department of Defense (DoD) spokesman, confirmed to Breitbart News at the time that the U.S. military was planning to take additional measures to ensure the protection of its lightly equipped force in the Sinai Peninsula “in light of the security situation in parts of Northeastern Sinai.”\nThe American soldiers are in Sinai as part of the MFO that ensures compliance with the 1979 peace accord between Egypt and Israel.\n“Egypt has been battling a long-running insurgency in the region that has grown since the 2011 popular uprising against longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. After the army overthrew his successor, Mohammed Morsi, in July 2013, attacks surged,” reports AP. “A local jihadi group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group last year, renaming itself Sinai Province and killing scores of soldiers.”\nLast month, AP learned from senior members of the Obama administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity, that the U.S. had been “quietly” conducting an “inter-agency review” of the U.S. posture in the Sinai Peninsula, “fearful the lightly equipped peacekeepers could be targets of escalating Islamic State-inspired violence.”\nThe options that were being considered by the Obama administration at the time were bolstering protection for U.S. troops or withdrawing them altogether.\n“We are concerned over security conditions in that area of the northeastern Sinai where Egyptian security forces as well as civilian and military elements of the MFO, including U.S. military forces stationed at the MFO north camp, are exposed to potential risk,” Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told reporters on Tuesday, reiterating that the Obama administration supports the peacekeeping force in Sinai.\n“And in light of the security situation there, we are, again, considering additional measures to bolster their protection going forward, taking steps to try and enhance their protection,” he aded.\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been cracking down on jihadists in his country.\nNevertheless, some news reports suggest ISIS has continued to make advances in Egypt, launching a growing number of attacks in the restive Sinai region.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/09/11/u-s-deploying-additional-troops-support-equipment-to-u-s-sinai-force/"}
