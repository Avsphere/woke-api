HERMES BIRKIN\nFashion expert Penelope Blanckaert for Artcurial auctioneer in Paris and Monte Carlo has seen the value of Hermes handbags increase by 500 per cent over the last 35 years, left a Birkin, and right a Nile Monitor lizard-skin Birkin which sold at auction at Artcurial last week for 30,500 euros (£23,100)\nModel Irina Shayk pictured with her white Birkin at the Givenchy menswear show in June, the bag is a classic which Penelope rates as never losing its money\nIt takes a full two days to create each Birkin, and prices for the much sought-after bag start from around £6,000. If you're thinking of a future investment, you'll need to make a decision fast as there's a six-year waiting list.\nBuying second-hand is an option - a black Birkin from Collector Square will set you back £7,000.\nPenelope rated the Hermes Birkin as a sound way to invest as it will 'never lose its money.'\nShe told FEMAIL: 'You can't make a mistake buying a Birkin. The Birkin market has been going up for 30 years and now it's gone up by 500 per cent over the last 35 years.'\nShe also advised buying a bag in an unusual size can really increase the value, like the 25cm Birkin bag that is very popular with Asian clients, she said.\nHermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas created the bag for the singer Jane Birkin after he was sat next to her on a 1984 flight and she complained she could not find a leather carrier she liked.\nLast week, Artcurial held a vintage Hermes sale which saw a crocodile-skin 30cm Birkin sell for 41,480 euros (£31,500) while a Nile Monitor lizard-skin Birkin sold for 30,500 euros (£23,100).\nA bespoke Barbie-pink crocodile skin bag, with diamond-encrusted hardware became the most expensive ever sold at auction, going for £146,000 back in July 2015 at Christie's in Hong Kong.\n2. CHRISTIAN DIOR LADY DIOR\nThe Lady Dior, by Christian Dior, is another bankable classic because of its link with Princess Diana. A black patent vintage version from Far Fetch costs £3,155\nPrincess Diana wore the bag which became iconic after being given to her as a gift by France's first lady Bernadette Chirac, in Birmingham, in 1995\nPenelope cited the Lady Dior, by Christian Dior, as another classic because of its link with Princess Diana. A black patent vintage version from Far Fetch costs £3,155.\nIn 1995, the French first lady Bernadette Chirac, wife of former president Jacques Chirac, wanted to give the visiting princess a unique handbag as a gift.\nShe contacted Dior who provided the bag, then unofficially called the Chouchou, to give as a gift. Diana was seen with the bag many times and it was renamed 'Princesse' but later called Lady Dior.\nThe stitched square pattern on the bag was reportedly inspired by the Napoleon III chairs used in Dior's first ever fashion show in 1947.\nPenelope recommended the bag as an intelligent investment because it is likely to do well at auction, she said it 'already has status because of her'.\n3. HERMES KELLY\nThis 28cm red crocodile-skin Hermes Kelly went for 38,500 euros (£29,200), Penelope recommends investing in the bag and choosing 'exceptional skins like crocodile or unusual colours'\nThe bag, which takes around 18 hours to make, was made popular by Monaco monarch Grace Kelly - who it is now named after\nPenelope cited the Hermes Kelly as another classic which she believes is one of the top 10 totes worth investing in. She advises buying an unusual skin which is likely to make it more desirable at auction.\nBuyers should choose 'exceptional skins like crocodile or unusual colours' which make them a piece no one else has and adds to the allure.\nA red lizard-skin vintage Kelly sold at the Artcurial auction last week went for 23,500 euros (£17,800) and a 28cm red crocodile-skin Kelly went for 38,500 euros (£29,200). An orange Togo leather version can be bought for a slightly more affordable £6,730 from second-hand site Collector Square.\nThe bag, which takes around 18 hours to make, was made popular by Monaco monarch Grace Kelly - who it is now named after.\nThe Kelly was created in the Thirties but a pregnant Princess Grace Kelly used different versions of the bag to hide her stomach and attempt to conceal her condition from the media.\nCHANEL 2.55\nThe Chanel 2.55 is a classic and Penelope advises choosing it because it's 'reinvented every year' so gives a great opportunity to buy unusual fabrics. She particularly recommends the jersey versions as they are rarer, while a navy leather version costs £2,024 from Vestaire Collection\nThe Chanel 2.55 bag was created in the 1920s when Coco Chanel became tired of having to carry her handbags in her arms, Alexa Chung is a fan of the classic, pictured with a velvet version in April, in California\nBecause the Chanel 2.55 is 'reinvented every year', it gives a great opportunity to buy unusual fabrics, according to Penelope.\nShe recommends the jersey versions as they are rarer, while a navy leather version costs £2,024 from Vestaire Collection.\nThe bag was created in the 1920s when Coco Chanel became tired of having to carry her handbags in her arms and decided to design a handbag that freed up her hands. Inspired by the straps found on soldiers’ bags, she added thin straps and introduced the resulting design to the market in 1929.\nAfter her successful comeback to the fashion industry in 1954, Chanel decided to update her handbag. The resulting design was called 2.55 after the date it was created, February 1955.\nWhen Karl Lagerfeld took over as creative director in 1983 he reissued the bag in its original design but added the turning 'CC' clasp.\nOn average, Chanel increases its prices from 8 to 12 per cent each year, so a bag bought now could potentially increase in value by more than 30 per cent in a short time frame.\nIn the past five years, the prices have increased by more than 50 per cent,.\nCELINE LUGGAGE PHANTOM\nA medium-sized nubuck version of the Luggage Phantom costs £1,750 from Celine. The price has also increased steadily, with the last increase 2014, so Penelope recommends it as another which will be a good investment\nKylie Jenner wears her Celine Luggage Phantom in June in Los Angeles, pictured with pal Pia Mia, she chose a green striped version of the bag\nAlthough a classic design in appearance, this Celine bag was created in 2010 and wasn't immediately a huge hit.\nBut in recent years it has been a firm favourite with regular waiting lists, a medium-sized nubuck version costs £1,750 from Celine.\nThe price has also increased steadily, with the last increase 2014, so Penelope recommends it as another which will be a good investment.\nCeline doesn't have its own e-commerce site, and Penelope says luxury brands without online retail outlets often preserve their resale value more than those that are available at the click of a button.\nBALENCIAGA CITY CLASSIC\nA classic metallic-edge city bag costs £1,195 from Balenciaga, the unstructured design is a classic\nActress Rooney Mara carries the Balenciaga City bag in a classic black in New York, the style wasn't a hit with Balenciaga bosses but is loved by models like Kate Moss\nCreated by Nicholas Ghesquire when he was creative director in the 1990s, it was a hard sell to get the bag made.\nThe company didn't like how the style wasn't 'rigid' but Ghesquire persuaded the company to create the bag for a catwalk show.\nModels who carried them down the catwalk fell head over heels and a select few who Ghesquire sent the bag out to, including Kate Moss, were equally enthralled.\nThe unstructured design has since became a classic. A classic metallic-edge city bag costs £1,195 from Balenciaga.\nLOUIS VUITTON SAC PLAT\nThe Louis Vuitton Sac Plat, costing £760, is on the lower end of investment pieces price wise but Penelope believes it will continue to be a solid investment\nAngelina Jolie uses a Louis Vuitton Sac Plat during a visit to Germany, 2011, the sharp shape complemented her black ensemble\nThe Sac Plat which translates to 'flat bag' has been around decades after it was first created in the 1980s.\nAnother fail-safe on Penelope's list, this is on the lower end of investment pieces price wise costing £760 from Louis Vuitton.\nThe simple shape and big name make it one Penelope predicts will continue to do well at auctions and with second-hand buyers in the future.\nBut she also emphasised it's important to buy a bag in 'good condition' so it will keep and increase its value.\nPenelope said their clients 'don't want it to look used, because they don't need it, they've just fallen in love with a model.'\nYVES SAINT LAURENT BY HEDI SLIMANE SAC DE JOUR\nThe bag, on sale at Forward by Elyse Walker for £2,299, had its last price increase in Spring 2015, a good sign that demand is increasing\nRosie Huntington-Whitely wears the Sac De Jour on an outing with fiance Jason Statham, she chose a dark-green shade and added a pom pom for a fun touch\nThe Sac de Jour, which is a new kid on the block in comparison to others Penelope recommended, was first created in 2013.\nBut its Birkin-esque shape made it a mainstay with four varying sizes available.\nThe bag, on sale at Forward by Elyse Walker for £2,299, had its last price increase in Spring 2015, a good sign that demand is increasing.\nPenelope has found that auction and second-hand consumption has boomed since waiting lists for many bags have increased, but also it's a new way to buy.\nAlthough classic shapes are important, vibrant colours are a must as clients are likely to want different colour bags 'to match them with their clothes.'\nGUCCI JACKIE\nGucci renamed the 1950s Constance bag after Jackie Onassis when she was regularly seen spotted with the Gucci bag throughout the 1960s, the Jackie costs £1,670, left, Penelope also chose the Veneta by Bottega Veneta with the brand's hallmark lattice effect, right, costs £1,965, from Net-A-Porter\nThe Jackie bag is another which is constantly reinvented.\nThe Italian fashion house renamed the 1950s Constance bag after Jackie Onassis when she was regularly seen spotted with the Gucci bag throughout the 1960s.\nThe bag was reinvented in 2009 with a modern deconstructed design - but it still took over eight hours to make each one. A Jackie soft-suede hobo, with green and red detail,costs £1,670 from Gucci.\nBOTTEGA VENETA VENETA\nSimilar to the Jackie in shape, Penelope chose another classic bag the Veneta which has a simple design and the brand's hallmark lattice effect, a Veneta costs £1,965 from Net-A-Porter.\nThe plaited effect is created using Intrecciato, a technique invented by Bottega Veneta in the 1960s to make the thin leather used in the workshops stronger and more durable for accessories.\nBottega Veneta designer Tomas Maier may have once called the It Bag 'totally marketed bulls***' but this design has endured with Penelope including it in her picks.\nIt's a simple bag which doesn't shout about the brand which makes it a popular piece with those buying at auction not wanting to appear flashy.\nBut Penelope believes the reason designer bags continue to increase in value is because people want the 'status symbol.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3409092/Expert-reveals-10-timeless-designer-totes-splash-looking-MAKE-money.html"}
