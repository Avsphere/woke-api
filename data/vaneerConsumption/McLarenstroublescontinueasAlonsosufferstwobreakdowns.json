Our afternoon run plan now resumes. #F1Testing pic.twitter.com/axZJuuuuIw — McLaren (@McLarenF1) March 10, 2017\nFormer world champion Sebastian Vettel had set the best time of testing so far on Thursday with a lap of one minute 19.024 seconds, but on Friday morning he was usurped by Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe Finn posted a best time of 1:18.634 to top the morning session, but had concentrated on race simulations after lunch before his Ferrari broke down in the chicane.\nAll parked up! 👍 @Max33Verstappen finishes the final test with 71 laps and a best time of 1:19.438 Next up: #AusGP 🇦🇺 #F1Testing #Red13ull pic.twitter.com/vHIt4XXZG9 — Red Bull Racing (@redbullracing) March 10, 2017\nSecond quickest in the morning was Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in 1:19.438, but his afternoon track time was restricted as his team battled with an issue with the car’s turbocharger.\nCarlos Sainz set a surprise third best time in the morning in the Toro Rosso and he lowered that to 1:19.837 before he too encountered problems and stopped on track late in the afternoon.\nRomain Grosjean had an eventful morning session as he lost the rear end of his Haas and ended up in the gravel and later stopped on the back straight, his two red flags sandwiching those of Alonso.\nSadly a water leak means we won't be back out today with @RGrosjean. He ends the day with 76 laps logged and a best time of 1:21.110. #F1 — Haas F1 Team (@HaasF1Team) March 10, 2017\nNew Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas’ 1:19.845 was good enough for fourth ahead of his team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who took over duties after lunch, the Renault of Nico Hulkenburg and Force India’s Sergio Perez.\nJolyon Palmer was making the most of Renault solving their reliability issues to post the eighth best time ahead of Canadian Lance Stroll, the Formula 3 champion putting his recent crash spree behind him to clock up over 100 laps for Williams.\nAlonso, Grosjean and Sauber duo Marcus Ericsson and Pascal Wehrlein rounded out the timesheets.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4301290/McLaren-misery-continues-Barcelona-testing.html"}
