The middle school level scored 87.5 points, up from 87.1 and the elementary schools scored an average of 84.8, up from 82.8.\nVIEW GEORGIA'S 2016 CCRPI SCORES\nThe Governor’s Office of Student Achievement has set 90 points as the threshold for the top level of performance on the 0 to 100 point CCRPI (and it's possible to earn another 10 extra credit points. The scores above do not inlcude extra credit.) Decatur High School got an “A.”\nA score of 80-89 earns a “B,” which is where Renfroe Middle Schools and the elementary schools, on average, landed.\nSchools get points for performance on a variety of measures, including graduation and attendance rates, STEM certification, inclusion of students with disabilities in general classrooms or participation in accelerated classes like Advanced Placement. By far the most important measure, though, is performance on state standardized tests, currently the Georgia Milestones.\nSee the results at the state education department’s website.\nYou can find information about your school, such as test scores, graduation rates and school climate rating at the Ultimate Atlanta School Guide.\nRELATED: How did DeKalb County schools perform on state’s report card?","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/scores-rise-decatur-state-schools-report-card/g1sf2azPs1q7ihHsvQaJcL/"}
