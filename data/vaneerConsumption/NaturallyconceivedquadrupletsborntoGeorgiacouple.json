But she’s the first to give birth to quadruplets.\nOn Friday, Miller and her husband, Justin, welcomed four babies: Brandon, Brayden, Bryant and sister Kenlee.\n“I am doing so much better now that they are here,” Miller said in a hospital news release.\nDelivered at 29 weeks, each weighed around 3 pounds. The babies were conceived naturally, a one in 700,000 chance, according to Piedmont Newnan Hospital, where the babies were delivered.\nKortney and Justin Miller also have a 4-year-old son, Bentlee.\n“Things could not have gone better,” said Adegboyega Aderibigbe, a Piedmont neonatologist. “Everyone knew what to expect. When the day arrived, we had a few hours’ notice and everything went smoothly, thanks to the ‘quad squad’s’ teamwork.”\nThe hospital’s “quad squad” started planning for the babies’ arrival months earlier when Miller was about four months along.\nHeather Turner, an OB-GYN at the hospital, delivered the babies via cesarean section. Turner previously delivered the couple’s 4-year-old son, Bentlee.\n“We are so excited and blessed to have four healthy babies,”\nMiller said.\nThe family was planning to leave the hospital and head home on Tuesday.\nPlease return to AJC.com for updates.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/naturally-conceived-quadruplets-born-georgia-couple/ikyf2FLCFpfXaGbACMxUIJ/"}
