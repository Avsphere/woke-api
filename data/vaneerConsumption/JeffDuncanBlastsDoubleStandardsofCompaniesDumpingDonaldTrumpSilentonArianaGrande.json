He said he was “curious” why the same companies didn’t weigh in after Grande said she “hates Americans” and “hates America” during a recent visit to a doughnut shop.\n“Just curious: where are the NBC’s, Univisions, ESPN’s, record labels, concert venues, etc in this Ariana Grande incident?” Duncan wrote. “They were mighty quick to jump on the ‘bash Donald Trump’ bandwagon when he spoke about illegal aliens and ‘sanctuary city’ policies.”\n“This misguided young pop singer said that she hated America and hated Americans, while she proceeded to contaminate food for resale with the very tongue with which she uttered the hatred rant.”\n“The double-standards in this country are disgusting,” the lawmaker concluded.\nThe Riverside County Sheriff’s Department announced Monday it would not charge Grande with a crime after doughnut shop owner Joe Marin declined to pursue charges against the pop singer.\nMeanwhile, companies and high-profile individuals continue to cut ties with Trump as he has gained momentum on the campaign trail and in national polling. Last week, celebrity chef Jose Andres became the latest individual to cut ties with the candidate when he backed out of opening his flagship restaurant in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington DC.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/13/jeff-duncan-blasts-double-standards-of-companies-dumping-donald-trump/"}
