KCRA notes that it was the first time the spillway had been opened in two decades. The water will enter the Tuolomne River, which in turn feeds into the San Joaquin River itself.\nElsewhere, as frantic efforts to prevent a spillway collapse at the Oroville Dam continue, officials succeeded in their goal of lowering the level of Lake Oroville by 50 feet on Monday. The lake, which reached and surpassed its maximum height of 901 feet above sea level last Sunday, dropped 50 feet below that point on Monday morning, according to the Redding Record Searchlight.\nRain is forecast for the region through Wednesday.\nTrevor Hughes, writing in the USA Today, notes the political rift exposed by the ongoing crisis:\nIt’s a refrain voiced time and again in Oroville and the surrounding towns: The liberal, more populated parts of California suck up all the political attention and public dollars, leaving little for the men and women who help grow the nation’s food, fruits and nuts. That dichotomy has bred a mistrust of state government and a healthy skepticism of federal officials, [President Donald] Trump excepted.\nCalifornia Democrats have been faulted for spending money, including billions in federal stimulus funds under President Barack Obama, on social welfare priorities rather than dam and water infrastructure.\nJoel B.
