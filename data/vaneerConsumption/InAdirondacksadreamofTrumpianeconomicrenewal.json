He says Trump is doing an \"excellent\" job so far, praising his border and economic policies.\n\"I think he is right on track -- even though he has a long way to go,\" said the father of three, citing as proof the recent Wall Street bounce.\nAnd while Republican mayor Bruce Lyon laments that Trump sometimes speaks \"before his brain has time to work,\" he says he's sure the commander-in-chief \"really wants to keep as many jobs in the US as he can.\"\nLyon, 75, says the closure of the slipper factory was \"devastating.\"\nLeft behind are just five or six companies that employ several hundred people in a town of 2,400 residents.\n\"But 300, 400 jobs is more than we would have if they all left... if we can keep things like that safe...\" Lyon trailed off.\nSmall towns like Dolgeville, he says, are in \"dire need\" of the $1 trillion Trump has promised to spend on America's exhausted infrastructure -- like the bridge that links the two parts of town, split by the East Canada Creek.\nLike others, he complains about a lack of support from Democratic New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo, accusing him of doing more to look after the large metropolitan centers that elected him.\n- Dream a dream -\nDolgeville, New York, at the foot of the Adirondack Mountains, has only a handful of employers left, like this baseball factory, but saw hope in voting for Donald Trump\nWayne Dzierzanoski, who has worked for 18 years at the Rawlings baseball bat factory, wants to see the new owners, conglomerate Rubbermaid, branch out and repatriate other production operations that it has overseas.\nHe says he doesn't regret bringing up his two daughters in the area of lakes and maple trees, which are drilled at this time of year to harvest syrup.\nCrime rates are low and when it comes to talk of immigrants, many think first of members of the Amish community who for years have come to erect barns.\nBut like many, Dzierzanoski, 61, says he hopes Dolgeville will get new opportunities thanks to Trump's promised industrial renewal.\n\"There is such a cultural dichotomy between New York City and here -- too many people are caught up with what they are doing to really pay attention to what's going on outside,\" he said.\nIt seems everyone has their own dream.\nWaitress Tina Gorinshek, 53, hopes that the Trump years will bring back shops like \"25 years ago\" when she could \"walk up Main Street and do all my Christmas shopping.\"\nFor Lyon, it's the dream of reviving the imposing gray building that used to house the Daniel Green slipper factory, which is up for sale.\n\"If Donald Trump could see something like this and come up with an idea of what we could do... Maybe we can get it back up!\" he says.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4300412/In-Adirondacks-dream-Trumpian-economic-renewal.html"}
