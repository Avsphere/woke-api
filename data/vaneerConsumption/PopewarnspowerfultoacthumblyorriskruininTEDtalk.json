So please, think of me as well with tenderness so that I can fulfill the task that I have been given for the good of the other - of each and every one. Of all of you, of all of us.'\nFrancis also pleaded for greater solidarity to be considered in political, economic and scientific endeavors.\nHe said that technological innovation is fine, but not when it blinds society to the people suffering around us.\n'How wonderful would it be, while we discover faraway planets, to rediscover the needs of the brothers and sisters orbiting around us,' he said.\n'How wonderful would it be if solidarity - this beautiful and sometimes inconvenient word - were not simply reduced to social work and became instead the default attitude in political, economic and scientific choices.'\nThe Pope added that he liked the title of the TED conference, because it opens up a dialogue about the future.\nBut he also said that we can only achieve our goals by working together.\n'Quite a few years of life have strengthened my conviction that each and everyone's existence is deeply tied to that of others,' Francis said. 'Life is not time merely passing by, life is about interactions.'\nThe Pope added that he liked the title of the TED conference, because it opens up a dialogue about the future\nDespite having 10million Twitter followers on Twitter, the 80-year-old churchman warned that technological innovation could blind people to the suffering around them\nThe Pope said he often thinks about his grandparents - migrants from Italy who moved to Argentina.\nHe said he wonders how they would have fared among the 'culture of waste' in today's unforgiving world.\n'I could have very well ended up among today's 'discarded' people. And that's why I always ask myself, deep in my heart: 'Why them and not me?''\nHe continued: 'A single individual is enough for hope to exist, and that individual can be you. And then there will be another 'you,' and another 'you,' and it turns into an 'us.'\n'And so, does hope begin when we have an 'us?' No. Hope began with one 'you.' When there is an 'us,' there begins a revolution.'\nTED, short for Technology, Entertainment and Design, organizes conferences around the world aiming to spread ideas through short talks.\nFrancis' participation in the TED conference marked a new era for the Vatican's communications operation, which has increasingly sought to get the pope's message out via social media and nontraditional news sources.\nIn the video, released by the Vatican on Wednesday, took more than a year of convincing.\nBruno Giusanni, TED's international curator, coaxed Francis into recording a talk - viewing him as a 'moral voice' with a clear message.\n'In this complicated and often confusing world, Pope Francis has become possibly the only moral voice capable of reaching people across boundaries and providing clarity and a compelling message of hope,' he told CNN.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447818/Pope-warns-powerful-act-humbly-risk-ruin-TED-talk.html"}
