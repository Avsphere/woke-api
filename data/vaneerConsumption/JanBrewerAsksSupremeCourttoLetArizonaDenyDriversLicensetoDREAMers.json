Brewer “announced her ban on driver’s licenses on Aug. 15, 2012, the day deferred action took effect.”\nIf the Supreme Court does not intervene, “U.S. District Judge David Campbell in Phoenix can issue an injunction that would require the Arizona Department of Transportation to issue driver’s licenses” to DREAMers as early as next week.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2014/12/11/az-gov-brewer-asks-supreme-court-to-allow-state-to-deny-driver-s-license-to-dreamers/"}
