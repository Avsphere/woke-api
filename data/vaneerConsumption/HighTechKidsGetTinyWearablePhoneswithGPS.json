FiLIP also lets parents talk to and track their kids, using a touchscreen instead of voice recognition. (It can also accept text messages).\nSadly, the retail price won't include voice plans. Tinitell recommends pre-paid plans, just in case Timmy is tempted to spend hours on the phone talking about Spider-Man.\nWhile it's mainly being marketed to kids, the company noted that Tinitell could \"appeal to grown-ups seeking a basic wristphone for rugged outdoor activities.\" Remember to add that to your list, lumberjacks: leather boots, ax and a child-sized, aqua-colored wristband.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/gift-guide/high-tech-kids-get-tiny-wearable-phones-gps-n99616"}
