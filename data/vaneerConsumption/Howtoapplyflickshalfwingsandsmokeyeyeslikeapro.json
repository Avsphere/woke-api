Research by Max Factor revealed that a third of women cited eyeliner as their number one make-up struggle.\nCaroline Barnes, a Max Factor make-up artist, says: ‘Eyeliner can completely transform the shape of your eyes. A fully lined eye with a flick at the corner creates length, while a half-wing - from the middle to the outer corner - can lift and widen the eyes.’\nOne of my tricks to master straight eyeliner is to apply mascara first, then you can draw on short strokes or even tiny dots to join together, instead of trying to create one continuous line.\nGetting eyeliner right isn’t as easy as it looks - for a third of women it's their number one make-up struggle\nChoosing the right products helps, but so can the right tools. Real Techniques Collector’s Edition Eyelining Set by Sam and Nic Chapman (£12.49, amazon.co.uk) includes four brilliant brushes for gel or powder liners.\nThe precision liner brush is thin and delicate while the smudge brush blends harsh lines - you can use it with powder for a smokey-eye look.\nNic says: ‘The brush with the angled head is perfect for beginners. Add powder shadow and apply it along the bottom lash line creating a flick by continuing the shape of your eye.’\nBobbi Brown favours double lining to make eyes stand out. She advises applying her Long Wear Gel Eyeliner (£18.50, johnlewis.com) along the top lash line and then, before it dries, adding a smudge of shadow on top.\nThis will give the eyes extra definition and make the colour last longer. I love the gel eyeliner shade Patina Ink (£18.50, bobbibrown.co.uk) - the golden brown colour is very flattering.\nBeauty Coach and make-up expert Lina Cameron advises enhancing the shape of your eyes with a soft waterproof liner, such as Estee Lauder Little Black Liner (£22, johnlewis.com).\nDot this into the roots of the upper lashes, ‘then trace with a stroke of eyeshadow,’ she says.\n‘Apply a powder shadow under the lower lashes for a soft, smudged finish. To widen the eyes, eyelash curlers are a must.’\nBEST EYELINER PENS\nMax Factor Masterpiece High Precision Liquid Liner (£5.99, was £7.99, superdrug.com )\nMax Factor Masterpiece High Precision Liquid Liner\n(£5.99, was £7.99, superdrug.com)\nThis is a precise and intense liquid liner, so it’s easy to get a perfect line and flick. If it’s too fine, you can use its thicker nibs to create a more dramatic look.\nClarins 3-Dot Liner (£21, clarins.co.uk )\nSeventeen Make Your Mark Liner (£3.99, boots.com )\nClarins 3-Dot Liner\n(£21, clarins.co.uk)\nIdeal for beginners, you can apply three dots at once with this liner. Smudge them together or connect with small lines for a flawless finish.\nSeventeen Make Your Mark Liner\n(£3.99, boots.com)\nThis is like a fat felt-tip pen, but it’s surprisingly precise. Press a metallic grey or purple eyeshadow on top of the liner for a look that will last all evening.\nMAC Fluidline Eyeliner (£16, maccosmetics.co.uk\nYSL Shocking False Lash Effect Eyeliner (£25.50, yslbeauty.co.uk )\nMAC Fluidline Eyeliner\n(£16, maccosmetics.co.uk)\nQuick and easy to apply, this gel make-up rapidly dries to a matte finish. As a bonus, it comes in a navy blue and sea green as well as black.\nYSL Shocking False Lash Effect Eyeliner\n(£25.50, yslbeauty.co.uk)\nIf you want a Sixties-style flick, this is the pen for you. The tip is so fine you could use it to sign your name. It also comes in blue and green shades.\nSmart Beauty Express Colour (£6.99, superdrug.com)\nUNSUNG HERO\nSmart Beauty Express Colour (£6.99, superdrug.com) is a new, at-home hair colorant that blends greys and contains no ammonia, peroxide or Paraphenylenediamine, a chemical widely used in dye. It works in three minutes, or you can leave it on for a more intense colour. One tub will do your whole head and the colour will last for up to five washes.\nThe W7 Genius Feather Light Foundation (£5.50, naturalbeautyslimming.com)\nBARGAIN BUY\nThe W7 Genius Feather Light Foundation (£5.50, naturalbeautyslimming.com) comes in five shades and is so light you hardly know you’re wearing it. The coverage is consistent, giving you a smooth complexion, and there’s no messing around with clogged pumps, just use the applicator to dot a few drops on a make-up sponge.\nEight-Hour All-Over Miracle Oil (£29, elizabetharden.co.uk)\nELSA'S PICK\nFor anyone who loves Elizabeth Arden’s Eight-Hour Cream, the Eight-Hour All-Over Miracle Oil (£29, elizabetharden.co.uk) will be a treat. The formula can be used on the face, body and hair, and uses Tsubaki oil to combat wrinkles, lines and dehydrated skin, leaving it radiant.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3392890/Eyeliner-masterclass-apply-flicks-half-wings-smokey-eyes-like-pro.html"}
