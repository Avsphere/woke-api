They’d better watch out, because another the Riverdance wedding party may have just stolen their crown for Best Wedding Reception Performance in the History of the Universe. Irish stepdancers Michael O’Meara and Nikki Mac Loone recently said their “I do’s” — which, of course, led to one heck of a dance floor routine by the happy couple and their guests during the reception. In case you've ever wondered what happens when Riverdance rs get married... this is it.\nThe groom’s brother, JP O’Meara, posted the video to his Facebook page on August 3; he remarked in the comments that Michael and Nikki tied the knot on Friday, August 1. Since then, the post has been shared over 5,500 times — and it’s easy to see why. According to Irish Central, both the bride and groom are, in fact, former Riverdance and Lord of the Dance cast members; additionally, a huge number of their friends are also professional dancers. When you get that many pros together at a huge joyous gather… well, let’s just say amazing things happen. I’m not sure whether the routine was planned and rehearsed or whether it was an impromptu performance, but either way, it’s all kinds of awesome.\nCheck it out below — and pay extra close attention at the 2:15 mark, when the bride picks up her voluminous skirts and joins in. The fact that she kicked up her heels not only in a wedding dress, but in a mermaid gown — y’know, the type that pins your knees together — is nothing short of astonishing.\nPost by Jp O Meara.\nLike many girls who grew up in the ‘90s, I was mildly obsessed with Riverdance for a good couple of years. I never got round to actually learning how to stepdance, but I kind of wish I had — now more than ever. Is it too late to teach an old dog new tricks?","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35606-this-riverdance-wedding-reception-performance-wins-the-internet-today"}
