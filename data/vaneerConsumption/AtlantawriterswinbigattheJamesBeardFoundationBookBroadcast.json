It was on Apalachicola oysters. I have been writing about food on and off for 20 years, and it means the world to have my work acknowledged by my peers. For a kid who grew up on a peanut farm in South Georgia this is huge. Christiane Lauterbach is an Atlanta treasure, and it was a gift to tell her story.\"\nLauterbach, who resides in Atlanta and publishes monthly dining newsletter Knife & Fork, said being the subject of an award-winning story was \"a bit weird, because my entire career has been based on creeping in the shadows.\" Yet Lauterbach stated she was \"thrilled\" with Brock's award.\n\"It would not have been as good a piece if Wendell had not known me as a person and put so much energy into following me around,\" she said.\nMiller Union chef Steven Satterfield's first cookbook “Root to Leaf” was a finalist in the photography category, but lost out to \"Near & Far: Recipes Inspired by Home and Travel\" by Heidi Swanson. Satterfield's book was also nominated for a Julia Child First Book Award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals .\nThe James Beard Foundation Awards Restaurant and Chef winners will be announced at a ceremony Monday, May 2 in Chicago. There are three Atlanta finalists : Satterfield and Gunshow chef Kevin Gillespie are both up for Best Chef: Southeast, and Old Fourth Ward spot Staplehouse is up for Best New Restaurant. In addition, Sean Brock, who opened his first Atlanta restaurant with Minero in Ponce City Market last fall , was named a finalist in the Outstanding Chef category.\nIf you're interested in getting a taste of Willis' food, meal kit delivery service PeachDish has added her Smothered & Covered Chicken dish back into their menu offerings in celebration of her win. It's live on their site now, and will be available for delivery from May 2-23.\nA complete list of winners of the James Beard Foundation Book, Broadcast and Journalism awards is available here.\nMore recent food writing from Wendell Brock:\nThe Varsity: Where memories (and chili dogs) are made\nBest brunch dishes in Atlanta\nHow to make a Cinco de Mayo fiesta\nGive the Colonnade credit for not messing with classics\nPerfect egg recipes with a twist\nVirginia Willis recipes:\nChicken Divan\nSweet Tea-Brined Pork Blade Steaks with Grilled Onions and Sherry Vinegar\nClick here to read the AJC’s Ultimate Guide to Brunch in Atlanta\nClick here to read about dining in Atlanta around the clock\nRead more stories like this by liking Atlanta Restaurant Scene on Facebook, following @ATLDiningNews on Twitter and @ajcdining on Instagram.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/atlanta-restaurants/atlanta-writers-win-big-the-james-beard-foundation-book-broadcast-and-journalism-awards/44pnY7HqVw1jYZmPzhtvjI/"}
