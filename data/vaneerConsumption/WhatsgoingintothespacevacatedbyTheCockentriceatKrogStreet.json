We began looking at those inquiries because we knew we didn’t want this to be empty for long,” said Merritt Lancaster a Principal of Paces Properties, which operates Krog Street Market, in a release. “Federico (Castellucci, president of the restaurant group) and his team had reached out some time ago, but we didn’t have any anchor restaurant opportunities at that time. They connected with us again and thus timing is everything.”\nThe Castellucci Group's most recent project was the September move of its restaurant Double Zero to Emory Village from Sandy Springs.\nKrog Street Market is also set to see the opening of Suzy Siu's Baos this month.\nRead The A List: The faces, places, dishes and drinks defining the Atlanta dining scene right now","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/atlanta-restaurants/what-going-into-the-space-vacated-the-cockentrice-krog-street-market/wmQgNpFTrrGx5Gyf9F4qFP/"}
