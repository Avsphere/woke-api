The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nCuba announced it has arrested four Miami-based Cuban exiles suspected of planning attacks on military installations to promote anti-government violence.\nIn a statement late Tuesday, Cuba's interior ministry labeled the suspects as terrorists. The government is linking the four men to Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile and former CIA operative living in Miami who is wanted in Cuba and Venezuela over the bombing of a Cubana Airlines jet in 1976 that killed 73 people.\nThe four suspects were identified as Jose Ortega Amador, Obdulio Rodriguez Gonzalez, Raibel Pacheco Santos and Felix Monzon Alvarez.\nCuba said it would contact U.S. officials about the investigation, and said the four admitted to planning the attacks. Three of them had been traveling about the island since the middle of 2013 to plan its execution, according to the interior ministry statement published in official media.\nOn Wednesday afternoon the State Department said Cuba had not been in touch regarding the arrests and said they did not have details on the incident.\n-- Reuters and NBC's Catherine Chomiak contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/cuba-arrests-four-miami-based-exiles-accused-planning-attacks-n99361"}
