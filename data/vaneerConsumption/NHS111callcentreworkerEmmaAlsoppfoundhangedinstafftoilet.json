But I promise to bear that pain every single day (sic). You will not be forgotten.'\nThe 22-year-old had complained to family and friends about the pressures of her job at the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust's (SWASFT) West Hub office in Exeter in the weeks before her death\nA bombshell NHS England report this week concluded that 111 advisers required better training in spotting when there was a need to probe further into callers' ailments and when to escalate cases.\nThe service has since been slammed by critics as being unsafe for seriously ill children, with many voicing concerns that box-ticking process used by operators can miss life-threatening symptoms.\nIt was published in the wake of one-year-old William Mead's death from sepsis.\nIt stated that the tot may have been alive today had a 111 call handler realised just how ill he was.\nThe Exeter call centre (pictured) is the sister of the Dorset helpline where Melissa and Paul Mead's concerns about their gravely ill son William were overlooked\nMelissa and Paul Mead's only child died as a result of a catalogue of errors and missed opportunities by both doctors and the helpline.\nAlthough he had been ill for three months, vital warning signs were missed when the couple called the Dorset helpline - sister of the Devon call centre Ms Alsopp was an employee of.\nThe report into William's death established that there were a staggering 16 failures in his care, each one of them contributing to his final fatal illness.\nWithout proper diagnosis, William developed pneumonia, and fluid and an abscess on his lung, which led to his death from sepsis.\nA bombshell report into the NHS out-of-hours hotline this week slammed the service as being unsafe for seriously ill children. It was published in the wake of one-year-old William Mead's death from sepsis, It stated that the tot (pictured) may have been alive today had a 111 call handler realised just how ill he was\nMrs Mead said: ‘I will never come to terms with what happened.
