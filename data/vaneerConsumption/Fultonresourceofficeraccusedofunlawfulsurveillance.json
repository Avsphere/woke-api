In addition to working at the high school, police say Rucker is also the executive director of the Quick Silver Track Club in Fulton County.\nPolice were originally investigating accusations of child exploitation and molestation against Rucker and found the electronics during that investigation. The equipment may have been used to record people in the home, between 2008 and the present, without their consent, according to the release.\nThe files are being reviewed by the Secret Service because many of the people in the recordings have not been identified. Once the people are identified, Rucker likely will face additional charges.\nAnyone who thinks they may have been victimized by Rucker should call Fulton County police at 404-613-6600.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/fulton-resource-officer-accused-unlawful-surveillance/bV2iFrAZoQL8FApAXKJ8kO/"}
