You can imagine, as a student, going to school knowing others might possess pictures of you when you only intended one person to have them,' he said.\n'It can be devastating on your psyche and you don't know what can happen afterward. Peer pressure is hard enough in high school.'\nJoseph Erardi, superintendent of public schools in Newtown, said: 'I think the difficult lesson learned to all students is that every key stroke you're putting forward on technology, you own that for a lifetime.'\nThe three charged students will appear at Danbury Juvenile Court in February.\nNewtown High School teaches around 1,800 students in grades nine to 12 and was attended by Caitlyn Jenner in the 1960s.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421124/Three-high-school-students-arrested-child-porn-charges-selling-explicit-pictures-classmates-10-each.html"}
