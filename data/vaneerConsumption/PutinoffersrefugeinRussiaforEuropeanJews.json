Putin has long been known to oppose anti-Semitism, and violent attacks against Jews in his country have in fact been on the decline in recent years. He also conducts warm relations with Israel – even as he does the same with Iran.\nThe new law is not at all in the American tradition of freedom of religion, to say the least. But it may be taken as evidence by some as to Putin’s intentions.\nThe one thing that must be stated is that unlike Western Europe (and many in the United States), Russia is willing to overtly defend the Western religious tradition.","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/01/putin_offers_refuge_in_russia_for_european_jews_.html"}
