It wasn't immediately clear whether any of them were arrested and charged.\nTicoalu said organizers received reports already in 2014 of groups of young men and boys groping girls in a systematic manner. Efforts were put in place, including more security guards, to prevent a repeat in 2015 but instead the problem got worse, he said.\n\"We've always had individual cases\" of sexual assault, he said. \"But here we have a larger group doing it almost in an organized way. It's a completely new level of obscenity.\"\n\"You have a large group of boys surrounding the girls,\" he said. \"They pretend to dance. They come closer and closer. Then they start touching their breasts and genitals. In some cases in combination with theft.\"\nTicoalu said organizers had discussed the problem on Swedish Radio before last year's festival but didn't alert the public to the incidents taking place once the festival got underway.\n\"Of course you can say we should have,\" he said. \"But during this period we had 170,000 visitors in five days. So the situation wasn't judged as something where the public needed to be informed.\"\nDagens Nyheter cited police officials saying Swedish police are reluctant to speak publicly about crimes linked to migrants for fear of playing into the hands of the far-right Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigration party whose support has surged to about 20 percent in opinion polls.\nPoliticians of all stripes said it was unacceptable for police to withhold information due to political concerns.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3393724/Swedish-police-accused-covering-sex-crimes-festival.html"}
