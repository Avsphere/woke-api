Asa Hutchinson says he wants lawmakers to end the state's practice of commemorating Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on the same day.\nThe Republican told reporters Wednesday that, when the Legislature meets for its regular session next year, it should give King his own holiday. Arkansas is one of three states to jointly celebrate King and Lee on the third Monday in January.\nProposals to end the joint holiday failed multiple times before a House panel last year after opponents said the separation would belittle Southern heritage. Hutchinson said King deserves the holiday to himself to commemorate his role in the civil-rights movement.\nRead Thursday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/jan/06/arkansas-governor-remove-robert-e-lee-king-holiday/?page=3"}
