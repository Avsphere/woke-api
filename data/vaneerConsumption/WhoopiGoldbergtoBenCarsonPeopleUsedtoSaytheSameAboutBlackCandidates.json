Also keep in mind, Ben Carson, that’s what they used to say about black candidates. That’s what they said about Shirley Chisholm, she was black and a woman. They went to town on her. I think the person who is run something how they have to look at them. That’s like saying no Jewish person should be president.Why would you do that.”\nCo-host Raven-Symoné added, “If I’m looking at candidates and they are showing blatant racism, why would you think I’m going to vote for you?”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/09/21/whoopi-goldberg-to-ben-carson-people-used-to-say-the-same-about-black-candidates/"}
