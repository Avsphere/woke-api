The wiretapping has been discussed in The New York Times, BBC, Fox News and we believe that it should be looked at by the House Intelligence Committee.”\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/03/06/wh-spox-on-if-trump-accepts-comey-denial-on-obama-wiretapping-i-dont-think-he-does/"}
