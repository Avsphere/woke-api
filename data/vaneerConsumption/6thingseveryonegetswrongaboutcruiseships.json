But it turns out that the way most cruise lines organize boarding and disembarkation pretty effectively limits crowds getting on and off the ship.\nInitial boarding as well as leaving the ship at the end of the cruise both take place over multi-hour windows. At ports of call, departure times for shore excursions tend to be staggered, which means most people exit the ship in small groups rather than big crowds.\nIf you're particularly claustrophobic, though, you may want to avoid itineraries that stop in ports where ships can't dock, since that will mean passengers need to be shuttled to the shore on small boats called tenders, a process which can slow disembarkation and allow lines to build up.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-ships-myths-2016-12"}
