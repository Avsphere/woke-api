Turkey had agreed to work to keep migrants from crossing into the EU in return for funds to help it deal with some 3 million refugees.\nErdogan accused the EU of not sticking with a promise to grant Turkish nationals the right to travel visa-free in Europe. He also sharply criticized a European court ruling in favor of curbs on wearing Islamic headscarves.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4320360/Turkey-threatens-end-migrant-deal-EU-amid-spat.html"}
