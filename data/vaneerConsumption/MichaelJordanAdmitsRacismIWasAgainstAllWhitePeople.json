The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nMichael Jordan didn't travel the easiest of roads en route to becoming a college basketball star and an NBA legend.\nAnd certain obstacles put a chip on his shoulder that, while it long since seems to have vanished, helped shape the athlete's drive and competitive spirit moving forward, according to \"Michael Jordan: The Life,\" a new biography about the six-time NBA champion by sportswriter Roland Lazenby that hit shelves Tuesday.\n\"I considered myself a racist at the time\"\nPer an excerpt from the book, Jordan told Lazenby that he was suspended from school in 1977 after throwing a soda at a girl who called him the N-word.\n\"So I threw a soda at her,\" Jordan's quoted as saying. \"I was really rebelling. I considered myself a racist at the time. Basically, I was against all white people.\"\nPHOTOS: 2014 NBA All-Star Game celeb sightings\nLazenby told Sports Illustrated that it appeared that the root of Jordan's animosity came from growing up in an area of North Carolina where the Ku Klux Klan once had a large presence.\n\"I've been to North Carolina hundreds of times and enjoy it tremendously, but North Carolina was a state that had more Klan members than the rest of the Southern states combined,\" the author said. \"As I started looking at newspapers back in this era when I was putting together [Michael's great-grandfather] Dawson Jordan's life, the Klan was like a chamber of commerce. It bought the uniforms for ball teams, it put Bibles in all the schools. It may well have ended up being a chamber of commerce if not for all the violence it was perpetrating, too. A lot of the context just wasn't possible to put it in a basketball book. A lot of it ended up being cut.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/michael-jordan-admits-racism-i-was-against-all-white-people-n98971"}
