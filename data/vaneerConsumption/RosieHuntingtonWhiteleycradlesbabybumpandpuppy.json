Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 29, was glowing as she cradled her growing baby bump with her arm around one of her beloved Dachshunds in her latest Instagram picture\nShe didn't add any caption to the photo, but did put an animal and smiley emoji.\nThe gorgeous blonde smiled demurely at the camera as she put both hands on her belly while relaxing on a comfy chair.\nWith her hair casually pulled back into a loose updo, she looked the epitome of relaxation with her trusty sidekick beside her.\nMeanwhile, finance Jason Statham, 50, recently stripped down to display his rippling muscles for the latest issue of Men's Health magazine.\nScroll down for video\nShirtless: Jason Statham has posed in just his bottoms for the latest issue of Men's Health magazine\nIn the accompanying interview, he told the publication of getting older: 'I’m moving better than I used to. I’m feeling pretty nimble. It’s about the whole thing: training, eating, sleeping... all of those have a massive impact on how you feel.\n'And I’m doing better at all of those things. Sly Stallone’s got 20 years on me and still looks good so he’s part of my inspiration.'\nA part of his fitness regime has included practising Brazilian jiu-jitsu with his film-maker pal Guy Ritchie - and they've been often quite competitive.\n'I remember when we started out, we’d go on a press tour for Lock, Stock… and we’d be moving all the furniture out of the way in the hotel room, trying to choke each other out,' recalled Jason.\nIn the accompanying interview, he told the publication of getting older: 'I’m moving better than I used to. I’m feeling pretty nimble. It’s about the whole thing: training, eating, sleeping... all of those have a massive impact on how you feel' - pictured in April 2015\nAnd while he's a celebrity himself, and counts a growing list of starry names among his list of pals, British actor Jason - who lives in California with Rosie - has been cautious about getting sucked in by the negative aspects of Hollywood.\n'Hollywood has a caustic effect on a lot of people,' he said. 'It’s a cruel business. You can get a big head about things. But what goes up must come down.'\nOn a more trivial level, part of his inclusion in Hollywood circles is having a 'hardman' image - which he insists couldn't be further from he truth.\nHe said: 'And I’m doing better at all of those things. Sly Stallone’s got 20 years on me and still looks good so he’s part of my inspiration'\nHe said in reaction: 'Ha! These public labels, the things the media like to paint you as, I don’t really look at them. I see myself as a pretty standard sort of chap, really.\n'I keep a lot of my pals close to me and I think that keeps my feet on the ground. I don’t know if they’ll say the same thing! But we all come from the same place.'\nThe full interview is available in the April 2017 issue of Men’s Health, on sale now.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4300222/Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-cradles-baby-bump-puppy.html"}
