He might be trying to, you know, scrub some of the brown off of his skin as he runs to the right, you know.”\n“He should have his facts on this and he doesn’t,” one CNN Political Commentator said in his false assertion that Jindal was incorrect on the “No-Go” zones.\nThe clip plays video of Jindal from a recent speech where he said: “We have got to insist on assimilation. Make no mistake, Immigration without assimilation, that’s not immigration. Immigration without assimilation is invasion.”\n“Bobby Jindal was right,” the video from the Governor’s campaign concludes.\nAs Breitbart Editor Joel Pollak wrote Monday, Jindal faced heavy criticism earlier in 2015 when he pointed out the dangers of the several Muslim “No-Go” zones emerging in Europe.\nIn fact, the French government has previously listed 750 areas determined as “Sensitive Urban Zones.”\nThe Swedish government, similarly, has listed 186 “exclusion areas,” described by a Swedish blogger as “crowded, predominantly Muslim immigrant ghettos, where education is low, employment is lower and the only local business thriving is drug dealings”\nBelgium and the Netherlands also have several known areas that can be commonly referred to as “no-go” zones, which boast a large Islamic population where police often struggle to enforce the country’s laws.\nSeparately, Gov. Jindal issued an executive order on Monday, titled, “Protecting Louisiana Amid Obama Administration Plans For Resettlement of Syrian Refugees,” which blocks the resettlement of Syrian refugees into Louisiana. He also ordered the Louisiana State Police to monitor any Syrian refugees already in the state for national security-related reasons.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/11/16/exclusive-bobby-jindal-right-muslim-no-go-zones/"}
