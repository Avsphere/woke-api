The four girls were aged between 14 and 16 at the time of the alleged abuse, according to a UN statement.\nThe French defence ministry said it had passed on the new information it had received from the United Nations to French investigators to allow them to establish whether they were different allegations from those already made.\n\"The United Nations and France are cooperating fully in order to shed all the light possible on these very serious allegations,\" the Le Drian aide said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3423142/France-probe-alleged-child-sex-abuse-soldiers-CAR.html"}
