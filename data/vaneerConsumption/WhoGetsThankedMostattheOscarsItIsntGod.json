Some of those deemed worthy of a share in all the success are mentioned much more than others.\nAhead of Sunday’s 87th annual Academy Awards, Vocativ combed through hours of previous years’ acceptance speeches to find out exactly who gets the most shoutouts, and the top ten list results may surprise you.\nOf the 1,396 acceptance speeches currently archived on the academy’s website, director Steven Spielberg takes the top spot, and has been thanked by eager winners a total of 42 times.\nA distant second, former Miramax founder and current Weinstein Company head Harvey Weinstein has been mentioned 34 times, while director James Cameron came to mind 28 times to take 3rd place.\nGeorge Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise and head of LucasFilm LTD, comes in at 4th, leaving producer/director “Sir” Peter Jackson, who directed the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, to take the 5th spot on the list.\nIn a largely secular industry, God comes in just outside of the top five, at 6th place, and has been thanked a total of only 19 times.\nClosing out the top ten:\n7. Fran Walsh, wife of “Sir” Peter Jackson, 18 mentions\n8. Sheila Nevins, 17 mentions\nT9. Francis Ford Coppola & Barrie Osborne, 16 mentions each\nT10. Martin Scorsese & Saul Zaentz, 15 mentions each\nWhile Scorsese has been mentioned 15 times, the legendary director did not secure his first Oscar until 2007, for the 2006 film The Departed.\nVocativ also compiled an honorable mentions list, which includes those in the “10-Timers Club,” featuring individuals who have been thanked at least 10 times, but have yet to crack the top ten.\nThose names include:\nJeffrey Katzenberg (12), John Lasseter (11), Bob Fosse (11) Ridley Scott (11), Bob Zemeckis (10), Robert Redford (10), Tim Burton (10) and George Clooney (10).\nThe 87th annual Academy Awards will air this Sunday on ABC at 7:00 Eastern time.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/02/20/who-gets-thanked-the-most-at-the-oscars-it-isnt-god/"}
