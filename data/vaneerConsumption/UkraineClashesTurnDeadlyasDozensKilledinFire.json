Several people were reported killed, but the toll rose sharply after a trade union building was set ablaze.\nWith flames roaring out of the doors and windows, occupants perched on ledges waiting for help.\nThe flare-up came as Ukraine troops were attempting to drive pro-Russian separatists out of Slovyansk, one of several cities across the east occupied by protesters opposing the new Kiev government.\nLike Slovyansk and the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea, Odessa has a significant number of Russian speakers and played a prominent role in Russian history.\nAll of those regions formed the power base for former President Viktor Yanukovych, whose ouster led to the formation of the current administration in Kiev.\nVideo footage of the clashes showed riot police attempting to control the crowds, some of whom had masks, shields and clubs similar to those seen in the violent Kiev protests that led to the fall of Yanukovych in February.\n\"The violence and mayhem that led to so many senseless deaths and injuries is unacceptable,\" said Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department.\nWithout mentioning Russia by name, Harf said violence and \"efforts to destabilize the country must end.\"\nâ€” Tracy Connor, Alexander Smith and Albina Kovalyova","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/ukraine-clashes-turn-deadly-dozens-killed-fire-n95916"}
