Chávez endowed the National Armed Forces with excellent electronic warfare units,” he continued. “Where are those units that we do not use to hack those DolarToday pages today? We cannot wait until they knock us down.”\nCarreño made the comments following a report from the Associated Press that President Donald Trump pressed his aides on whether to invade Venezuela and topple the Maduro regime to help end the country’s humanitarian crisis and promote regional security.\nThe idea was allegedly met with strong opposition by Trump’s then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster as well as outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who both said it would undermine U.S relationships in the region.\nLast month, Colombia’s President-elect Ivan Duque met with Republican Senator Marco Rubio, seen as one of the architects of the Trump administration’s approach to Cuba and Venezuela, to discuss the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.\nMe reuní con el presidente electo de #Colombia @IvanDuque para hablar sobre nuestras relaciones bilaterales y esfuerzos regionales para ayudar al pueblo venezolano a poner fin a su crisis y restaurar su democracia.
