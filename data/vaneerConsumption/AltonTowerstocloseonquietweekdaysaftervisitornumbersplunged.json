Dancer Vicky Balch, 20, (right) was forced to have her right leg amputated below the knee. Her friend Daniel Thorpe (left) was also injured\nThis graphic shows how the rollercoaster crash unfolded, demonstrating how the carriage carrying 16 passengers smashed into an empty 'test' carriage when a safety mechanism was manually overridden\nAn Alton Towers spokesman said: 'The park will be closed on a small number of days when guest visitation has historically been very low, which is mid-week during our quieter periods.\n'This action will also allow us to focus our efforts on those days when we know we will be busy.'\nHowever, the resort's annual jobs drive, which launched this month, will see the recruitment of more than 1,200 temporary staff.\nPaul Williams, Staffordshire University's head of business, said the decision to close on quieter days would be part of the park's business plan following last year's crash.\nHe said: 'Although Alton Towers continues to be one of Staffordshire's tourism success stories, it has been widely reported that 2015 was a particularly challenging year for the company and they are rightly looking to implement a comprehensive recovery plan in advance of the new season.\nWhen MailOnline visited the park in July, many of the rides - including the Oblivion - were relatively quiet\nThe usually popular Congo River Rapids water ride was so empty just after midday on July 31 that staff were forced to send around two carts in a row without any visitors\n'However, while the decision to not open the theme park on \"quiet days\" during the off-peak season is a key change, it is not uncommon in other service organisations.\n'I understand that this is a Merlin Group strategic decision rather than being unique to Alton Towers, with a number of its other theme parks and attractions also set to remain closed on days where demand from visitors is relatively lower.\n'This seems to make good business, operations and resort management sense.\n'I have no doubt that this year will see people returning to the resort and that the publicity will shift to focus on how Alton Towers is once again delivering a magical experience.'\nThe season will launch on Saturday, March 19.\nNew attractions will include a rollercoaster restaurant, which will see food do a loop-the-loop before being delivered to a table.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3394072/Alton-Towers-close-completely-quiet-weekdays-visitor-numbers-plunged-following-horrific-Smiler-crash.html"}
