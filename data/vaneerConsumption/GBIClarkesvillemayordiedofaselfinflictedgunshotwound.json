Greene, 53, was taken to Habersham Medical Center, then flown to Atlanta Medical Center, where he died.\nGBI spokesman Scott Dutton previously said local authorities asked his agency to investigate the shooting. That investigation is ongoing, Miles said Thursday.\nGreene, a Habersham County physician, was first elected to the Clarkesville City Council in 1999 after serving four years on the city’s planning and zoning commission.\nA graduate of the University of Georgia and the Medical College of Georgia, Greene had been mayor since 2005. He and his wife have four children, according to the city.\nJerry Wise, chief operating officer of Habersham Medical Center, issued the following statement on the hospital’s Facebook page Monday:\n“The Habersham Medical Center family is filled with unimaginable grief and sadness upon learning of the passing of Dr. Terry Greene. Our hearts go out to his family, office staff, patients and countless others who admired and appreciated his medical expertise and leadership. Dr. Greene served for 23 years on the HMC Medical Staff, including serving as Chief of Staff from 2012 to 2014. His passing is a huge loss to our medical family, and we join the entire Habersham County community in mourning.”","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/gbi-clarkesville-mayor-died-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound/nthSbiBhe05Tv5Bqc6S2qI/"}
