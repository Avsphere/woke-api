Everything we had to eat was very good and I especially enjoyed the homemade vegetable pickles that came with our meat and cheese plate. Will they share the recipe? — Lola Craig, Atlanta\nChef Daniel Porubiansky is always generous with his recipes. This is the recipe for the sweet pickles served on the restaurant’s charcuterie platters. You’ll notice there’s no salt. The vegetables being pickled are always seasonal with the exception of red onions and okra which Century House Tavern diners love and expect to have available year round. In the summer, Porubiansky will pickle cherry tomatoes. In cooler months, it will be beets. Some of the prettiest pickles are the red, yellow and orange baby carrots available in spring and fall.\nOne note is that the restaurant does vary the vinegar a bit. For example, when pickling red onions, they like using red wine vinegar. So feel free to match the vinegar profile with the vegetables you’re pickling. And if you’re pickling okra, add about 1/3 cup of salt to the brine when heating it.\nCentury House Tavern, 125 E.
