If that happens the belts can detach.\nThe company says it knows of one minor injury caused by the problem.\nThe trouble was discovered in September when an owner reported that the front passenger belt in a 2013 Sonata came loose in a collision.\nOwners will be notified starting April 7. Dealers will inspect the seat belt anchor system and repair it if needed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319876/Hyundai-recalls-978-000-cars-seat-belts-come-loose.html"}
