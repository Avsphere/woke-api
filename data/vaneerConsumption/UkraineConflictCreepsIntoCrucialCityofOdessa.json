The city is home to key railroad and highway junctions, and is considered a major industrial, cultural, scientific, and resort center.\nOdessa was the Soviet Union's leading Black Sea port and it remains a vital link, shipping grain, sugar, machinery, coal, petroleum products, cement, metals, and timber. In 2008, the Port of Odessa handled over 34.5 million tons of cargo, according to World Port Source. Meanwhile, some 150,000 tourists visit the city every year.\n“Odessa is so important because it in fact is in the southwestern part of Ukraine, and it was a place that was perceived as being more stable than east Ukraine because it has a smaller percentage of ethnic Russians,” said William Pomeranz, Deputy Director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.\nHe noted that it’s still unclear how much of the insurgency is being directly influenced by Moscow, but any unrest in other parts of Ukraine now “makes it more difficult for the current provisional government (in Kiev) to maintain a united front and try to isolate the areas of uprising in the eastern part of Ukraine.”\nAnd if Ukraine’s central government loses both Crimea and Odessa, it would essentially become a landlocked nation.\n“Ukraine without any seaports obviously is a much weaker country,” Pomeranz said.\n“Odessa is crucial to Ukraine’s economy, that is the most important thing to understand,” said Anton Fedyashin, Executive Director of the Initiative for Russian Culture at American University. “A lot of Ukraine’s trade with the rest of the world goes through Odessa.”\nAnd there’s additional worry that instability in Odessa could spread to the “Transnistria” region, an ethnically diverse strip of land between Ukraine and Moldova.\n“We've worried about Russian designs on Transnistria from the start, so the expansion of violence also threatens to spill beyond Ukraine,” said Goldgeier.\nOdessa was ripe for being dragged into the same strife facing the eastern part of Ukraine because it has such a diverse population.\n“Ukraine is in grave danger of collapsing as a country.\"\n“And it has been historically a very big city with a huge Russian population, Jewish and Ukrainian, so it’s always been a really sort of remarkable mixing bowl,” said Fedyashin.\nThe primary language spoken in Odessa is in fact Russian, and in 2010 most of the people in that region, as well as the eastern sections, voted for former president Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russia figure who was ousted in February.\nSo, Fedyashin noted, ending the strife in the country at large is not as easy as telling the Russians to go home.\n“To marginalize and alienate the Russians and believe that this will solve Ukraine’s problems is absolutely crazy,” he said. “The Russians and the Europeans are going to have to work together.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/ukraine-conflict-creeps-crucial-city-odessa-n97391"}
