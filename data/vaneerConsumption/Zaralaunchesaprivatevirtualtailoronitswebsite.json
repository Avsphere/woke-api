It appears that nothing within the section costs more than £40.\nA message tells shoppers 'Size M was bought and not returned for size by 80 per cent of shoppers with your approximate height, weight and fit preference' *(as an example)\nThe Spanish brand, part of the Inditex group, now has more than 2,000 branches all over the world.\nIt is quick to pick up on catwalk trends and famously ships new products into its stores twice a week.\nIt has enjoyed something of a popularity boom in recent years, with many of its catwalk-inspired products taking on a cult status.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4447660/Zara-launches-virtual-tailoring-service-website.html"}
