I couldn't believe it when I saw the likeness. Same amount of stubble! Same hair style! Same glasses! They are, as far as we know, unrelated!'\nMetro.co.uk report that a woman in the audience accidentally went up to Kobi and, mistaking him for comedian Rob, complimented him on his comedy show.\nSpeaking to the website, Rob said: ‘She was complimenting him on my material. When I saw him I was like damn! This is crazy. We look so similar.’\n'I would have chased him down the street if he had left without one!,' said Rob, pictured, who added his twin stranger on Facebook and hopes to see him again at each other's comedy gigs\nTo make matters even more eerie, Kobi, who has just relocated from Israel, is also a comedian and is prepping for his first English-language gig.\nAs well as having a good catch up, the pair also ensured they got a selfie. ‘I would have chased him down the street if he had left without one!,' said Rob, who added his twin stranger on Facebook and hopes to see him again at each other's comedy gigs.\nThe duo are by no means the first doppelgangers who have gone viral.\nNiamh Geaney, 26, from Ireland, spearheaded the Twin Strangers concept and met her first lookalike, Karen Branigan, and staged a photoshoot that went viral.\nShe then discovered Luisa Guizzardi in Italy and then more recently she amazingly found Irene Adams, who also hails from Ireland. So are these women - who look eerily similar - at all related?\nNiamh decided to find out by taking a DNA test with her most recent doppelgänger, Irene, to find out.\nNiamh Geaney, 26, right, who launched a project with her friends called Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, recently found her third doppelgänger, Irene Adams, left, also 26. The duo decided to take a DNA test to determine whether they really were at all related\nNeil Douglas, right, was shocked to discover his identical twin, Robert Stirling, from London, on a flight from Stansted to Shannon Airport, County Clare, in October last year\nA few weeks ago Niamh and her latest doppelganger Irene took swabs of their saliva and sent them off to a lab to be tested.\nThey tested the DNA to discover whether Niamh and Irene are sisters, half-sisters and - most interestingly - whether they are related up to 20,000 years ago.\nThe first test looked at whether they are sisters, with a probability of 0.0006 per cent and odds of 150,000/1.\nThe next test assessed whether they are half-sisters, with a probability is 1.1 per cent and odds of 93/1.\nThe final test - a lineage test - assessed whether they are related anywhere up to 20,000 years ago - with results showing they are not related at all.\nExplaining the results, Niamh said: 'The results are reported as “statistical likelihood” or chances/odds.\n'So while they can’t say 100 per cent (you never can with DNA on account of the randomness of nature), the statistical likelihood is calculated based on the genetic markers that you share (Niamh and Irene, or Niamh and any other member of the population, we will all share some markers because they’re present in all members of the population).'\nSpeaking about meeting Niamh, Irene, 26, said: 'I was out shopping and a girl from school who I hadn't talked to in years was telling me about this \"Doppelganger girl\" all over YouTube that was my twin. I hadn't heard about the project so I went home and ­out of curiosity ­looked it up.\n'I then received a Facebook friend request from Niamh and a funny message about how she thought we looked alike. I was intrigued so decided to meet up with her.'\nNiamh decided to find out by taking a DNA test with her most recent doppelgänger, Irene, to find out if they share both parents, one parent or are related through their ancestors 20,000 years back\nNiamh, right, has discovered yet another lookalike in the form of Irene Adams, also 26, who lives in her home country of Ireland\nNiamh, 26, left, found her first doppelgänger through social media after setting herself the challenge of finding her 'twin stranger'. She then found the second one in the form of Luisa Guizzardi, right, who lives in Genoa, Italy\nNiamh, left, with her first 'twin stranger' Karen Branigan (right). The pair were photographed together and the shoot went viral with people shocked at how similar the unrelated duo look\nNiamh said meeting her doppelgängers is becoming quite a thrill.\nDescribing how she felt before her meeting with Irene, she said: 'You never lose that excitement mixed with nerves before coming face­-to-­face with your lookalike, it's just as nerve-­racking as the first time! All these questions run through your mind: 'Will she look like me?', 'Will she think I look like her?', 'What is she like?', 'Is she nice?'.\n'Then­ on meeting her ­you feel amazement, wonder and awe take over, along with an overwhelming desire to ask her a million and one questions (to see if she's like you in other ways!).'\nIn June, Niamh had journeyed to Genoa, Italy, to meet her second lookalike Luisa Guizzardi, who is around the same age and contacted her via her website, twinstrangers.com.\n'I had this crazy idea to fly and meet her,' explains Niamh, who also met Luisa's friends and family and filmed the encounter in a video.\nOn meeting Niamh, even Luisa's mother said she struggled to tell the difference.\n'From a distance, I thought you were Luisa,' she said before wiping away tears.\n'Not only do we look the same, but we have the same soul,' said Luisa, who works in a hotel. 'Like soulmates.'\nNiamh added: 'I really do think I have another friend for life and god help me if I find my seven because they're never going to get rid of me.'\nThe resemblance between Niamh and Luisa isn't quite as uncanny as that between her and her first doppelganger, Karen Branigan, right, who she found in April\nNow Niamh is helping others meet their lookalikes with her project, set up with her friends Harry and Terence, by adding photos to their website. Facial recognition is then used to try and find a match.\n'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' she said. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'\nThe project had originally been a Facebook page but is now a website in its own right to respond to the worldwide demand.\nNiamh said: 'Our Facebook page (which now has over 360,000 followers) simply couldn't cope with the demand, so we decided to set up the site so that people could search for and connect with their own lookalikes from all over the world.\n'We now have over three quarters of a million users ​on the site and Twin Strangers are connecting through it every day. It's been an amazing journey so far and we don't really know where it's going to end!'\nLikewise, Neil Douglas was shocked to discover his identical twin, Robert Stirling, from London, on a flight from Stansted to Shannon Airport, County Clare, in October last year.\nInstead of asking the stranger to move the 32-year-old wedding photographer, from Glasgow, took a selfie and shared the image on Twitter.\nThe pair, who were even wearing similar black tops, later realised they were booked into the same Irish hotel and enjoyed a pint together in a nearby pub.\nSpeaking to MailOnline, Mr Douglas said: 'I asked him to move and when the guy looked up, I thought: \"Holy s***, he looks like me.\n'We had a big laugh about it – everyone had a laugh. We took a selfie and that was it.\n'I later checked into my hotel in Galway to find my doppelganger checking into the same hotel ahead of me. Total weirdness.'\nMr Stirling, a 35-year-old civil servant from Redbridge, added: 'I had actually swapped my seat on the plane so that a couple could sit together.\n'Neil suddenly appeared next to me and all my mates started shouting, saying that we had to take a picture.\n'We chatted on the flight for just over an hour, he was a very nice guy.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3422562/American-man-meets-doppelganger-stand-gig-London-complete-stranger-comedian.html"}
