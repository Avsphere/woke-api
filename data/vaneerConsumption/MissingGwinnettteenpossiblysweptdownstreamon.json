He was last seen around Thursday.\nFriends of the missing teen told police that McGhee and three others decided to cross the Yellow River that day. Three of them made it over to the other bank. However, the friends said McGhee didn’t.\nGwinnett Police spokeswoman Cpl. Michele Pihera said that authorities were not notified about the disappearance until late Friday night or early Saturday morning.\n“We have officers searching the Yellow River on foot,” Pihera said in an email. “Our helicopter was assisting with the search, too.”\nPolice also requested assistance from a cadaver search dog, which is standard protocol, Pihera said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cops-missing-gwinnett-teen-possibly-swept-downstream-yellow-river/pnU8p5QUzEhgwbL7MyTT3L/"}
