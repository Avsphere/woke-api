'Executive order does not strip any monument of a designation. The executive order does not loosen any environmental or conservation regulation on any land or marine areas.'\nZinke also tried to assuage environmentalists' fears by saying things like 'I'm a Teddy Roosevelt guy' and 'no one loves our public lands more than I.'\nNATIONAL MONUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW Grand Staircase-Escalante, Utah Grand Canyon-Parashant, Arizona Giant Sequoia, California Hanford Reach, Washington Canyons of the Ancients, Colorado Ironwood Forest, Arizona Vermilion Cliffs, Arizona Carrizo Plain, California Papahanaumokuakea Marine, Hawaii\nSonoran Desert, Arizona Upper Missouri River Breaks, Montana World War II Valor in the Pacific, California, Hawaii, Alaska Marianas Trench, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam Pacific Remote Islands, Pacific Ocean Rose Atoll, American Samoa Rio Grande del Norte, New Mexico Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, New Mexico Basin and Range, Nevada Berryessa Snow Mountain, California Mojave Trails, California Sand to Snow, California Northeast Canyons & Seamounts, Massachusetts Gold Butte, Nevada Bears Ears, Utah\n'You can love them as much, but you can't love them more than I do and that's one of the reasons why I love my job,' Zinke said.\nBut he noted that the Antiquities Act even said that the monument should be the 'smallest area compatible' with what the government was trying to preserve, noting that the recent trend has been for monuments to be larger and larger.\nAs a White House fact sheet put it, 'the average size of monuments has exploded in recent decades.'\nZinke also pointed out that before lands were designated as national monuments, they were still public lands, and thus could serve more purposes, including farming, ranching, timber harvest, mining, oil and gas exploration, fishing and motorized sports.\n'I am opposed to transfer or sale of public lands,' he stated, though added, 'We can do a lot better as a government managing our land and to a degree we have drifted too far away from multiple use to single use.'\nBeing a 'national monument' was the single use Zinke was referring to.\n'The administration, as ya'll know, has heard from members of Congress and states, and in some cases the designation of the monument has resulted in loss of jobs, reduced wages and reduced public access,' Zinke also argued.\nThe monument considered to be most at risk was one Obama designated in 2016, Bears Ears national monument in Utah, which includes 1.35 million acres and many sacred Native American sites.\nDespite years of communication between the administration, elected officials and local stakeholders, including a coalition of 30 Native American tribes, some Utah politicians are still grumbling about it.\n'I think the concern I have and the president has is when you designate a monument, the local community that's affected should have a voice. And he said that in the campaign,' Zinke said of President Trump.\n'This executive order does not predispose any action other than have the secretary that he chose, me, review them,' Zinke continued.\n'And I'm going to review them in a transparent matter, I'm going to make sure we have a voice,' the Interior secretary said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4445476/Now-Trump-takes-aim-national-monuments.html"}
