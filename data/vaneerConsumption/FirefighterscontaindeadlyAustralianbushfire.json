Another two people perished in neighbouring South Australia state in the same month.\nDFES commissioner Wayne Gregson warned on Sunday that the worst of the bushfire season was yet to come.\n\"There is still another 10 or more weeks to go in what is predicted to be a difficult bushfire season,\" he said.\nAustralia's worst firestorm in recent years devastated parts of the southern state of Victoria in 2009, destroying thousands of homes and killing 173 people.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393323/Firefighters-contain-deadly-Australian-bushfire.html"}
