The whole day is going to stay like this, which is fair, but they are expecting some horrible winds later in the week and then it gets really difficult.'\nLarrazabal won on the 'Desert Swing' in Abu Dhabi two years ago and claimed his fourth European Tour title in the BMW International Open last June, but suffered a back injury during The Open which kept him out for several weeks.\n'Last year I was playing very good in the middle of the season and had a big injury at the Open Championship,' Larrazabal said. 'After that it was very difficult to keep the rhythm and come back.'\nLawrie's first win in Qatar came in 1999, the same year as his Open triumph at Carnoustie, with the second in 2012 helping him secure a Ryder Cup return at Medinah after an absence of 13 years.\n'I'm very happy,' the 47-year-old said. 'It was obviously quite tough this afternoon, the wind was blowing. I got off to a terrible start and three-putted the first from sort of about 15 feet. Been out here a long time, so you put these things behind you pretty quickly.'\nOliver Wilson of England plays out of the desert on the par four 5th hole during the first round\nAsked about his reputation as a good player in bad weather, Lawrie added: 'I'm happy knocking it down. I'm happy hitting five-iron 160 yards into kind of a strong breeze.\n'I've always been able to do it, stick the ball a bit further back in the stance and take a bit of speed off it. It's not rocket science, so I kind of quite enjoy doing that.'\nGarcia carded four birdies in six holes from the seventh but bogeyed the 13th, three-putted the 17th and lipped out for birdie on the last.\n'I feel like I should have done better,' the world No 12 said. 'Obviously it's my first round of the year, but I felt like I probably turned a 68 or 67 into a 70.\n'It's unfortunate, but with the high winds that we have on the forecast, obviously the greens are a little bit slower to make sure the ball doesn't move, and these greens are a little bit grainy already.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-3420612/Louis-Oosthuizen-Pablo-Larrazabal-set-pace-Qatar-Masters-Paul-Lawrie-lurks-close-behind.html"}
