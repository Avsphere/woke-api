The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nRALEIGH, N.C. -- The Democratic congressional primary race between former \"American Idol\" runner-up Clay Aiken and textile entrepreneur Keith Crisco remained very close and without a clear winner early Wednesday.\nAiken and Crisco each had about 40 percent of the vote, trailed by licensed family counselor Toni Morris of Fayetteville in Tuesday's primary race in the 2nd Congressional District.\nAiken's first political campaign drew an unusual amount of celebrity buzz thanks to his singing career and a second-place finish on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" Crisco spent four years as the state's top business recruiter under former Democratic Gov. Beverly Perdue.\nThe primary winner will challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Renee Ellmers in November. Ellmers, first elected in the 2010 tea party wave, handily defeated her challenger in the heavily Republican district.\nAiken has said reporters are the only people asking whether being a gay man could impede his campaign to represent such a conservative district. Both he and Crisco touted themselves as centrists.\n\"We need to stay out of people's bedrooms,\" Bob Finch, a 57-year-old Democrat from Lee County, said Tuesday.\n- The Associated Press","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/american-idol-star-clay-aikens-primary-too-close-call-n98981"}
