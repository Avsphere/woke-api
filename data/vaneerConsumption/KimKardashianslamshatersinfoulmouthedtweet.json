The reality star posted the thinly veiled tweet at 11.22pm PST, and deleted it a minute later after some playful banter with her friend Sarah Howard on the social media site\nWhat are they like? The thread started when Kim posted a video of Sarah twerking and playfully took the mickey out of her on the social media site\nAs for me? On Tuesday, Kim claimed to be acting as good as gold, even cheekily referencing the hysteria over her unairbrushed photos by saying she looked 'flawless'\nThe reality star and influencer stunned the world with the candid images of her boobs and butt in a vintage Christian Dior two-piece.\nThen, after complaining that her friends were 'fat-shaming' her over unairbrushed pictures of her hourglass figure, Kanye West's wife Kim did what any body-confident beach babe would do and slipped on a thong, sticking a metaphorical middle figure up to the haters.\nHer friends have even been helping her to stave off the weight during the wild weekend, with Kim complaining that her milkshake was 'spiked' by her hair stylist Jen Atkin to stop her from consuming the calories.\nOuch: On Monday night, the 36-year-old star took to Twitter to post about gal pal Jen Atkin 'fat shaming' her, as she gave a play-by-play of the events of their girls' weekend\nShe wrote: '@Jenatkinhair spiked my Oreo shake to try to get me to not eat it because she's fat shaming me,' Kim wrote, joking with her long-term friend in view of her 51.2M followers.\nHer recent weight loss - for which she controversially thanked a sickly 'flu' bug - struck a stark contrast between her toned middle and her shapely hips and bottom.\nKim is mother to North, three, and one-year-old Saint West by husband Kanye, while Kourtney has Mason, seven, Penelope, four, and two-year-old Reign with estranged partner Scott Disick.\nCheeky: Kim recently monetised her distinctive behind, by making a pool float out of her hilarious bum Kimoji\nBody-conscious Kim recently celebrated escalating her post-baby weight loss when she contracted the flu, tweeting about the weight loss in an arguably 'irresponsible' fashion, after making a full recovery.\nShe said: 'The flu can be an amazing diet. So happy it came in time for the Met [Gala] lol #6lbsdown,' she wrote, praising her preparation for the Costume Institute Gala, due to be held this May in New York City.\nOn Tuesday, feeling slightly more positive, Kim poked fun at the interest pictures of her in various pieces of swimwear on Twitter.\nKim, whose ample bottom has its own emoji and caused a sensation on the front cover of Paper magazine in 2014 slyly tweeted: 'Oh and as for me you ask? ...I'm just sitting here on the beach with my flawless body.'\nBreak the internet: Kim's perfect bum almost broke the internet in 2014, with her bare bottom gracing Paper magazine's cover\nWhile Kim's latest snaps have caused some to criticise her appearance, a source told Radar that she has been hurt by what she has read about herself.\nThey claim: 'Kim is really upset about what people are saying\n'This was a huge eye opener for her, she sees that SO many people are so vicious and it has really hurt her feelings.\n'Kim is crushed that people are being so mean to her about the cellulite on her butt.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4447964/Defiant-Kim-Kardashian-slams-haters-foul-mouthed-tweet.html"}
