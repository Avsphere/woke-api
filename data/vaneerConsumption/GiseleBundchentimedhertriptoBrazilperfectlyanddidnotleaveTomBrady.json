On Wednesday she also posted a picture of a Buddha, perhaps reflecting her chilled mood\nIt read: 'I am not what you think I am. You are what you think I am', which she had also translated into Portuguese.\nThe beauty was seen landing at the Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Tuesday, after flying straight in and not wasting any time to console a visibly disappointed Brady.\nOn Monday she had taken to Instagram to post a gorgeous picture of her husband Tom seeking solace in the arms of his children after his team the New England Patriots had struck out of the AFC Championship.\nConsolation prize: Gisele shared this image of the sportsman cuddling their children on Monday after his crushing AFC Championship Game loss\nThe professional clotheshorse shared the image of her man with six-year-old Benjamin and three-year-old daughter Vivian with her 7.6million followers on Instagram.\nThe emotional 35-year-old Brazilian beauty said: 'I can't handle it, so much love! #family #love #grateful.'\nGisele also sent out a tweet to fans where she paid tribute for their support.\nShe couldn't bare to watch: Gisele shared an image of their daughter holding some pre-game words of encouragement\nThe Brady crunch: Tom being sacked by Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib during Sunday's game\nFeeling deflated: Tom looked sad as he trudged off the field following their loss\nShe said: 'Thank you all for the messages supporting Tom. We're so proud of him. #gratitude.'\nNo doubt the words of support from her followers were just the tonic after his New England Patriots were destroyed by the Denver Broncos, who are led by his old rival Payton Manning.\nDespite the fact he was leading the reigning Super Bowl champions against a team whose biggest star is now nearly 40-years-old coming off an injury-plagued season, they were unable to vanquish their foes.\nThey even missed out on a last minute opportunity to take the game into overtime after failing to secure a two-point conversion.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3423418/Gisele-Bundchen-timed-trip-Brazil-perfectly-did-not-leave-Tom-Brady-dust-Super-Bowl-disappointment.html"}
