In 2000, I got paid maybe $10 an hour.\n'Inflation has definitely risen, but cooks’ wages haven’t. That’s one of our biggest issues.\n'We want to be able to grow as a company so we can provide for more people. This is a way we might be able to do that. And if it doesn’t work, we can always go back to the old way.'\nThe menu for the restaurant has yet to go public, but it is expected prices will be on par with his Second Avenue eatery Ssäm Bar.\nThe restaurant's official Instagram page tweeted a picture from the inside of the eatery. The menu for the restaurant has yet to go public, but it is expected prices will be on par with his Second Avenue eatery Ssäm Bar\nHowever, Mr Chang is not the first celebrtity chef in New York to ban tipping in his restaurants.\nIn October, famed restaurateur Danny Meyer said he will eliminate tipping at his 13 full-service eateries over the next year starting with Modern, inside the Museum of Modern Art.\nInstead of leaving cash at the end of the meal, diners can expect to pay up to 25 per cent more for each dish, with no option to withhold their generosity if the experience is not up to scratch.\nThe change will affect all of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group eateries, including New York staples such as Blue Smoke, Marta and Gramercy Tavern, though not the Shake Shack spinoff.\nRestaurateur Danny Meyer has announced that tipping will be banned from all 13 of his New York eateries while prices will jump up to 25 per cent, with no option to withhold the cash if the experience falls short\nThe increase will likely mean dishes such as Maialino’s famed devil’s chicken jumping in price from $29 to $39.10, while the tasting menu at Modern could shoot up from the current $138 to $172.50.\nMeyer says the extra money will then be funneled into raising basic salaries for all his workers, from pot boys all the way up to chefs, and placed into a revenue share program, allowing employees to profit from the restaurant group's success.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393645/Top-chef-bans-tipping-new-Manhattan-restaurant-saying-prices-reflect-real-work-gone-making-dishes.html"}
