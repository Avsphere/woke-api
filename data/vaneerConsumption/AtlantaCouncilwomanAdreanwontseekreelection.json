I have found service to my district and all city residents to be the most satisfying and richest experience of my life and will always be appreciative of my constituents and the city of Atlanta for the opportunity to serve.”\nAdrean chaired the council’s finance executive committee and played a central role in Atlanta’s pension reform efforts. She also worked with the Atlanta Police Foundation and the city’s police department to add cameras around the city, she said.\nAdrean is the latest councilmember to give up her seat, setting the stage for what will be a largely new City Council in November.\nCouncilmembers Ceasar Mitchell, Mary Norwood, Keisha Lance Bottoms and Kwanza Hall have given up their seats to run for mayor. City Councilmembers Felicia Moore, C.T. Martin and Alex Wan are giving up their seats to run for City Council President.\nAdrean said stepping down will allow her more time to spend with her family.\n“As an active and engaged citizen, I will remain committed to issues that affect quality of life in our communities,” she said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/atlanta-councilwoman-adrean-won-seek-election/MwjMOl5AKx0PQ6VSXbVR8H/"}
