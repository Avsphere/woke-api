Davina's racy display comes after she was subjected to harsher critiques of being 'wooden' as she helmed the American-style talk show on Tuesday\nThe issue seemed mostly to revolve around her auto-cue reading ability.\n'Rubbish presenting by Davina McCall tonight... clearly reading off the auto-cue,' someone posted to Twitter, getting the ball rolling on the nightly viewer tirade.\n'Davina McCall reading the auto-queue like a 6 year old read Biff, Chip & Kipper!' came a second moaning tweeter.\n'Fair enough reading off an auto-cue but be a little more subtle Davina McCall,' another posted.\nAnother disgruntled (and sexist) commentator wrote: 'Jesus Christ Davina McCall is dreadful at presenting #TheNightlyShow - It needs a funny guy to present it. And not John Bishop.'\nHere we go again: Davina McCall started to face the same backlash her predecessor presenters John Bishop and David Walliams had faced over the previous fortnight, as she hosted The Nightly Show for a second night\nA pleasant surprise: Davina quit Twitter for a week while she hosted ITV's Nightly Show fearing a deluge of mean tweets only for viewers to flood her Twitter feed with praise\n'Oh my god just bring back the News At Ten!' came another tweet, followed by: 'I just can't abide by the cringe of Davina this week!'\nAnother said the 49-year-old TV pro 'was looking lost'.\nThere was still a smattering of positive feedback, with one person writing 'I actually really like The Nightly Show with Davina' and another typing: '@ThisisDavina has really turned the #TheNightlyShow arround. Until this week it's been dire but Davina is amazing.'\nHarsh: 'Fair enough reading off an auto-cue but be a little more subtle Davina McCall,' someone posted\nDavina therefore decided to quit Twitter for a week when she hosted the show, expecting a deluge of mean-spirited tweets.\nAnd although this seems to now have happened, her debut on Monday was mostly declared a success.\nHaving previously informed her Twitter followers that she would be off the site until Saturday because of her hosting gig - and told the haters to 'fill yer boots' - the reaction was quite the opposite with viewers flooding her Twitter feed with praise for her comedic presenting skills.\nTaking precautions: Davina informed her followers that she was leaving Twitter so they could 'fill yer boots' and criticise her on the social media site only for the opposite to happen\nFans: Tweets came flooding in to declare her hosting gig a great success\n'Best show yet': The Twitter users declared that Davina was a better host than David Walliams and John Bishop\nFalling flat: After high praise from fans the night before, Davina was subject to harsher critique as she helmed the American-style talk show on Tuesday\nAuto-boo! The issue seemed mostly to revolve around her auto-cue reading ability\nOne wrote: 'Not watched a single episode of this new ITV Nightly Show, until now - get Davina on it every night and I'm sold!'\nThe veteran presenter displayed her skills on her first episode which saw her interviewing Boy George and The Replacement actress Vicky McClure.\nDavina filled the show with references to her wild youth spent falling in and out of night clubs and added in jokes about vibrators and her married sex life, or lack thereof.\nShe made it clear from the beginning that the show would be a sweary one.\n'It's 10pm,' the fitness fan announced, 'so I'm going to say f*** and b*****ks as much as I like.'\nOn the sofa: The second of Davina's The Nightly Show episodes featured guests David Baddiel and Sara Cox\nStill got the moves: Viewers were delighted by Davina's foul-mouthed appearance and jokes about her married sex life, or lack thereof, the night before\nHer success came just days after former GBBO presenters Mel and Sue got 'cold feet' about hosting the beleaguered show.\nAn ITV insider told The Sun: 'It looked as though it was all but finalised, but they never quite signed on the dotted line.\n'Unfortunately the talks collapsed when they decided they couldnâ€™t possibly make their diaries fit with ITV and have had to turn down the offer.'\nThe positive reaction must be all the sweeter for Davina after her own BBC chat show, called Davina, was axed after just eight episodes a decade ago.\nA long wait: The initial positive reaction must have been all the sweeter for Davina after her own chat show, Davina, was axed by the BBC after just eight episodes a decade ago","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4318424/Davina-McCall-fakes-cringe-worthy-ORGASM-live-air.html"}
