And Hillary Clinton made a credible case on that. But they want somebody whose a truth teller in she’s get some distance to cover a on that.”\nHe added, “I did books that involved her. One of her political mottos, personal mottos, was ‘fake it until you make it,’ and that’s clever and that means ‘I’m going to tough it out.’ but you can’t fake your way into the presidency. So shes got to convince people, I’m really going to tell you the truth.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/06/14/woodward-hillary-cant-fake-her-way-into-the-presidency/"}
