He is married to a Russian woman who is struggling to immigrate to the U.S., and so he currently lives in Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city, on the Siberian side of the Ural Mountains — about as far as you can get from L.A.\nHe is hard at work preparing for a “California Embassy” in Moscow, Bloomberg reports, “with the help of a vehemently anti-American group supported by the Kremlin” called the Anti-Globalist Movement of Russia.\nAfter Hillary Clinton’s repeated attempts to link rival Donald Trump to Putin and Russia (despite her own pro-Russia policy as Secretary of State), it may shock many of the leftist supporters of California’s secession to learn about their foreign patron.\nRussia had a small colonial presence in California in the early 19th century — a fact that led Russian officials to joke about invading California during the international crisis over the Crimea in 2014.\nMarinelli says his motivations are not advancing Russia’s interests, but those of left-wing Americans.\n“California is a much more open, tolerant society, inclusive of immigrants or people of different sexual orientation,” Marinelli told Bloomberg.\nSo how did he get mixed up with the Anti-Globalist Movement of Russia?\nNot surprisingly, with the diverse array of issues driving California’s growing secessionist movement, immigration played a key role for Marinelli.\nThe visa issues his wife faced, caused by a slow-moving bureaucracy that he calls a “quagmire,” finally turned him against America, he told Bloomberg.\nHe was so offended by the “anti-immigrant rhetoric” in America that he came to adopt the views of his adopted home state of California. That was before he moved to Russia.\nRussia is well known for courting far-right, anti-establishment parties in Europe. However, Bloomberg notes, it also supports far-left movements in a variety of countries.\nThat now appears true of #CalExit as well — a movement that has become important enough for the President Pro Tem of the California State Senate, Kevin de Léon (D-Los Angeles), to acknowledge in his opening speech earlier this week.\n“Many Californians – some tongue-in-cheek, some hand-to-heart – have advocated withdrawal. But, in America, no state ever succeeds by seceding,” he said.\nThe left, and Russia, have a different view.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2016/12/08/secession-calexit-putin-russia-california-secede/"}
