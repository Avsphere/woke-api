Everything about me, the word \"chubby\", I think, describes everything in a way,' she added.\nShe was chosen for the task after revealing that her relationship with her weight was holding her back from getting married.\n'The way that I look is definitely stopping me from wanting to get married,' said Steph, who is engaged to her partner.\nNegative body image: Steph used a lot of negative words to describe herself for the artist, variously calling herself 'a brick', 'very large' and even comparing her figure to 'a bowling ball'\nWedding woes! She was chosen for the task after revealing that her relationship with her weight was holding her back from getting married\nThe other contestants were then asked to describe Steph's features to the artist, which were far more positive than her own assessment.\nWhen Steph saw the two drawings, she said the one based on her description was accurate and said the others had been 'much kinder' in their descriptions.\n'She's so hard on herself,' Nikki later said to the camera.\n'You don't know how much all that means,' Steph said tearfully after the contestants claimed she was in fact a 'beautiful woman.'\nThe psychologist explained: 'You're gonna be transforming your mindset so you can get the most sustainable improvements in your overall well-being.'\n'You guys were much kinder': The other contestants were then asked to describe Steph's features to the sketch artist, which were far more positive than her own assessment\nMaking progress: 'You're going to be transforming your mindset so you can get the most sustainable improvements in your overall well-being', said the psychologist\nLater, the elimination challenge was announced as an endurance weight challenge, where the teams would need to hold barbells for 30 minutes, with the team holding the most at the end winning.\nGiven 200kg in weights, they were forced to decide how much each individual contestant would carry.\n'I definitely underestimated how hard this challenge was going to be,' Amy said.\nOther team members also struggled to keep the bars up and regretted the weight they had chosen.\nFirst out! Lynton dropped his 15kg weight within the first 10 minutes, losing the blue team's weight advantage of 10kg\nLynton dropped his 15kg weight within the first 10 minutes, losing the blue team's weight advantage of 10kg.\nJake dramatically dropped his 25kg weight next after saying: 'Everyone's starting to fatigue. My shoulder is burning like it's on fire.'\nShannan tried to encourage his contestants: '15 kilos, plus the bar is 26 kilos. The weight that you've got on your shoulders is the weight that you want to lose to get to your goal.'\nTwenty minutes into the challenge, the orange team were powering on with 90kg to blue team's 70kg.\n'Everyone's starting to fatigue': Jake dramatically dropped his 25kg weight soon after Lynton, claiming his shoulder was 'burning like it's on fire'\nShannan helped his contestants get their mind off the pain by pointing to the shoreline: 'Take your mind off it.
