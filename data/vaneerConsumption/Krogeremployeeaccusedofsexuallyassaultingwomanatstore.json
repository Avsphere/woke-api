The report says only that she was injured and sought medical help, and that she did not know the suspect.\nThe report lists charges for the suspect: rape and exploitation of a disabled adult. But it isn’t clear if he has been formally charged.\nHe hadn’t been arrested by Thursday afternoon.\nThe name of the suspect, who is 23, was redacted from the report.\nIn an emailed statement, Lt. Jennifer Ross said, in part: “This case is under investigation and additional details will not be released at this time.”\nKroger said, “safety is our first and foremost priority,” and the company is working with law enforcement.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/decatur-kroger-employee-accused-sexually-assaulting-woman-store/Koa77vLvJlZDN9RUNvqvHJ/"}
