The work is being carried out as part of the £8m Gateway project (Greenwich Automated Transport Environment) led by the UK's Transport Research Laboratory (TRL)\nRoutes have not yet been finalised, but it is thought the cars will run on pavements through residential areas and pass by North Greenwich tube station and the O2 arena.\nA consortium of British firms, including Westfield Sportscars, Heathrow Enterprises and Oxbotica, are working together to convert the pods into 'fully driverless shuttles'.\nThe work is being carried out as part of the £8m Gateway project (Greenwich Automated Transport Environment) led by the UK's Transport Research Laboratory (TRL).\nThe project has been jointly funded by Innovate UK and the industry, and the trial aims to assess the public's willingness to use autonomous vehicles in built-up areas, TRL said.\nRoutes have not yet been finalised, but it is thought the cars will run on pavements through residential areas and pass by North Greenwich tube station and the O2 arena (pictured)\nEarlier this week a similar trial took place in the Dutch town of Wageningen. The electric, driverless shuttle bus (pictured) took to Dutch public roads for the first time yesterday. The event involved taxiing six passengers along a 655ft (200 metre) stretch of road in the first trial of its kind worldwide\nTHE £8M GATEWAY PROJECT Gateway (Greenwich Automated Transport Environment) is an £8 million project, jointly funded by Innovate UK. Taking place in Greenwich, the project will trial a series of different use cases for automated vehicles, including driverless shuttles, autonomous valet parking and deliveries. By understanding public perception, reaction and engagement with the vehicles the trials will help introduce automated transport widely. The UltraPods have been operating at Terminal 5 for nearly five years, carrying 1.5 million passengers and completed three million kilometres during that time. Kit car manufacturer Westfield Sportcars will be responsible for design and testing, with Heathrow Enterprises looking after software engineering and Oxford University robotics lab spin-off Oxbotica will provide mapping and sensors to ensure safety.\n'The addition of three prominent and respected British organisations to the Gateway consortium further strengthens the UK's position as a leader in autonomous technologies,' said Professor Nick Reed, academy director at TRL and technical director for Gateway.\n'Each company brings a great deal of experience to the project which will prove valuable in helping us to understand how the public and industry will adapt to the use of automated vehicles in the UK Smart Mobility Living Lab test environment in Greenwich.\n'If the trials prove successful, we expect these iconic vehicles to become a familiar sight in many cities around the world.'\nThe UltraPods have been operating at Terminal 5 for nearly five years, carrying 1.5 million passengers and completed three million kilometres during that time.\nKit car manufacturer Westfield Sportcars will be responsible for design and testing, with Heathrow Enterprises looking after software engineering and Oxford University robotics lab spin-off Oxbotica will provide mapping and sensors to ensure safety.\nJulian Turner, boss of Westfield Sportscars said: 'We're really pleased to be a part of the Gateway consortium and are looking forward to bringing our innovative, lightweight, technology to a well-known and tried and tested platform.'\nOther trials taking place in Greenwich as part of the Gateway the project will include autonomous valet parking and deliveries. The driverless delivery vans will be used to move parcels between either warehouses and shops or stores and homes in south east London (illustrated)\nOther trials taking place in Greenwich as part of the Gateway the project will include autonomous valet parking and deliveries.\nThe driverless delivery vans will be used to move parcels between either warehouses and shops or stores and homes in south east London.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422307/London-s-driverless-cars-adapted-shuttle-pods-used-Heathrow-s-Terminal-5.html"}
