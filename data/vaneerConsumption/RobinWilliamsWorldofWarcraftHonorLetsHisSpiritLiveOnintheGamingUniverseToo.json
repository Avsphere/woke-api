Despite his recent passing, his impact is far too big for people to forget about him — even the popular video game World of Warcraft is seeking a way to commemorate the late entertainer. The Associated Press reports that Blizzard Entertainment plans on creating a character in World of Warcraft that will honor the comedian and actor. The Williams-based character will appear in \"Warlords of Draenor,\" an upcoming expansion of the video game.\nNothing's set in stone yet, but the game designers have begun talking about it. Lead game designer Ion Hazzikostas said:\nWe haven't decided, but it will most likely be a character inspired by him or some of his favorite roles of the past [..] all of us are massive Robin Williams fans. We love and appreciate his work. We grew up watching his movies and stand-up. We knew he was an avid [World of Warcraft] player, which was awesome. We have a number of pop culture references and things that reflect great figures of our time here and there. We're just thinking about the appropriate and right way to do it.\nThis was not without ample support — there was initially a petition on Change.org to honor Williams through the gaming community. Williams was a big gamer — so big, in fact, that he even named his daughter Zelda, after the titular character in The Legend of Zelda.\nThis is simply further proof that anyone who was involved in any aspect of Williams life, be it through comedy, acting, or the gaming community, was truly touched by him in some way, and is now seeking a way to honor all the joy that he brought to them.","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35947-robin-williams-world-of-warcraft-honor-lets-his-spirit-live-on-in-the-gaming-universe-too"}
