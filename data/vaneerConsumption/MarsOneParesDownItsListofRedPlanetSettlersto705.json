These candidates are to be interviewed by Mars One's selection committee. Several teams of four will be chosen to undergo training for one-way missions to Mars, with the first launch set for as early as 2024. The plan calls for successive crews to set up a permanent colony on Mars.\nThe multibillion-dollar cost of the project is supposed to be covered primarily by media deals and sponsorships for reality-TV programs focusing on the preparations for the Mars missions. The candidates paid an initial registration fee but are not expected to be charged for their training or flight.\nIn this week's update, Mars One said it was still negotiating with media companies.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/mars-one-pares-down-its-list-red-planet-settlers-705-n98726"}
