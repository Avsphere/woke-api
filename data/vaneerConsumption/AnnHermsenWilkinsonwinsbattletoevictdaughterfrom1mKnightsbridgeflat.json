with even her two ex-husbands testifying against her.\nShe was 'understandably upset and genuinely puzzled' when events were dredged up which dated back even to before her daughter's birth in an attempt to blacken her name.\n'Caroline Hermsen and the witnesses called by her sought to portray Ann as vindictive, untrustworthy, manipulative, and unreliable as a witness of truth,' he added.\nShe was serially accused of cruelly neglecting Caroline when she was a baby, staying in bed when she should have been seeing her off to school and even faking her own death.\nShe was said to have dumped baby Caroline on her sister for three months and to have 'intimidated' her in her teens - even trying to ensure she failed her A-levels.\nBut Ann described those claims as 'simply ridiculous' and told the court she had had 'no control' over her daughter since she was 18.\nJudge Monty said that either Ann or Caroline was not telling the truth - 'there is no half-way position whereby one or both of them could be mistaken'.\nCaroline was the liar, he ruled, roundly rejecting claims that her mother had ever promised to put the flat in her name.\nIssuing a possession order, he concluded: 'I find as a fact that Ann did not tell her daughter that the flat was, or would be, hers.\n'On the contrary, as Caroline was in truth always aware, the flat belonged to her mother.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393956/Wealthy-divorcee-wins-court-battle-evict-daughter-1m-Knightsbridge-flat.html"}
