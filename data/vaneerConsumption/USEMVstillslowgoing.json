As of Q4 2015, there were 394 million EMV chip cards in the US. Although this is a massive number of cards, it still only represents 26% of the market.\nEven though EMV chip cards are present in the US, usage of these cards still remains low. US EMV transactions have increased year-over-year, but still represent a very small portion of payments — only 7% of card-present transactions were through EMV in the US in 2016, which is up from 0.26% in 2015. This is much lower than than other regions, which have been quite receptive to EMV transactions — EMV payments account for at least 75% of card present transactions in Europe; 88% in Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 89% in Africa and the Middle East.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-emv-still-slow-going-2016-12"}
