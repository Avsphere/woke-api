Fat is also a key component of a well-balanced diet, as long as it's the good kind.\nThose frozen meals and packaged snacks advertised to be 'low in fat' are packed with hidden sugars to help boost missing flavour.\nCarbs have long been seen as the devil when it comes to weight loss, but there's nothing healthy about cutting out these energy boosters\nThe key is to pick good carbs, like brown rice (pictured) and oats, that will help you feel fuller longer, curbing your appetite in the long run\nInstead it's better off to eat foods that have healthy sources of fat that will keep you feeling satisfied, whether that be avocado on your toast or Greek yoghurt.\nThen there is the myth that sometimes eliminating food completely, albeit temporarily, is the best way to get lean quick.\nJuicing is yet another diet craze we have Hollywood to thank, but don't be fooled by the pretty pictures of plastic containers in bright greens and yellows.\nMost of these juices, especially those heavy with fruit, are packed with sugar that won't leave you feeling full for very long at all.\nThey also lack the nutrients that will help keep your body working at its highest potential.\nIf you don't want to let go of juices completely, though, have no fear. Just keep them simple, add yoghurt for protein, and trying to stick to vegetables for less sugar.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4318384/Healthy-habits-causing-gain-weight.html"}
