The union has been around for more than 80 years, and currently boasts a membership of approximately 60,000 people.”\nThe use of taco trucks is a reference to a threat by a Latino Trump supporter last month that if his chosen candidate loses, the country would see a “taco truck on every corner,” thanks to increased illegal immigration and Mexicans’ allegedly “dominant culture.”\nTrump’s hotel is frequently targeted by unions and Democrats prior to political debates and elections. Last October, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended a union rally outside the Trump Hotel, in support of efforts to unionize the hotel’s workforce.\nIn February, prior to the state’s Republican caucuses, unions again picketed the hotel, which site just off Las Vegas Boulevard (the “Strip”), on Fashion Show Drive.\nThe Trump Hotel’s culinary workforce reportedly joined Local 226 recently, but the hotel’s management has declined to recognize the union for the purposes of collective bargaining.\nUnions became a dominant force in local politics as Las Vegas expanded rapidly in the 1990s, and remain so despite the deep downturn in the city’s fortunes after the 2008 recession.\nThe Trump campaign’s Hispanic outreach director, A.J. Delgado, told Buzzfeed: “I never, EVER turn down a chance to eat some good tacos.”\nThe protest is not expected to block access to the hotel itself, where the Trump family typically stays when in town, and which would likely be protected by Secret Service.\nJoel B.
