He says the IS militants seized two districts from the Taliban.\nThe Taliban and IS are both fighting to overthrow Afghanistan's U.S.-backed government and impose a harsh version of Islamic rule, but they are bitterly split over leadership and tactics. The IS affiliate is largely made up of disgruntled former Taliban fighters.\nAbdul Hafiz Khashyee, a police official, says the fighting took place in a remote area and there were no reports of civilian casualties.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4447596/Islamic-State-Taliban-clash-Afghanistan-dozens-killed.html"}
