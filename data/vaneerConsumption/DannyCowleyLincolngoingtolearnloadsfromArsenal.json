We are determined to come out better from this experience.\n'We respect that, sooner or later, we will be old news, fish and chip paper, but that is fine by us as long as when the dust does settles we have learnt from the experience, that we are better managers and better people as a consequence of it.\n'If we can play at our very best under all of the scrutiny of playing against world-class players, in front of 60,000 people at a fantastic stadium, then we will be better individually and collectively, so that is what we will be aiming to do.'\nAfter beating Guiseley and Altrincham, Lincoln have defeated four league teams in a row\nLINCOLN CITY'S FA CUP RUN SO FAR Oct 13: Lincoln City 0-0 Guiseley (Fourth qualifying round) Oct 18: Guiseley 1-2 Lincoln City (Fourth qualifying round replay) Nov 5: Lincoln City 2-1 Altrincham (First round) Dec 5: Lincoln 3-2 Oldham Athletic (Second round) Jan 7: Ipswich 2-2 Lincoln (Third round) Jan 17: Lincoln 1-0 Ipswich Town (Third round replay) Jan 28: Lincoln 3-1 Brighton and Hove Albion (Fourth round) Feb 18: Burnley 0-1 Lincoln (Fifth round)\nWhile being realistic over the prospect of his team upsetting the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium, where the Imps are set to bring some 9,000 supporters, Cowley is determined not to let the occasion get to his side.\n'We understand that the chance is probably one in a thousand, but we will go there with the belief that this can be the one time,' said Cowley, whose squad trained at West Ham on Friday.\n'We will go there with a game plan and try to execute it. I would never do the disservice to my players to tell them to wake up on Saturday morning and just enjoy the day. We are professional people, we work every day for this, it is our lives.\n'We have to put emotion to one side and will have clear minds on Saturday morning. We know what is in front of us, but it is not every Saturday you wake up with such an opportunity.'\nArsenal come into the cup tie on the back of 5-1 home trashing by Bayern Munich as they crashed out of the Champions League and left manager Arsene Wenger facing more questions over his future.\nLincoln made history by being the first non-league team since 1914 to reach the last eight\nWhile the Gunners were being taken apart on Tuesday night, Lincoln saw off Braintree Town 4-0 to keep themselves on course for promotion.\nDespite all of the clamour surrounding their FA Cup heroics, Cowley will not lose sight of the bigger picture.\n'The goal this season was to to get this wonderful football club back into the Football League,' he said.\n'The job has become tougher because of the journey we have had in the FA Cup, and also our run in the FA Trophy. You don't get marathon runners celebrating at the 20-mile mark do you?\n'We are three-quarters of the way through the season and we have achieved nothing yet, that is the reality of it.'\nLincoln are six points clear on top of the National League after beating Braintree on Tuesday\nOn loan Peterborough forward Lee Angol marked his Lincoln debut with a hat-trick against Braintree, but is cup-tied having played against Chelsea for Posh in the third round.\nJosh Ginnelly, the on-loan Burnley midfielder, is also ineligible after his appearance for Walsall earlier in the competition.\nHowever, Lincoln have strengthened their squad with the loan signings of left-back Riccardo Calder from Aston Villa and goalkeeper Ross Etheridge from Doncaster.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4301356/Danny-Cowley-Lincoln-going-learn-loads-Arsenal.html"}
