A narcotics K-9 alerted officers to the drugs hidden in the vehicle’s dashboard. The 23 pounds of fentanyl recovered was estimated to be worth approximately $378,000.\nFentanyl is 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more than heroin.\nSome estimates suggest that as little as .25 milligrams of fentanyl can kill a human, although most estimates consider a lethal dose to be in the range of 2 milligrams to 3 milligrams.\nThe latest statistics from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) indicate that fentanyl is the largest drug threat in the United States, killing 44 people per day.\nRyan Saavedra is a contributor for Breitbart Texas and can be found on Twitter at @RealSaavedra.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/border/2017/05/01/mexican-man-arrested-nearly-400k-fentanyl/"}
