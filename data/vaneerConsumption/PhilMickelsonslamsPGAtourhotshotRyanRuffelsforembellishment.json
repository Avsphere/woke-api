'He's young, and he's got some things to learn.'\nPhil Mickelson (pictrued earlier this week) has slammed 17-year-old Australian hot shot Ryan Ruffels for 'high school stuff' on the eve of his debut on the PGA Tour\n'One of them is you don't discuss certain things. You don't discuss specifics of what you play for. And you certainly don't embellish and create a false amount just for your own benefit.\n'So those things right there are ... that's high school stuff,' Mickelson said. 'And he's going to have to top doing that now that he's out on the PGA Tour.'\nIn a story two weeks ago in Sydney Morning Herald about the teen turning pro, Ruffels told of a round he played with Mickelson and his brother, Tim, the golf coach at Arizona State.\nPhil was acting as an interim coach at the time to help his brother out.\nMickelson admonished the teenager (pictured in San Diego this week) for 'embellishing' a story about he won $5,000 by winning a round between the pair at Torrey Pines in California. He is set to make his US PGA debut\nHe said Mickelson told him on the first tee, 'I don't wake up this early to play for any less than $2,500.' Ruffels said Mickelson gave him 2-to-1 odds, and that the teen birdied six of the last seven holes to win the match, earning $5,000.\nTwo days later, however, Wasserman Media Group issued a statement over concerns that it might have involved NCAA recruiting violations by saying Ruffels never had any intentions going to college and that the 'friendly wager' and barrage of birdies was 'a bit overdone and becoming a media fish story.'\nRuffels posted on Golf Channel's Instagram account that the story was 'very inaccurate.'\n'The wager amount has also been exaggerated out of proportion,' Ruffels said.\nRuffels is playing on a sponsor's exemption at the Farmers Insurance Open.\nRuffels told an Austlian newspaper of a round he played with Mickelson and his brother, Tim, (pictured in December 2013) the golf coach at Arizona State\nThe five-time Masters winner (pictured putting on his green jacket in 2010) urged the player not to create a false account of himself for his own benefit","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3420232/Mickelson-admonishes-Aussie-teen-embellishment.html"}
