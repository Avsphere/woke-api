It’s truly extremism, Islamic extremism, which is something that we must confront, and we must correct the Islamic rhetoric. I’m a Muslim man, and it’s very very hard on me to say what I’m saying, but this is the truth. It is really important that we state the truth, so that we could correct it.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/09/21/egypts-president-we-should-use-islamic-extremism-as-a-term-we-must-correct-the-islamic-rhetoric/"}
