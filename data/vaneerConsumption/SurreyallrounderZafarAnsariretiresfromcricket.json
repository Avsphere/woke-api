The left-arm orthodox bowler had been at Surrey since the age of eight and had combined his career at the county with academics.\nAnsari graduated from Cambridge with a double first in politics, philosophy and sociology in 2013 before gaining a distinction in his master's degree from Royal Holloway, University of London last year.\nZafar Ansari has announced his retirement from cricket to pursue other ambitions\nThe 25-year-old had been at Surrey since he was eight and combined cricket with academics\nFIRST-CLASS CAREER County: Surrey Matches: 71 Cap: 2014 BATTING Runs: 3009 Highest score: 112 Average: 29.79 BOWLING Wickets: 128 Best figures: 6/30 Average: 35.87\nThe left-hander was always open about his ambitions to pursue other avenues outside of cricket and said that when the time was right to leave the game, he would.\n'After seven years as a professional cricketer and almost two decades in total playing the game, I have decided to bring my cricket career to an end,' Ansari said in a statement'\n'This has been a very difficult decision to make and I have not made it lightly. I started playing for Surrey at the age of eight and the club has been a hugely important part of my life since then.\n'Surrey have always completely supported me and I am extremely grateful to the club for their backing over the years. It is, therefore, with great sadness that I say goodbye.\nHis retirement comes just three games into the new season, with Surrey top of Division One\nAnsari took five wickets in three Tests for England against Bangladesh last winter\nENGLAND CAREER Debut: 28 October, 2016 (vs Bangladesh, Dhaka) Tests: 3 BATTING Runs: 49 Highest score: 32 Average: 9.80 BOWLING Wickets: 5 Best figures: 2/76 Average: 55\n'Nevertheless, I have always been clear that when the time was right for me to move on I would, and that time has now come. While the timing may come as a surprise, I have always maintained that cricket was just one part of my life and that I have other ambitions that I want to fulfil.\n'With that in mind, I am now exploring another career, potentially in law, and to achieve this I have to begin the process now.'\nAnsari leaves Surrey just three games into the season with his beloved county sitting top of Division One.\nHe was one of the exciting and hotly tipped prospects to challenge for the spinner's role in Joe Root's England side - taking five wickets during his three Tests last winter.\nHowever his absence for Surrey will be felt most. He is the only spinner to take 90 wickets and score over 2,000 runs since 2014 - which placed him highly on the England radar. An ever-present in the side whose contributions with both bat and ball will be difficult to replace.\nAnsari, who gained a double first from Cambridge, suggested he may pursue a career in law\nSurrey's director of cricket and former England captain Alec Stewart called Ansari's decision to walk away from the game 'exceptionally tough but considered'.\n'To retire at such a young age when his cricket career was progressing very nicely, earning a Test debut against Bangladesh last winter, proves that he has given great thought in deciding to walk away from the professional game,' Stewart added.\nThe former England wicket-keeper spoke on behalf of the club by saying he will be sorely missed but wholeheartedly welcomed back at the Kia Oval.\nEngland international and fellow all-rounder Moeen Ali also tweeted after the announcement, saying: 'What a great guy and a pleasure to have toured with him. Wish him the best.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-4447290/Surrey-rounder-Zafar-Ansari-retires-cricket.html"}
