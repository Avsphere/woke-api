He added, “I’m an ardent defender of free speech, because I don’t want anybody telling me what book I should write, and what speech I should give.”\nDyson then stated that when he went to DePaul University after Yiannopoulos’ speech there, “It wasn’t just free speech. If it was free-speech merely, expressing ideas that are even abhorrent to the masses of people there, that’s all right. … But many black students were…called the n-word They were disrespected. They were physically assaulted. … I understand people being against what happened at Berkeley, but also be against the inciting of a kind of riotous spirit where a guy goes around the country spewing the worst kind of venom.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/02/03/michael-eric-dyson-i-understand-people-being-against-what-happened-at-berkeley-but-also-be-against-milos-riotous-spirit/"}
