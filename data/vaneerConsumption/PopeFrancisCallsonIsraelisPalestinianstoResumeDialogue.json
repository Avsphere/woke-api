The whole Middle East urgently needs peace!”\nAlong with his appeal to Israelis and Palestinians, the Pope also encouraged dialogue in Venezuela and a “full implementation” of the agreements aimed at restoring peace in Libya.\nHe likewise reiterated his support for efforts to renew peaceful civil coexistence in Sudan and South Sudan, and in the Central African Republic, “all plagued by ongoing armed conflicts, massacres and destruction,” and expressed hope that the recent agreement in the Democratic Republic of Congo might help enable political leaders to pursue reconciliation and dialogue between all elements of civil society.\nIn his address, Francis denounced “the deplorable arms trade” as well as “the never-ending race to create and spread ever more sophisticated weaponry.” He singled out the experiments being conducted on the Korean Peninsula, which he said “destabilize the entire region and raise troubling questions for the entire international community about the risk of a new nuclear arms race.”\nThe spread of weapons, he contended, “including those of small calibre,” aggravates conflicts and generates a widespread sense of insecurity and fear. “This is all the more dangerous in times, like our own, of social uncertainty and epochal changes,” he said.\nFor its part, the Holy See “will always be ready to cooperate with those committed to ending current conflicts and to offer support and hope to all who suffer,” he concluded.\nFollow Thomas D.
