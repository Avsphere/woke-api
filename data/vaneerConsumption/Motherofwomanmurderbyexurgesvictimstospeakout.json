In a harrowing 999 call, the friend who discovered her body said: 'I knew this was coming. Her ex is a complete psychopath.'\nYesterday Miss Ruggles' mother Dr Susan Hills said: 'I've been living through an endless nightmare. I've failed Alice as a mother. All I want to do is hide away and give up on life.'\nWomen's charities said that instead of being protected, Miss Ruggles was 'victim-blamed' by officers and 'made to feel like a burden'. She was angry about the police's lack of action, telling her sister Emma: 'They will f****** respond once he has f****** stabbed me.'\nAlice Ruggles, 24, was killed despite reporting her stalker to the police\nMiss Ruggles had contacted police twice in the weeks before her death, the court heard\nDhillon was ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years in jail after a Newcastle Crown Court jury found him guilty in under three hours.\nMiss Ruggles, who attended £11,600-a-year Leicester High School for Girls where her mother is head of maths, first contacted the soldier online in October 2015.\nThey met in person in January last year, but the 'intense' relationship turned sour when he became manipulative and controlling.\nMiss Ruggles broke up with Dhillon in the summer after she caught him cheating with a woman he met on the Tinder dating app.\nBut he was 'unable to take no for an answer' and began stalking her. He told her he would kill himself, threatened to publish intimate photos online, and hacked into her Facebook account.\nThe trial was played this harrowing 999 call made by Miss Ruggles's flatmate after the murder\nDhillon changed his story a number of times after his arrest before he went on trial\nA fortnight before the murder, Dhillon travelled 120 miles from his barracks in Scotland to his ex-girlfriend's flat in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, to leave chocolates and flowers on the windowsill.\nThe visit was accompanied by a deranged voicemail, in which he repeatedly told her he did not want to kill her.\nMiss Ruggles contacted the police and Dhillon was given a formal harassment warning – but a few days later he sent her a parcel of photos and a pleading letter. She spoke to officers again on October 7, but no action was taken.\nGrief: Alice's mother Dr Susan Hills leaves court. Above: Trimaan Dhillon\nRecalling how Miss Ruggles felt let down, her housemate Maxine McGill said: 'Alice said she felt palmed off, she was asked the question, 'What do you want us to do about it?' She said, 'I don't know, that is why I am calling ... I was told that if anything further happened I was to get in touch'. She said basically it was a waste of time.'\nOn the afternoon of October 12, Dhillon again drove the 120 miles from Glencorse Barracks, near Edinburgh, to his ex-girlfriend's flat. CCTV footage from the day showed Miss Ruggles smiling as she left work as an office co-ordinator at Sky in Newcastle.\nThe soldier broke in through the back window, grabbed a six-inch kitchen knife and, having wrestled Miss Ruggles into the shower room, slashed her neck at least six times. At 6ft 1in and 12-and-a-half stone, the 2 Scots signaller – who went by the name Harry – was nearly a foot taller and three stone heavier than his victim.\nHe fled and Miss Ruggles' body was found minutes later by Miss McGill, who made a desperate 999 call. She could be heard shouting: 'Alice! Alice! Alice! Oh my God, she's dead, she's dead.'\nShe told the operator: 'I've just come back and she's covered in blood. She's covered in blood in the bathroom. I cannot look ... please help. I'm so scared.'\nThe jury were played these two calls to police which Miss Ruggles made before her murder\nThrough tears, Miss McGill added: 'She put in a complaint about her ex ... and they said we're going to do nothing and now this has happened. Her ex-boyfriend Harry Dhillon. I think it's definitely him. He was threatening to do bad things to her.'\nDhillon had previously intimidated another ex-partner, becoming the subject of a restraining order for spitting in her face when she broke off their engagement.\nNorthumbria Police's failure to protect Miss Ruggles is now being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid, said: 'This is a worrying snapshot of victim-blaming within the criminal justice system. It is the job of the police to build the case for the victim – not the other way around.\nFinal hours: Alice Ruggles and a colleague leave work at the Sky Office in Newcastle\n'The response a woman gets from the police is absolutely critical to whether or not she feels safe enough to go through with a prosecution. Instead, Alice was made to feel like a burden.'\nDetective Chief Inspector Lisa Theaker, of Northumbria Police, said at the time no one knew the level of threat that Dhillon posed.\n'Alice didn't fully understand his level of behaviour and the stalking and the lengths of behaviour he was going to,' she added. 'The family and friends won't have fully understood it either.\n'We went through a risk assessment. We would not have been able to predict at that stage that he would go on to murder Alice.'\nDhillon (left), pictured with former prime minister David Cameron, was a signaller with his regiment who had passed some of the courses to join the special forces, the jury heard\nPolice at the scene where Dhillon attacked and killed hi ex-girlfriend last year\nCOUNTDOWN TO HORROR OCTOBER 11, 2015: Alice Ruggles first talks to Lance Corporal Trimaan Dhillon on social media while he is serving in Afghanistan.

Alice! Alice!'\nShe tells the operator: 'She's covered in blood in the bathroom. I cannot look.'\nAmid tears, she then adds: 'She's blue. She's not breathing, there's blood everywhere and her leg looks broke... she's dead.'\nDhillon - whose actual first name is Trimaan - harassed Miss Ruggles after they split up, hacking into her phone and bombarding her with emails.\nThe 24-year-old feared for her safety after Dhillon left gifts on her window sill, the court heard\nNewcastle Crown Court also heard a voice message Dhillon had left for Miss Ruggles after he drove from Edinburgh to Gateshead to leave chocolates and flowers on her window sill.\nHis actions prompted her to phone police on October 1, telling them that she had heard knocking on her doors and windows and was worried about Dhillon's actions.\nShe told them: 'He's hacked into my Facebook and sent me messages... I had a knock at my door, he sent me a message saying 'I've been in your garden since 5'.\n'There was a knock at my door and when I looked there was no one there. And then it happened again. And then he's come round the back, knocked on my bedroom window. He's been outside and left some flowers and chocolate on my bedroom window.\n'He's left, he's not done anything but I'm just concerned. My friends have been telling me to call the police.
