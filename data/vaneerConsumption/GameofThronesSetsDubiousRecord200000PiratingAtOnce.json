While we don't mean to condone piracy, the sheer scale of it here deserves comment. A few years ago such numbers might have been unthinkable, but now they're commonplace — and only getting bigger.\nAnd while some pirates may just be looking to get out of paying for an HBO Go subscription, it's worth noting that piracy is a worldwide phenomenon, and some of those 207,054 could easily live in an area where \"Game of Thrones\" is not available. Where once they might have had to wait for DVDs to come out months later, now they can watch for free — and only an hour or two after the original broadcast. It's likely hard to say no to that.\nNo doubt HBO wants to turn those hundreds of thousands of pirates into paying viewers. Will they be able to? It's hard to say. But one thing's for sure: there are plenty more where they came from.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/game-thrones-sets-dubious-record-200-000-pirating-once-n98786"}
