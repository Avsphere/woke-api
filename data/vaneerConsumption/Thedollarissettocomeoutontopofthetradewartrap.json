For FX investors, watching the shape of the US yield curve goes beyond just gauging recession risks - it can also help to provide a bit of context around the current trading environment. And right now, the flattening of the US yield curve is telling of the two conflicting world's that investors are having to contend with:\n(1) current economic optimism that is fuelling central bank policy normalisation and higher short-term rates; and\n(2) longer-term pessimism over the global economy that is spurring a stealth flight to safety\nAs the Bank of Canada's Governor Poloz put it yesterday, much of the flattening yield curve dynamics can be chalked down to 'absolutely huge' demand for longer-dated bonds that has risen as a result of trade war and geopolitical tensions. What we will continue to see this summer is the narrative switching between these two broad themes - or what we call the 'Trade War Trap'. And in the FX space, the evidence suggests that the USD wins in the 'Trade War Trap' world - with the Fed leading the way when it comes to policy normalisation and US Treasuries still the go-to haven asset.\nAs for today, bond markets will turn their attention to the latest US CPI inflation release; while there are risks of a 3% headline CPI print (core at 2.3%), it's worth remembering that high inflation and a late-cycle US economy confirms the 'Trade War Trap' that we're in - short-term optimism and long-term pessimism. The breakout in USD/JPY suggests that FX investors are happy to focus on the signals from the short-end of the US curve for now.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-dollar-is-set-to-come-out-on-top-of-the-trade-war-trap-2018-7"}
