(Most Likely, Yes)'.\nOn dealing with a manterrupter, she says one solution is to carry on talking until the other person is silenced into submission.\nAlternatively, you could lean into the table, as this makes you seem more assertive, meaning others will be less likely to interrupt you mid-conversation, Bennett says.\nOtherwise, you could explain to the manterrupter that he is butting in and insist he stops doing so.\nThe terms were decoded in piece on workplace sexism featuring author Jessica Bennett (left, at a launch in 2016). Right: Gwyneth Paltrow pictured in London on June 22, 2016\nDO KEEP UP! THE LATEST BUZZWORDS Manterrupter - Regularly interrupts when you speak. Bropriators - Takes the credit for somebody else's work. Womenemy - Views other women as competition and undermines them.\nBattling bropriators merits two responses, notes Ms Bennett.\n... AND THE OLD CLASSICS Mansplaining - Explaining something to someone, typically a woman, in a patronising or condescending manner. Manspreading - Sitting with your legs wide open so you take up more than one seat, usually on public transport.\nOne technique is to publicly thank the person for using your concept - thus reminding everyone that it is yours.\nMs Bennett also recommends discussing with other female colleagues about the importance of standing up for each other's ideas.\nBut none of this is of any use when dealing with a womenemy.\nHowever, you should resist the temptation to act aggressively and instead remind the womenemy of your joint interests in fighting the patriarchy.\nGoop is well known for offering a stream of unorthodox health, wellbeing and relationship tips alongside bizarre products since it was founded by mother-of-two Gwyneth in 2008.\nIn February, it urged women to burn their bras, saying they could be carrying the 'negative energy and memories' of your failed relationships.\nGoop is well known for offering a stream of unorthodox tips, including burning your bras after a relationship\nThe ritual was detailed on the site by relationship expert Suzannah Galland, who explained it was most effective when performed during a full moon.\nOther pearls of wisdom from Goop include the introduction of stone 'sex eggs' said to improve women's orgasms to its online store, and a guide to vaginal steaming.\nGoop has also recommended kitchen 'essentials' like the Kamado-San Donabe Rice Cooker - just $210 (£172).\nAnd the website's 'easy work-morning routine' has 10 steps - starting with applying $110 (£90) organic facial oil.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4314046/Gwyneth-Paltrow-s-Goop-pens-guide-fighting-sexism.html"}
