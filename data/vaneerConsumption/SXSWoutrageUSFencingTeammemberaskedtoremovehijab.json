This was one volunteer who made an insensitive request and that person has been removed for the duration of the event. We are embarrassed by this and have apologized to Ibtihaj in person, and sincerely regret this incident.‚Äù\nThe image with Ibtihaj Muhammad's pinned tweet encourages followers, \"Chase your dreams until your dreams become your reality #RoadtoRio #TeamUSA \"\nNot only was the Olympic hopeful asked to lose her religious head covering, she ended up with the wrong creds:\nSo far her updates have been retweeted about 4,000 times - sure to catch festival organizers' attention. We'll keep an eye out for updates, or an official response.\nFor now here's some of the commentary the incident has sparked:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/buzz/sxsw-outrage-fencing-team-member-asked-remove-hijab/2V930fXrBaTMQByLt6Uz4H/"}
