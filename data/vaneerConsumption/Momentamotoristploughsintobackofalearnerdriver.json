There's a crest on the right that means you can't see that well.\n'Next thing I know we feel this massive shunt in the back of us and it threw me face-first into the dashboard.\n'Thankfully neither of us suffered anything worse than whiplash but it was terrifying for the poor learner.\nThe dashcam even catches the moment the reckless driver ends up smashing herself in the head with the phone at the moment of impact\n'As we are hit all I remember is my sunglasses coming off and uttering the occasional swear words.\n'I then checked to see if Lauren was ok. She was very quiet, in shock. The blonde girl was at my window by this point.\n'I get out and she immediately said 'who's at fault here?'. I told her she was as she'd ran into the back of us.\n'She said 'what are you stopping for?' and I told her you can't take a roundabout at 30mph.'\nThe incident happened near the Moss Bank pub in Scafell Road, St Helens, last June.\nMr Eckersley, who set up Swift Drive Driving School three years ago, said he hoped the clip would serve as a lesson to those who continue to use phones behind the wheel.\nThe damage caused to Mr Eckersley's car following the crash at a roundabout in St Helens\nMr Eckersley said: 'There's so much technology these days that mean you don't have to hold your phone while driving, I don't understand why people still do it.\n'From the video, it looks like this girl sped up and possibly hit the wrong pedal because she wasn't concentrating. She got out looking really cross and immediately blamed us. She had a small dog in the car with her too.\n'I told her I thought she was on the phone and would be checking the film. That's when she went quiet. You can see her scratching her head at the end of the footage, wondering what she's done.\n'I had to cancel all my remaining lessons for the next three days, losing almost Â£500. I was in pain all weekend and had to go to A&E because of the pain in my back and shoulders.\n'I can't stress enough how dangerous it is to text and drive. There's no excuse really.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446884/Moment-motorist-ploughs-learner-driver.html"}
