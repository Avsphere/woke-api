Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus. It was first noted by veterinary scientists in the early-1900s. Since mid-December 2003, a growing number of countries, starting in south east Asia, have reported outbreaks of bird flu in chickens and ducks. The virus can spread rapidly through flocks of domestic poultry. Infections in several species of wild birds and in pigs have also been reported. Bird flu is unique in that it can be transmitted directly from birds to humans. There are 15 different strains of the virus. It is the H5N1 strain which is infecting humans and causing high death rates. How does it affect humans? Humans can catch bird flu directly through close contact with live infected birds and those who work with infected chickens are most at risk. The virus is excreted, and people may inhale these germs as dust when the droppings dry out. The virus cannot be passed from human to human. However, a Vietnamese study has shown it is adapting to infect humans. If the virus mutates into a form that can be passed between humans, it could result in the infection spreading rapidly across the globe. This was the situation during the great influenza pandemic of 1918-1919. A completely new influenza virus subtype emerged and spread around the globe in around four to six months, killing an estimated 40â€“50million people. What are the symptoms? In humans, symptoms include fever sore throats and coughing. People can also develop conjunctivitis. It takes three to five days to develop symptoms. The H5N1 strain is the most deadly type of the bird flu virus with 50 per cent of victims dying. Chickens may die without showing any symptoms but typically birds suddenly show swelling about the eyes and ear lobes. Should we stop eating chicken? No. There is no evidence that cooked poultry can infect people. You need to be in close proximity to live, infected birds to catch the current mutation of the virus. Campaigners have recently urged consumers to keep buying free range chicken even if they are moved indoors in the future due to bird flu fears. They claim conditions for the poultry will still be of a higher standard than battery hens.\nThere are nine known subtypes of the H5 virus, and birds affected by low pathogenic strains may not cause disease and only exhibit mild symptoms such as ruffled feathers or a decrease in egg production.\nMost types of bird flu are harmless to humans but two types - H5N1 and H7N9 - have caused serious concerns.\nOther bird flu strains, including H7N7, have infected people, but these have been very rare or have only rarely caused severe illness, experts said.\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, which originated in Asia, has been reported in 16 countries. About 650 people in 15 countries have been infected with H5N1 since 2003.\nThis strain, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate worldwide, causes fever and cough, acute respiratory distress, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nComplications may result in severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.\nEight countries suspended imports of French poultry after the H5N1 bird flu virus was detected in early December.\nThe virus killed 22 chickens that were kept in a family's yard at Biras in southwestern France.\nA 26-year-old woman in Shenzhen, southern China died last week after being infected by the H5N6 strain.\nHong Kong culled thousands of chickens and suspended imports of live poultry from mainland China in December 2014 after a H7 bird flu strain was discovered in live chickens.\nThree other cases of bird flu were reported in other parts of the UK in 2015.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393630/Avian-flu-outbreak-Fife-Scotland-officials-urge-farmers-stay-vigilant.html"}
