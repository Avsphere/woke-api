No militant group has claimed responsibility for the firing.\nGaza is ruled by the Islamist militant Hamas group. Since a 50-day war between Israel and Gaza militants in the summer of 2014, a cease-fire has largely held. But militants in Gaza occasionally fire rockets at Israel's south, and Israel usually retaliates.\nMost rocket fire since the war has come from smaller rivals of Hamas. Israel holds Hamas responsible for attacks from the territory.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319106/Israel-strikes-Hamas-targets-militant-fire-Israel.html"}
