Only two of the five vehicles had dashcams that actually captured video.\nOn June 17, 2014, police technicians reported fixing a dashcam wiring issue in police vehicle No. 6412, the squad shared by Van Dyke and his partner Joseph Walsh.\nIt was fixed around three months after it was reported broken, records show.\nA day later, the same vehicle's dashcam system was reported busted again.\nThis time it took until October 8, 2014, to complete repairs of what technicians described as 'intentional damage'.\nVan Dyke's squad car dashcam didn't record the video of the deadly shooting that went viral. Two captured footage but all of the five patrol vehicles at the scene failed to record any audio\nVan Dyke (mugshot left) has been charged with first-degree murder in Laquan's (right) shooting. He fired at the teenager 16 times in October 2014\nTwelve days days later, on October 20, dashcam video recorded from squad car No. 6412 showed Van Dyke shooting and killing McDonald.\nHowever no audio on the tape was picked up.\nThe video that went viral, and led to Van Dyke's murder charge was taken from a different squad car, but it, too, had no audio.\nThe dashcam in police vehicle No. 8489, shared by officers Thomas Gaffney and Joseph McElligott the night of McDonald's shooting, recorded 37 'event videos' in October 2014, and had an operational dashcam the night of the shooting.\nBut 'due to disk error' no video was recorded at the shooting scene, according to police reports.\nOn November 21, 2014, a review of 10 videos downloaded from Van Dyke's squad car dashcam determined it was 'apparent â€¦ that personnel have failed to sync the MICs [sic]'.\nThe records show Van Dyk and Walsh asked for their dashcam to be repaired five days before Laquan's shooting.\nHowever on October 31, technicians found 'no problems' with the equipment, DNAinfo reported.\nVan Dyke has been charged with first-degree murder in Laquan's shooting.\nWalsh, who backed up Van Dyke throughout the investigation, has been placed on desk duty as the investigation into his conduct continues.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421247/Cop-shot-killed-Laquan-McDonald-hail-16-bullets-broken-dashcam-deliberately-unplugged-microphone-records-show.html"}
