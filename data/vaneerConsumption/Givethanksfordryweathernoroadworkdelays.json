The coldest temperature reported on the holiday was in 1911, when the mercury dipped to 21. The warmest holiday on record was in 1908, when the high reached 76 on Thanksgiving Day.\nWhile there’s no risk of snowflakes this Thanksgiving, Atlanta has recorded a trace of Thanksgiving Day snow, in 1936 and again in 1938.\nMinton said that after several mostly sunny days, clouds will be on the increase on Sunday, with a 20 percent chance of rain later in the day.\n» Check the full forecast and track changes\nAt least motorists headed home from the long holiday weekend Sunday won’t have roadwork delays to deal with, as the Georgia Department of Transportation has suspended construction-related lane closures through 10 p.m. Sunday.\n“Like watching televised Thanksgiving Day parades and football, minimizing lane closures for projects under construction is a Georgia DOT holiday tradition,” GDOT spokeswoman Annalysce Baker said. “The restriction is implemented to offset increased holiday traffic.”\n» For updated traffic information, listen to News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB and follow @ajcwsbtraffic on Twitter.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/weather/give-thanks-for-dry-weather-roadwork-delays/CsAVLdzQWNZ0bQBs5raBXP/"}
