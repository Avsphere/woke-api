Members of the 'Santisimo Sacramento' brotherhood are pictured attending a mass in Penalsordo, Spain\n'In a mass, sending someone to hell for being gay? On public television, which we all pay for. No thanks,' Iglesias wrote.\nWhile Catholicism remains deeply embedded in Spanish culture, regular church attendance in Spain, like elsewhere in Europe, has steadily fallen.\nThe majority of Spaniards - 59.3 per cent - say they 'almost never' attend Mass, according to a survey published in December by the Sociological Research Centre (CIS). Just 15 per cent said they went every week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319716/Bid-ban-Sunday-Mass-public-TV-Spain-backfires.html"}
