He won an astonishing rally at 30-15 as Djokovic looked to have won the point twice before Federer produced a stunning backhand pass.\nDjokovic, however, regained his composure to flick a backhand pass of his own, before drilling a return at Federer's feet to clinch the break.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3420818/Novak-Djokovic-dominates-Roger-Federer-reach-Australian-Open-final.html"}
