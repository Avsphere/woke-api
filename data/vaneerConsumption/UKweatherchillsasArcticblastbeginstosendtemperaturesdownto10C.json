Flurries of snow could even fall on London and the South, although they are unlikely to settle.\nMet Office forecaster Jenna MacGregor said: 'It's going to be much colder than we've been used to.\n'The chilly weather will come as a bit of a shock as we've had it so mild up to now, particularly compared to December's weather when we had 10C (50F).\n'Temperatures will start to get cold on Tuesday night. Snow will fall and settle on higher ground in the North. There may be some snow in the South but it probably will not settle.'\nFrom today there will be blustery showers across the country, turning to hail in the South at times, she said. The chill will mostly be felt at night, while daytime temperatures will drop to as low as 5 or 6C (41-43F).\n'Overnight from Tuesday into Wednesday, that's when we'll see –10C in the Scottish Highlands,' she added.\n'Elsewhere it will be close to zero at night, around zero in places such as Norwich and Birmingham.' The freezing temperatures will leave icy patches on ungritted roads so motorists will be advised to take extra care.\nWhite: A snow-covered Nenthead in Cumbria yesterday as forecasters warned some parts of the UK could see a further two inches of snow\nPretty: Snow-covered homes in Overwater, Cumbria, are seen yesterday as forecasters predict temperatures could drop to -10C this week\nDriving in Cumbria: Forecasters are predicting at least a week of severe winter weather across much of the UK\nMaking a way through: A plough is seen clearing snow in Northumberland on the road between Allendale and Nenthead yesterday\nTaking care: Lowson Robinson clears snow from his miniature clock tower model built in his garden in Cumbria yesterday morning\nBut while it will be cold, there will be occasional sunny spells during the week.\nAt the weekend the lowest temperature was at Braemar in the Highlands, where it plunged to –7.7C (18F). In the South, however, there were warm spring-like temperatures in some places, reaching as high as 12C (54F) in Swanage, Dorset, on Saturday.\nLast night the Met Office issued severe weather warnings for rain along much of England's south coast and the South-East, where heavy showers, hail and thunder were forecast. Up to 1.2 inches may have fallen by this morning, forecasters said.\nMel Harrowsmith, head of civil contingencies at the Met Office, said last night: 'For many the weather during the coming week is likely to be the first experience of winter, with either frost, wintry showers or even snow affecting many areas of the UK.'\nAs a result of the continued unsettled conditions, flooding is expected in northern areas that have already been battered by storms Desmond, Eva and Frank over the past five weeks.\nYesterday, many parts of the Scottish Borders and Northumberland woke up to a sheet of white snow, which is likely to stay for at least a few days.\nIn North Yorkshire, a one-year-old girl had a lucky escape after being rescued from a van stuck in 3ft of floodwater near Malton at noon.\nFirefighters were called to the vehicle in which two adults and the baby had become trapped in water, but they were rescued and no one was injured.\nSnow hits the central belt: Difficult driving conditions in the rural village of Harthill, off the M8 in North Lanarkshire, Scotland\nDangerous conditions: A Ford car leaves a trail in the snow as the driver makes their way through Harthill in North Lanarkshire yesterday\nTop of the hill: Dylan the Welsh Springer Spaniel in Holme Moss in the South Pennines, on the border of Derbyshire and West Yorkshire\nWater alert: Heavy rain has breached the banks of the River Wey in the commuter belt town of Guildford in Surrey\nRiver Wey: Flooding is also expected in northern areas that have already been battered by storms Desmond, Eva and Frank in recent weeks\nIn Aberdeenshire, areas are slowly recovering from flooding that saw dozens of homes evacuated last week.\nAnd wet weather and freezing temperatures are now bringing the hazard of ice on the roads for many parts.\nDozens of homes were evacuated in Inverurie, Port Elphinstone and Ellon as the swollen River Don sent flood waters racing down the streets.\nWater also poured from the River Ythan, prompting the emergency services to mount an operation to rescue residents.\nThe Donside area, Keith, Huntly, Turriff, Kintore and parts of Aberdeen were also affected by the flooding.\nParts of Britain on alert: The Met Office has put out weather warnings for rain today (left) with flood alerts still in place across the UK (right)\nChilly: It was a cold but bright day in the Derbyshire Peak District yesterday as the unseasonably mild weather comes to an end\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said it expects river levels to fall gradually.\nBut it warned of 'residual impacts' in areas such as Kintore and Inverurie, where two severe flood warnings are currently in place.\nThe South East of England also saw localised flooding, as Port Meadow in Wolvercote, near Oxford had an overflow of the River Thames.\nBritain experienced a mild December, with temperatures at 15C on Christmas Day in the South West, despite one of the wettest months on record.\nMINI TORNADO IN SWANSEA CAR PARK LEAVES TESCO VAN ON ITS SIDE Shoppers have told of their shock after a mini tornado appeared to rip through a car park, pushing a large van onto its side.

'I didn't believe him at first, but I went to have a look and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I've never seen anything like it.' Fire crews had to move the van from its side before taking it away from the scene. No one was reported to have been injured.\nBridge which collapsed following severe flooding will receive £3.3million of Government money\nA 300-year-old bridge which collapsed after being battered by flooding is set to receive £3.3million in Government funding to reunite a community.\nThe 18th century bridge over the River Wharfe in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, was ravaged by rising flood waters - which split the village in two.\nThe Department for Transport will also fund a temporary £300,000 footbridge at the site - as people are currently using a bus service to get across.\nDestroyed: The damaged bridge over the River Wharfe in Tadcaster which was viewed by the Duke of York during his visit to the area\nIt is believed that it could take up to 12 months for the works to be completed.\nThe government's Flood Envoy, Scarborough & Whitby MP Robert Goodwill, said fixing the historic bridge was 'a national priority'.\nApproving cash for the repairs, Mr Goodwill said: 'The floods in Yorkshire have been devastating for residents and businesses across the county.\n'And we have seen the partial collapse of the Tadcaster bridge split the community in two.\nSplit in two: The 18th century bridge over the River Wharfe in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, was ravaged by rising flood waters\n'We have made the repair of the bridge a national priority and I am pleased to announce that we are providing £3.3million to restore this important route.\n'I am determined to ensure I do everything I can to help and this is an important step in keeping the recovery effort on track in Yorkshire.'\nThis funding is understood to be in addition to £10million pledged by the Government to improve flood defences in York and North Yorkshire.\nCouncillor Carl Les, leader of North Yorkshire County Council, said: 'We want to get life in Tadcaster back to normal as quickly as possible.'\nCash: The extra funding is said to be in addition to £10million pledged by the Government to improve flood defences in North Yorkshire\nA DfT spokesman said work had already taken place on the west side of the bridge to remove debris from the river.\nHe said work was also underway to improve the surface of the pedestrian crossing of the Wharfe over the viaduct.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393226/The-big-chill-Arctic-blast-begins-set-send-temperatures-plunging-10C-hail-sleet-blow-north.html"}
