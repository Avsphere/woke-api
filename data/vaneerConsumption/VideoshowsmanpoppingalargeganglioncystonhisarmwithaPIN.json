In the film he cries out in pain as the pin enters his arm\nMailOnline has already reported on Jason's previous attempts to drain the cyst - by hammering a needle into it with a screwdriver. Doctors say Jason's methods are 'dangerous' and shouldn't be tried at home\nIn the new clip, uploaded to his YouTube channel The Wrist Cyst, Jason describes his new method.\nHe said: ‘It’s really big, it hurts. In the past I’ve done things to pop it by hammering a needle into it, which worked really well\n‘I tried drilling it with a drill gun, and that did not work very well, I just twisted my skin up.\nHe continued: ‘This time I’ve come up with a really good idea to take a pushpin and hammer the cyst.\n‘I think it’s a genius idea, as there’s only so far the pushpin can go, so it’s going to go into my cyst and stop at its natural stopping point.\n‘Hopefully this will be the perfect way to drain my ganglion cyst.’\nHOW NOT TO TREAT A GANGLION Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, condemned Jason's method of popping his cyst. He told MailOnline: ' We advise not draining minor ganglions. 'They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion in this way on so many levels. Traditionally, ganglions would be 'bashed with the family bible', but doctors do not advise this 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. 'If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating. 'There used to be a myth that you should bash a ganglion with a family bible to burst it. 'That’s caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint, causing carpel tunnel syndrome: swelling inside the wrist. 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as \"aseptic\", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care .'\nAs his wife, who is filming the endeavour zooms in, he takes a small black pin and puts it at the peak of the lump.\nHe later explained he had sanitized the pin earlier.\n‘It’s really hard to do this,’ he says, trying to keep it in position.\nThen, he begins tapping the pin into his arm.\n‘Ow. Shoot. Gosh,’ he exclaims loudly, clearly in a lot of pain.\n‘I’m not sure if it’s in my cyst or in the skin around it,’ he adds, moving the pin around.\nThen, he says he is going to pull the pin out in order to drain the cyst.\n‘We’re going to see cyst glory,’ he says.\nAs he pulls it out, reams of viscous clear jelly pour out of his arm and he rubs his fingers together to show how sticky it is.\n‘Oh my goodness, that is the motherload of cyst juice,’ he says.\n‘My wrist can move again.’\nUnsurprisingly, medical professionals do not advise using Jason's method to treat lumps found on the body.\nAfter Jason’s previous video, Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, explained his cyst is a ganglion, a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon.\nGanglions are made up of a thick jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement.\nThey occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin.\nGanglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most commonly found on the wrist, hand and fingers.\nGenerally harmless, if they do not cause any pain, they can be left alone and will disappear without any treatment.\nDr Ghosh said: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand.\n'A ganglion is a fluid-filled sack. If you start the drainage process, the bigger and bigger the sack will fill.\n'This is the issue this gentleman has caused, he’ll need to drain it more often.'\nHe told MailOnline it is dangerous for patients to try and drain growths at home.\n'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert anything that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria.\n'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating.'\nTraditionally, ganglions were treated by being 'bashed with the family Bible', but this is no longer recommended, as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added.\nHe told MailOnline: 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating.'\nAs Jason pulls out the pin reams of sticky, clear jelly oozes out (left). He rubs his fingers together to show how thick it is (right). ‘Oh my goodness, that is the motherload of cyst juice,’ Jason said\nIf the cyst needs treatment, the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor, or cut out in a surgical procedure.\nDr Ghosh added: 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus.\n'But that would be what is known as \"aseptic\", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection.\n'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand.\n'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3393848/Horrifying-video-shows-man-popping-large-cyst-arm-PIN.html"}
