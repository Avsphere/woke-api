It always has from the very beginning.”\nHe continued, “We can argue about whether that’s a good or bad thing but it’s been true for 240 years. And I think it is going to go forward. The president introduced — and even if he hasn’t introduced it, exacerbated to a remarkable degree — a culture of bullying, name-calling, and hectoring. And you reap what you sow. The folks who work for him, who are part of this remarkably unconventional administration — and that’s putting it as politely as I can on a Monday — I don’t think should be surprised at this reaction.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/06/25/meacham-trump-staff-should-expect-public-shaming-you-reap-what-you-sow/"}
