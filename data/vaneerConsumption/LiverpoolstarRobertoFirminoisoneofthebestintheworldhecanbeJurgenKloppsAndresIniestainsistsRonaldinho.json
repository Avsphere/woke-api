He's in the same class as Ozil, [David] Silva, Iniesta, and all the other great players who play that role.'\n'He's the player that I'm sure Klopp will build his new Liverpool team around.\n'Klopp is one of the best coaches in the world, he will know that Liverpool need better players, he will know that Firmino will need better players around him to get the most out of his game.'\nLiverpool signed Firmino from Hoffenheim on a five-year deal for a fee of Â£29million during the summer, but the Brazilian struggled to make an impact during his first few months in England.\nIt was 14 games before the 24-year-old scored his first Reds goal, finding the net during his side's 4-1 demolition of Manchester City last November.\nMore recently, Firmino helped Liverpool secure a dramatic 5-4 win over Norwich with the Brazilian bagging a brace at Carrow Road before Adam Lallana's late winner.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3422289/Liverpool-star-Roberto-Firmino-one-best-world-Jurgen-Klopp-s-Andres-Iniesta-insists-Ronaldinho.html"}
