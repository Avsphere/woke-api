But the short-run effect would surely be bad,\" she told clients.\nRedwood did not go into specific detail in terms of forecasts, but said that a no deal Brexit could \"plausibly knock a percentage point or so off growth next year.\"\nOne of the reasons for that, Redwood argued, is that no deal would inevitably have a major negative impact on the price of the pound.\n\"On the plus side, this would cushion the impact on exporters,\" she wrote. \"But it would also push up inflation, renewing the squeeze on consumers' real incomes seen after the pound fell following the EU referendum in June 2016.\"\nReal wages for UK workers dropped significantly in the 18 months after the referendum as inflation rose to 3% but wage growth remained around 2%. Britain is a consumer focused economy, so when regular workers are earning less, and therefore not spending on non-necessity items, the economy at large suffering.\nSuch an issue could be compounded, Redwood said, by the UK \"imposing import tariffs on the EU, raising import prices.\"\nFurthermore, business leaders have largely argued for the softest Brexit possible, so no deal would likely represent a major dent to business confidence overall.\n\"Admittedly, the nosedive in sentiment and GDP growth that was widely expected after referendum never happened,\" Redwood said. The chart below shows that expected nosedive.\nCapital Economics\n\"But that was partly because of hopes that the UK would reach an agreement to replicate the current free trade arrangements.\"\nRedwood is, however, much less pessimistic than some forecasters, saying that it is unlikely a no deal Brexit will \"plunge the UK into recession.\"\nOne reason for that, she said, is that Britain wouldn't need to pay anything to Brussels on exiting.\n\"Remember that leaving without a deal would mean that the UK wouldn't have to pay its (front-loaded) Brexit 'divorce bill' of Â£40bn odd, equivalent to around 2% of GDP. This money could be used to offset the adverse effects on the economy.\"\nRedwood also sees Britain falling back on WTO rules for trade as \"not the end of the world.\"\n\"As far as trade is concerned, reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would not be the end of the world. While the UK would face the EU's Common External Tariff on its exports to the EU, tariff rates are on average low at 4%,\" she concluded.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/no-deal-brexit-impact-uk-economy-2018-7"}
