I went over to my my dad and he said it might be a tick,' Miss Jackson told ABC's 7:30.\n'When I lose my vision, it feels like I'm in a dark room with no doors, no windows, and it's night-time and you just can't see anything.'\nThe eight-year-old, who contracted the disease when she was just five, said she loves swimming because she can hop in the pool, 'even if my feet are sore' - a symptom of her illness.\nGenavieve's mother, Marie Huttley-Jackson, also told the program about the difficult process it took to receive an initial diagnosis.\nGenavieve's mother, Marie Huttley-Jackson (left), opened up about the difficult process it took to receive an initial diagnosis\n'We had 23 different doctors and 20 months of searching before we found out what was wrong,' Ms Huttley-Jackson told 7:30.\n'We got to the point we'd seen so many doctors, we called the doctors we didn't like by the number in the sequence of doctors that we'd seen. Because we didn't think they deserved a name.'\nLyme disease is an infection caused by tick bites, and the bacteria it can release into victims.\n'We had 23 different doctors and 20 months of searching before we found out what was wrong,' Ms Huttley-Jackson told ABC's 7:30\nAccording to the Lyme Disease Association of Australia, the illness can: 'impact many bodily systems and organs and can in some cases mimic other illnesses... as well as giving people Lyme Disease, the ticks often also transmit other diseases.'\nIt also lists a number of symptoms online, including: intense pressure inside the head, white matter lesions on the brain, double vision and blurry vision, shortness of breath, body tremors and shakes, seizures, motion sickness, memory loss and a difficulty to speak.\nHowever, despite the concerning list of potential problems linked with the illness, experts say just 20 people in Australia are treating patients with Lyme disease - a number which is dropping after actions from the health industry.\n'There are now seven GPs in Australia who've had restrictions placed on them by APRA, which is the national medical board,' Lyme disease treating GP Peter Dobie told the ABC.\nLyme disease treating GP Peter Dobie is one of reportedly 20 doctors in Australia who helps patients with the illness\nLyme disease is an infection caused by tick bites, and the bacteria it can release into victims\n'They've been told by APRA that they are no longer allowed to diagnose or treat Lyme disease.\n'There's only about 20 doctors in the country treating this illness.'\nDespite the seeming set-back, Dr Dobie said he is confident of tackling the disease because of: 'increasing community awareness about the illness and certainly increasing awareness in the media and increasing awareness by politicians'.\nIt comes after a young woman who contracted the disease detailed her journey to Germany late last year to receive more comprehensive help than what is offered in Australia.\nTahlia Smith, 21, who contracted the disease detailed her journey to Germany late last year to receive more comprehensive help than what is offered in Australia\nMs Smith detailed her experience getting the controversial treatment using a Facebook page she had created\nTahlia Smith, 21, from the New South Wales Hunter Region was getting controversial treatment to tackle her diagnosis.\nTahlia's father, Brett, provided updates following the gruesome discovery showing 'live active Spirochetes... wiggling around everywhere' in his daughter's blood.\n'I have never seen anything like it ... this was done four hours after that blood was taken and they were still active,' he wrote on a Facebook page - Tahlia's Lymes journey to Germany.\nTahlia's father, Brett, said when they looked at her blood under a microscope they saw 'live active Spirochetes which is the Lyme Disease itself wiggling around everywhere'\nTahlia underwent blood filtration and her mother Lea said treatment also involved heating Tahlia's body up to 42 degrees to kill the borrelia bacterium in her blood\nThe treatment of Lyme disease is a contentious topic in Australian health, as it is currently not recognised by the federal Department of Health.\nPeople who have symptoms of the illness in Australia have lacked the recognised Lyme disease causing bacteria, and as a result, no clinical diagnosis exists for it in Australia.\nThe Department of Health website on the illness reads: 'Even though the Chief Medical Officerâ€™s Clinical Advisory Committee on Lyme Disease (CACLD) has ceased, the Australian Government Department of Health will maintain an interest in an Australian Lyme disease-like syndrome.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393667/Little-girl-8-forced-visit-23-doctors-diagnosed-Lyme-disease-bitten-tick-beach-s-not-recognised-Australia.html"}
