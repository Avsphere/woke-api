The edges of the piece of metal appear to reveal a 'honeycomb' structure, which is widely used in aircraft and rockets due to its light weight\nOfficial: Thai soldiers carry a piece of suspected aircraft debris after it was found by fishermen on January 23, at a beach in the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat\nSpeculation: Villagers discovered the piece of metal (pictured), before reporting it to the authorities to help identify it, said Tanyapat Patthikongpan, head of Pak Phanang district\nMeasuring about eight feet in length, it has led to villagers speculating that it could have come from an aircraft.\nAfter examining the metal piece, the team of investigators then travelled to the beach where it was first discovered just 50 yards from the shore.\n'We would urge the public not to make any speculation about its origins,' said a police spokesman.\nThe Malaysian team have yet to make any comment on their findings.\nDespite excitement being raised about the discoveries off the coastlines facing the Gulf of Thailand, the official search for MH370 continues in the southern Indian Ocean, south west of Australia.\nLast July a two-metre-long wing part known as a flaperon washed up on a beach on the French-held Indian Ocean island of Reunion, thousands of kilometres from Thailand.\nFrench authorities subsequently confirmed 'with certainty' two months later than the wing part found on the remote island was from MH370.\nMissing: A map showing the fated plane's flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing; where the last radar contact was received from the plane; the wreckage discovered this week in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand; and the wreckage discovered on La Reunion island in July 2015, which was confirmed to be from the MH370\nGenuine: French prosecutors confirmed 'with certainty' in September that the wing part (above) found on a remote Indian Ocean island, La Reunion, in July was from missing flight MH370\nTests were carried out on the flaperon, which was found on La Reunion in July, by the French body responsible for civil aviation accident investigations.\nAt the time of the discovery on the French territory last month, Malaysian officials said it was 'almost certain' the wing flap came from a Boeing 777 â€“ the same model as the Malaysian airlines jet.\nThe 6ft-long wing flap washed up 3,500 miles from the doomed jet's last-known location, fuelling hopes across the world that one of aviation's greatest mysteries could finally be solved.\nThe search for the plane is due to end in June this year, despite the Chinese relatives pleading for it to be expanded.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422628/Second-piece-metal-debris-believed-missing-MH370-washes-time-near-Malaysian-village-low-flying-jet-seen-day-vanished.html"}
