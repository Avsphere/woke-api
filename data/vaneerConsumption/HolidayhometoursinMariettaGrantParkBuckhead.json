Along with festive finery, the events benefit a number of community organizations while making our bustling metro feel like home for the holidays.\n“It’s really a community event,” said Johnny Sinclair, co-chair of the 30th annual Marietta Pilgrimage Christmas Home Tour. “One of the reasons I love the Pilgrimage is because it’s Marietta coming together. People get involved.”\nThe event is jointly organized by the Marietta Visitors Bureau and Cobb Landmarks & Historical Society, with scores of volunteers pitching in as docents, and proceeds benefit restoration and educational efforts. This year’s tour features six homes in the Kennesaw Avenue historic district. Kennesaw Avenue, once known as Cassville Road, was rechristened in 1882 and coined “The Peachtree Street of Marietta” by The Marietta Journal a few years later, according to the event’s history notes.\nEvent co-chair Sarah Bullington, at the helm for the third time, has played a key role in at least a dozen Pilgrimages. Her home has been on tour in the past, and she enjoys the chance to view other historic homes each year.\n“They’re not building any more old houses,” she noted.\nHere are details for this and other area home tours.\nMarietta Pilgrimage Christmas Home Tour. 9 a.m.-6 p.m. (day tour) and 7-9:30 p.m. (candlelight tour) Saturday and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday.

Established in the late 1890s, Grant Park is Atlanta’s largest historic district with homes built in the Victorian, Craftsman, Italianate and other styles from the turn of the century, and the homes on tour reflect the area’s diverse architectural styles.
