Instead, he ends up in a suitcase dumped in a field in Arkansas.'\nPolice said Brooks, who was just 4ft 11in tall, wasn't dismembered.\nGilbo said authorities will not be extraditing the suspects to New York because of Arkansas' strict laws on abuse of a corpse.\nIn New York, the offense is punishable by three years in prison, while in Arkansas it is punishable by 10 years.\nBrooks served in the military and was a gunner in a B-17 bomber's ball turret.\n'It's the most dangerous assignment in war,' Prairie County Sheriff Rick Hickman said. 'The belly gunner is in a small bubble on the bottom of the plane. The enemy wants to shoot at him first. Life expectancy on that job is very short.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4320588/89-year-old-man-suitcase-identified-WWII-veteran.html"}
