Ahmadinejad said his achievement in making Holocaust denial no longer taboo was the highlight of his presidency.\nMost recently, Iran held a cartoon contest in May which the U.S. termed “a platform for Holocaust denial and revisionism and egregiously anti-Semitic speech.”\nZarif denied that the contest had anything to do with the Iranian government.\nBahari warned against believing Zarif, calling it a “lie.”\n“Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism has become a weapon of the hardliners in Iran to use against reformers,” he said. “So whenever the hardliners want to put pressure on reformers they promote anti-Semitism and deny the Holocaust because they know exactly what it will mean from outside of Tehran.”\nStahnke said Rouhani will likely use the UN platform to decry extremism while condemning its rival, Saudi Arabia.\n“Iranian leaders should be made to talk about Iranian Holocaust denial at the UN General Assembly,” Bahari said.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/09/22/holocaust-museum-calls-for-pressure-on-rouhani-to-confront-holocaust-denial-at-un/"}
