Does he make the ground shake?\nSeattle Seahawks fans set a decibel record, since broken by the Arrowhead Stadium faithful, last season. Tonight, scientists record whether 67,000 Seahawks backers can register a rumble on the Richter scale.\nThe New York Times reports that the white coats at the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network placed sensors in three spots around CenturyLink Field to detect the earth’s movement in response to the movement of the Earthlings. A seismic sensor’s detection of unexplained movement near the field more than three years ago, which the scientists ultimately traced back to a 67-yard run by Marshawn Lynch–the man’s strides alone surely register on the Richter scale–inspired Saturday’s fusion of sports and science.\nThe geophysicists created a website that will track the seismic happenings at CenturyLink Field in real time during the game. So, for the scientifically-inclined sports fan, keep your browser fixed on pnsn.org/seahawks/quickshake as you tune the television to Fox.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2015/01/10/scientists-seismic-sensors-gauge-if-marshawn-lynch-makes-earth-shake/"}
