The Little Sisters have now asked the U.S. Supreme Court to protect them from the mandate.\nThe Obama administration claims that, through an “accommodation,” it has offered to reimburse the costs of the services it requires the Little Sisters to provide–so they should have no moral objection to complying with the mandate. The Little Sisters, however, say their legal challenge is not about money, but conscience and the freedom not to offer services in their healthcare plan that conflict with their beliefs. They also say they should not have to comply with the HHS mandate when those services could be provided more effectively through the government’s healthcare exchanges.\nThe Becket Fund states that the Obama administration’s arguments to the Supreme Court admits that women not covered by the mandate can still obtain free birth control through a family member’s health plan or through the Obamacare exchanges. But it also simultaneously argues that exempting the Little Sisters would compromise the government’s goal of offering universal free access to birth control and abortion-inducing drugs.\nThe Becket Fund states:\nUsing the healthcare exchanges, which the government has hailed as an ‘easy and fast’ healthcare option for millions of Americans, would protect both the Little Sisters of the Poor’s religious freedom and the government’s goal to provide free access to these services to women who want them.\nMore than 40 friend-of-the-court briefs have been filed at the Supreme Court on behalf of the Little Sisters. The high court will hear their case on March 23.\nLast September, in a highly unusual move, five federal judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit issued an opinion criticizing their court panel’s refusal to change its decision to force the Little Sisters into providing free birth control to employees.\n“The opinion of the panel majority is clearly and gravely wrong–on an issue that has little to do with contraception and a great deal to do with religious liberty,” the opinion reads. “When a law demands that a person do something the person considers sinful, and the penalty for refusal is a large financial penalty, then the law imposes a substantial burden on that person’s free exercise of religion.”\nThe judges added, “[I]t is not the job of the judiciary to tell people what their religious beliefs are.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/03/05/obama-administration-exempts-100-million-from-hhs-contraception-mandate-but-not-little-sisters-of-the-poor/"}
