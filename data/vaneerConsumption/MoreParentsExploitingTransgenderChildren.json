There are currently over 3 million views. That’s more than 3 million people who’ve seen these young children being “affirmed” by their parents for being transgender…at this moment.\nWhy would parents do this to their children? Children change their minds. Adults change their minds.\nMore than that, these children have lost anonymity because their parents are so hellbent to prove a political point. This is Munchausen Syndrome by proxy and abusive.\nHere is an adult talking about his experience transitioning and then living with the regret:\nRecently I received an email that blows the lid off the idea of sex change success and illustrates the truth about damaged lives. This man’s story of transition started in his teens. He explains: I transitioned to female beginning in my late teens and changed my name in my early 20s, over ten years ago. But it wasn’t right for me; I feel only discontent now in the female role. I was told that my transgender feelings were permanent, immutable, physically deep-seated in my brain and could NEVER change, and that the only way I would ever find peace was to become female. The problem is, I don’t have those feelings anymore. When I began seeing a psychologist a few years ago to help overcome some childhood trauma issues, my depression and anxiety began to wane but so did my transgender feelings. So two years ago I began contemplating going back to my birth gender, and it feels right to do so. I have no doubts–I want to be male! I did have orchiectomy [the removal of one or both testicles], and that happened before my male puberty had completed, so I have a bit of facial hair which I never bothered to get electrolysis or laser for, and so the one blessing about all this is that with male hormone treatment I can still resume my male puberty where it was interrupted and grow a full beard and deep voice like I would have had if transgender feelings hadn’t intruded upon my childhood. My breasts are difficult to hide though, so I’ll need surgery to get rid of them. And saddest of all, I can never have children, which I pray God will give me the strength to withstand that sadness. When this man’s childhood trauma was treated appropriately, his transgender feelings waned. But sadly, he lost ten years of his life and the ability to father biological children.\nThis adult is writing now and he has been spared the pain of having his private life made public by his parents or others. Not so, these children.\nShame on the parents and shame on a culture encouraging this abuse. These children are being victimized twice over and by those who should protect them.","url":"https://spectator.org/more-parents-exploiting-transgender-children/"}
