The association seeks “to gain more insight into the outer and inner conditions that made possible the 40 years of a second German dictatorship in the 20th century.”\nThe researchers who led the study, Monika Deutz-Schroeder and Klaus Schroeder, said anti-Semitic extremist leftism equates “Jew” with “capitalist” and “exploiter.”\nThe study also noted that according to police statistics since 2009, leftwing violence has been more prevalent in Germany than rightwing violence.\nThe survey was financed by the Federal Ministry of Family, Senior Citizens, Women, and Youth.\nWhile the researchers do not believe left-wing violence poses a threat to Germany’s democracy, they warned of an increase in violence among leftists.\nCalls to boycott Israel are widespread among German leftwing extremists. The annual international worker’s day event in Berlin has hosted Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) groups.\nThe city of Bremen in northern Germany is known to be a hotbed of BDS activity. The city came under fire for giving municipality-funded premises for campaigns against the Jewish state.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/07/19/german-leftwing-radicals-money-grabbing-jews-have-too-much-influence/"}
