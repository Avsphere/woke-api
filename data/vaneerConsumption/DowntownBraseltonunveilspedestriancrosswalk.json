Construction crews completed the 75-foot thermoplastic installation last week. It is sided with reflective strips for pedestrian safety. Braselton is told it is the longest installation the company has ever completed.\nThe project became a reality with a grant of $5000 from the Georgia Council for the Arts and its Vibrant Communities Grant program funded by the Georgia General Assembly. Local donors, including businesses, foundations and individuals, ensured the success of the project by providing the remaining necessary funds.\n“It’s another Braselton success story,” added Councilman Hardy Johnson.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/downtown-braselton-unveils-pedestrian-crosswalk/KEbdcP0vw09tmgdgAidk8J/"}
