Recording primarily with an avant-garde jazz quartet and with a longtime collaborator, co-producer Tony Visconti, Bowie crafted a haunting, seven-song collection that deals thematically with death and despair — and now will be endlessly parsed for clues about his own impending mortality.\nFar from being depressing, the album feels uplifting and relentlessly inventive. Credit, of course, goes to Bowie, but his new playmates here keep pace with him note for note, especially drummer Mark Guiliana, whose persistent beats provide an earthly tether to Bowie's often ethereal vocals, and saxophonist Donny McCaslin, whose bleating playing often gives the project a deliberately off-kilter, discordant feel.\nFILE - In this Sept. 14, 1995, file photo, David Bowie performs in Hartford, Conn.
