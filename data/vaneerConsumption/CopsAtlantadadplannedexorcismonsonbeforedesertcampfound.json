A woman at the door politely said the family wasn’t ready to talk. The Clayton County child remains missing even after authorities found his father Friday in a filthy compound in the northern New Mexico desert, along with 11 kids and three adults.\nSiraj Ibn Wahhaj had been wanted since December, when the child’s mother told Clayton police he took the boy and traveled west. A warrant obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said they left after the dad mentioned intentions to perform an “exorcism” on his son because Abdul-Ghani was “possessed by the Devil.”\nThe boy had struggled his whole life with neurological problems from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. He can’t walk and suffers from seizures, the warrant said.\nAuthorities in Taos County, New Mexico said none of the adults found in encampment would say where Abdul-Ghani is.\nREAD: Relief after DeKalb dad gets maximum time for drowning autistic son\nREAD: Was it fear — or recklessness — that took down Jason Spencer?\nREAD: Good things coming for notorious, crime-infested DeKalb complex?\nThe idea that the missing Georgia boy might be at the compound started with a plea for help apparently sent from someone inside to a Clayton County detective: “We are starving and need food and water.”\nTaos County, New Mexico authorities described the group as possible “Muslim extremists,” though further information hasn’t been released on those suspicions. Abdul-Ghani’s father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, does come from a Muslim family.\nHis father, Siraj Wahhaj, is a well-known imam, who speaks at mosques across the country, including the Doraville and New York City locations of Masjid At-Taqwa. The imam couldn’t be reached for comment immediately Monday.\nThe small compound in New Mexico is composed of an old partially buried RV, a wall of tires and an earthen berm. It sits south of the Colorado border amid the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.\nTaos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe, whose investigators think the missing boy has been at the camp in recent weeks, said the property had no clean water, almost no food, no hygienic products. The kids wore dirty rags and no shoes.\nThe kids found there are in custody of the state of New Mexico, and the adults are in jail.\nOn Sunday, the Taos County sheriff announced 11 charges of child cruelty against all five adults: Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, Lucas Allen Morton, Jany Leveille, Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj.\nAn aerial view of the compound in Amalia, New Mexico where authorities arrested two Metro Atlanta men on Friday in a child abduction case. One of the men, Siraj Wahhaj, is accused of abducting his three-year-old son from Clayton county in December. His son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, was not found at the compound Friday, but investigators believe he had been there in the past few weeks. Source: Taos County Sheriff’s Office\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what relationship there was between the suspects. The sheriff’s office said the women are believe to be mothers of the children found.\nAbdul-Ghani’s mother wasn’t there. She’s been in Georgia trying to figure out what happened to her son after he went with his father to a park and never returned.\nSince then, she and other family have plastered their Facebook pages with missing persons flyers, asking for anyone with information to call Clayton police. They also put flyers out in public.\nThe last known sighting of the child and father together was Dec. 13 in Chilton County, Alabama, when they were involved in a single-vehicle accident.\nPolice said there were five other children and two additional adults in the vehicle. Wahhaj told an officer they were headed to New Mexico for a camping trip.\nSomeone in a truck, which was registered to Morton, picked them up after the wreck and they drove west.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cops-atlanta-dad-planned-exorcism-son-before-desert-camp-found/rPYsRjPw9IE7yqCB654XrL/"}
