It’s not just about being healthy; it’s also about loving who you are.”\nA social media campaign is also on the horizon for Graham and the swimwear brand, and will be tagged, “#CurvesinBikinis.”\n“Tastes and body types change over time and curves have been more ‘in.’ There is no better way to celebrate and show off than by donning a bikini,” said Moshe Laniado, President and CEO of swimsuitforall.\nThe magazine is set to hit store shelves on Feb. 9.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/02/04/sports-illustrated-to-feature-first-plus-size-model-in-2015-swimsuit-issue/"}
