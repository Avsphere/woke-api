This week, 1.3 million students, most aged between 18 and 21, head out on vacation, with a further 2.5 million set to follow on Friday\nOver the course of four days in Panama City Beach, DailyMail.com saw college girls 'performing' on stage for crowds of men who cheered them on and took videos of them with their phones\n'Disorderly conduct': One student appeared to expose herself to crowds of shocked onlookers\nThe student then seemed to dance her way off stage as men stared at her from behind dark sunglasses\nOf those, tens of thousands head to Panama City Beach, as well as other Florida resorts such as Daytona Beach and Fort Lauderdale, and Texas hotspot South Padre Island.\nFor Panama City Beach, the annual influx means a $40m payday – approximately $2m of which is funneled into city coffers via a statutory bed tax.\nBars and restaurants across town benefit greatly from the Spring Break shenanigans, including Dirty Dicks Crab House, whose slogan is 'where diners come to get crabs'.\nAcross the country, the student dollar equates to a $1bn boom for tour operators, bar owners and club promoters, according figures prepared by University of New Orleans economist John Laurie.\nBut not everyone is delighted to see the students, including the local police department which is charged with enforcing rules introduced in 2015 banning drinking on the beach following a spate of rapes – 42 between 2007 and 2014.\nOutside the Spinnaker Beach Club, which is famous for its Tuesday 'Beach Bash' parties, girls could be seen performing lewd dances for large crowds\nA group of college girls cheer on a friend as she funnels beer on her hotel balcony not far from the beach.

About 30 percent of American students will tap into their college debt to pay for their wild week-long holidays. While using student loan cash for booze, beer pong and sunblock is not illegal, few experts find it wise. 'Students should minimize their borrowing during their college years and live a sparse lifestyle — but no one wants to hear that when their fraternity brothers or sorority sisters are packing up to Cabo for the week,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst of Bankrate.com. 'It's like putting spring break on a credit card, but this one is subsidized by taxpayers,' McBride added. The average college student graduates with $28,000 in loans. The default rate on those loans is 11.8 percent, according to LendEDU. The company conducted a survey of 500 college students who have an outstanding student loan and who said that they were planning a spring-break getaway. The 30 percent response rate translates into 2.83 million students traveling to warmer climates on their loans.\nIn Daytona Beach, which hosts between 5,000 and 10,000 students each weekend in March, 106 arrests were made last weekend, while police in Fort Lauderdale - the fourth most popular destination of 2017 according to a survey of travel businesses - logged 137 crimes, albeit not all committed by Spring Breakers.\nAmong the those on the wrong side of the law in Panama City Beach was Adam, 20, a student from Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee, who was hauled off by cops for drinking on the beach according to his friends.\nGabriel, 21, and friends Mike and Brett, both 20, said their roommate had found himself being taken away by police after being caught drunk on the beach at noon.\n'It was crazy,' the trio told DailyMail.com. 'He was just having a few drinks on the beach and the cops showed up and took him away.'\nBut not everyone is delighted to see the students, including the local police department who arrested a number of party-goers for underage drinking, drinking on the beach, public intoxication and disorderly conduct\nIn the zone: One student appeared to really be into the music, raising one hand to the sky and holding a beer in the other\nParty on: Girls continued to dance on stage for the crowd and their cameras despite the risk of arrest\nA party-goer wearing a 'no shade' swimsuit seems to not have a care in the world as she dances for the crowd. 'We're getting drunk!' one Michigan student said\nGirls could be seen stripping off onstage and twerking for prizes ranging from t-shirts to having their entire bar tabs paid\nSome party-goers really outdid themselves, showing off their dance moves for the more-than-impressed onlookers\nMike, who was dressed in a Stars and Stripes bandana and matching swim shorts, added: 'They're going to fine him $250 and bring him back when he's sobered up.\n'It's crazy how harsh the cops are – we're just having fun but they're everywhere'.\nPaul Miller, 21, of the University of West Virginia, told DailyMail.com that he and his friends had come to party but complained of the police efforts to control the beach.\n'This [Panama City Beach] is the top Spring Break place and it's great for parties,' he said. 'But we should 100 per cent be able to have a beer and enjoy the beach without the cops stopping you.'\nThe first wave of Spring Break parties saw a spike in drinking offences, among them public intoxication and disorderly conduct.\nBy Monday afternoon, a further seven arrests had been made – most for breaking the beach booze ban and public intoxication.\nOne local cop, who asked not to be named, told DailyMail.com: 'We've arrested two already this morning. Each time, it has been for being intoxicated on the beach.\n'We take them to the Bay County Jail up the road and leave them there until they sober up.'\nLocal Police Chief Drew Whitman added: 'Most of the Spring Break arrests are for drinking on the sandy portion of the beach, underage drinking and disorderly conduct.\nAs the day went on, drunken revelers started to get sloppy. One student put herself in a very revealing position in front of her friend, who appeared to push her away\nHeartstopping moment: One acrobatic student jumped off a roof into the sandy beach as amazed spring breakers looked on\nDrunken delight: A college student sporting a light pink bikini seemed to be having the time of her life dancing at the bash\nShocking: The same student then flipped over, revealing herself to the crowd including a man whose jaw dropped at the sight\n'Those who are arrested can get fines of up to $500 and have to get a taxi back after we release them from jail. Or their friends can pick them up.'\nOther southern party towns such as Daytona Beach and Fort Lauderdale also saw arrests for drunkenness, underage drinking, loitering and fighting.\nDaytona Beach Police Chief Craig Capri said: 'Come here, have a good time and obey the law. But if you want to come here, get drunk and fight, you will be going to jail.'\nAnd in South Padre Island, Texas, local law enforcement said emergency calls are 'going up each day' with Police Chief Randy Smith predicting 'the busiest week of the year' when revelers from the hard-partying University of Texas descend on Friday.\nBut despite the risk of arrest, students in Panama City Beach told DailyMail.com they plan to party on regardless – and could be seen hauling bottles of booze into their rooms and playing a game of cat and mouse with cops determined to keep a lid on the shenanigans.\nUnhappy ending: Most appeared to be having a boozy good time, although it all proved too much for one reveler who was discovered by DailyMail.com drunkenly slumped over a table in Pizza Hut\nOutside the Spinnaker Beach Club, which is famous for its Tuesday 'Beach Bash' parties, students were seen passed out on the sand and falling over following rounds of 'Mega Loko' shots - a shot glass filled with vodka and Four Loko\nIn fact, revelers seemed to be passed out everywhere along on the beach as the day parties ended, falling over continuously\nSome spring breakers needed to be lifted off the ground by friends because of their drunken antics\nBut earlier in the day, students were seen looking more calm - lounging in the sun before the real partying began\nTwo spring breakers looked eager to party. One particularly patriotic party-goer sported a stars and stripes bandana\n'We're getting drunk!' one Michigan student named Michael told this website. 'We've got a load of vodka and lime pops in our room. We mix them together - you should try it.\n'We're just going to get drunk and have fun'.\nOutside the Spinnaker Beach Club, which is famous for its Tuesday 'Beach Bash' parties, students were seen passed out on the sand and falling over following rounds of 'Mega Loko' shots, made with an equal mix of vodka and Four Loko.\nMeanwhile, in neighboring Club La Vela, girls could be seen stripping off onstage and twerking lasciviously for prizes ranging from t-shirts to bar tabs in full view of the crowd.\nFurther down the beach, at the $142-a-night Holiday Inn, groups of students could be seen clustered on balconies challenging each other to drinking games.\nIn the evenings, youngsters intent on a good time headed to Club La Vela – a huge drinking spot that bills itself as 'the place to party with thousands'\nThe club is also famous for hosting wet t-shirt contests, as well as foam parties and live music; mostly hip hop stars including upcoming performer Ty Dolla $ign\nDetermined: One spring breaker is intent on keeping the party going, carrying milk and a six pack of beer back to his hotel\nStudents dancing at La Vela.

Dana added: 'Our plan for the week is to go to the beach every day and hit the clubs every night.'\nAccording to the local tourist board, last weekend's shenanigans were just the start of the Spring Break influx, with thousands more expected over the next two weeks.\nDaytona Beach, meanwhile, is expecting between 5,000 and 10,000 student vacationers next weekend alone, according to Chief Capri.\nA man walks down the beach with his friend in a festive costume, surely heading to one of the many Beach Bash parties\nFrat boys proudly show off their flag of Phi Delta Theta on the beach.

'Next week will be our busiest but calls are going up every day,' said Randy Smith.\nHe continued: 'We plan well ahead but you never know when criminal activity will occur. Most of the trouble is things like public intoxication, simple assaults and disorderly conduct [fighting].\n'We want everyone to have fun while in South Padre Island but safely.'\nChief Whitman, of Panama City Beach, added: 'Use good common sense and remember – if it's against the law where you come from, it probably is here too.'\nA message that many of the students in his town for Spring Break appear all too happy to ignore.\nAll smiles: Not everybody misbehaves on Spring Break - and police point out that the numbers of arrests are down, and that the alcohol ban is working on the beach\nToo rowdy: One party-goer needed to be steadily held so as not to fall backwards into the ocean - but still held onto his drink\nBut some spring breakers seemed to find time amid the crazy partying for a little beach romance\nThis year, tens of thousands of students head to Panama City Beach, as well as other Florida resorts such as Daytona Beach and Fort Lauderdale, and Texas hotspot South Padre Island for Spring Break","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4295400/Spring-Breakers-defy-drink-ban-twerk-flash-fight.html"}
