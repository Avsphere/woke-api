But you are not. You and your staff have never even asked us what we want.'\nAccording to prosecutors, Christopher set up cameras around the family's trailer home and would film the alleged sex attacks against his children.\nPolice said he also filmed lewd acts with his dog.\nSena encouraged his children to bring their friends over to the trailer so that he could abuse them, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported.\nOne woman who says she was sexually abused told investigators that she believes her high school friends were assaulted by Sena.\nNeighbors told the Review-Journal that he would seem 'excited' when his sons brought girlfriends over to the house.\nOthers described the Sena property as the place many neighborhood kids would hang out.
