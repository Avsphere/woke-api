Pete Wilson made a horrendous error in reconfiguring California’s electric power system, lawmakers are weighing another big change, this time integrating California’s grid with those of other Western states. Politicians should be very cautious of the new scheme.\nThe duplicitous campaigns against Democratic state Sen.
