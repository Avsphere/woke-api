They usually get DUI checkpoints correct & they use police scanners. Haven't passed by personally though. — jaime (@himay3000) February 3, 2017\nHowever, once Mr Checkpoint discovered those rumors were fake news, it posted on Facebook: “[]Looks like we have false reports of Immigration Checkpoints. Many people had messaged this and it looks like intentional misinformation that was meant to spread confusion & negativity.” It added, “Please move past this so we can shift back to positive energy.”\nTrying to figure out this whole immigration checkpoint thing going on in Ontario right now. I'm hoping we don't see more of these.. 😫 — Mr. Checkpoint™ (@MrCheckpoint) February 2, 2017\nWe received several reports of an immigration checkpoint that were found to not have occurred. Deleting that tweet and will keep you posted. — Mr. Checkpoint™ (@MrCheckpoint) February 3, 2017\nSome social media users reportedly stated that the brief detentions of some individuals in airports this past weekend, coupled with protests that wound up backing up traffic for hours, amplified concerns.\n“Rumors currently being circulated — primarily on social media, claiming the agency has set up checkpoints at multiple locations in Los Angeles — or that the agency is conducting random ‘raids’ are completely baseless,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice told the Times. “The agency is working diligently to address these false reports, and we urge the media not to give them credence. It only encourages ill-informed people to act irresponsibly.”\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2017/02/06/fake-news-reports-cause-panic-about-deportations/"}
