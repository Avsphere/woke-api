Jonathan Erns/Reuters\nShareholders have approved a $71 billion deal that merges some of 21st Century Fox's film and television assets with Disney.\nBoth companies announced Friday that their shareholders gave their approval in separate meetings in New York.\nDisney is purchasing the assets, which exclude the Fox News and Fox Business networks, for $38 a share. The merger could help Disney better compete with companies like Netflix, which acquire content and distribute it directly to consumers online. Disney is planning to launch a streaming service next year.\nDisney raised its offer after Comcast ignited a bidding war by putting in a $65 billion offer for the 21st Century Fox assets. Comcast ended its bid last week, saying it would instead focus on its fight with Fox to acquire the British broadcaster Sky.\n\"Combining the 21CF businesses with Disney and establishing new 'Fox' will unlock significant value for our shareholders,\" Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, said in a statement.\nThe Justice Department approved the deal on condition that the company sold the Fox Sports regional networks.\nDisney and 21st Century Fox shares were little changed after the shareholder approval on Friday.\nSee also:","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-21st-century-fox-deal-approved-2018-7"}
