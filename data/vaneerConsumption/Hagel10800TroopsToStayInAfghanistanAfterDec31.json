Instead, he said, the additional forces will remain because commitments from U.S. allies in Afghanistan had been slow to materialize in support of a NATO train-and-assist mission.","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/12/06/368933647/hagel-10-800-troops-to-stay-in-afghanistan-after-dec-31"}
