News 1130 reported a terrifying situation at the restaurant, with nearly a dozen dead plus multiple injuries, after “attackers apparently stormed the eateries, heavily armed with guns and grenades.” The New York Post writes of a man armed with a Kalashnikov rifle fatally shooting several people and wounding seven others at the restaurant. The NYP also mentions that the German soccer team playing in the stadium was evacuated from its hotel in western Paris this morning after a bomb threat, but returned safely later. The BBC’s report supports the account in the New York Post, adding a report of four deaths from a Parisian newspaper… but adds another report of shootings near the Bataclan arts center, plus the explosion at the bar near the stadium. A BBC journalist reported seeing at least ten people dead or seriously injured at the restaurant. The BBC says French President Francois Hollande was in attendance at the soccer game, but has been evacuated. Late reports have updated the death toll to at least 18. Meanwhile, another crisis was added at a fourth location: a hostage standoff at a theater.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/11/13/live-updates-fatalities-reported-shootout-explosions-paris-restaurant/"}
