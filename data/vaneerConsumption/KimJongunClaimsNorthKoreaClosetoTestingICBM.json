Their claims of producing a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside a missile are also regarded as dubious.\nIn March, the Pentagon confirmed North Korea’s development of a long-range missile that could potentially hit the continental United States. While the exact capabilities of this weapon system are in doubt, concerned analysts said it demonstrated how rapidly the North Koreans were evolving their missile designs, producing variants unique enough to acquire their own distinct system identifications.\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap news service notes that Pyongyang regards 2017 as an “opportune time” for nuclear weapons development, as it believes both the U.S. and South Korea would have an exceptionally difficult time interfering with its plans. Among the other “key anniversaries” and significant dates Kim might choose for a headline-grabbing ICBM test could be South Korea’s unexpectedly early presidential elections, following the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/02/north-korea-may-close-testing-icbm/"}
