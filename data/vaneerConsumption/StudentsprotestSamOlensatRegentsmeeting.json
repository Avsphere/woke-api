Many students and faculty oppose the plans. Their complaints include that there’s not been a national search for KSU president and positions he’s taken on issues some students feel are offensive to LGBT students.\nReturn to www.ajc.com and www.myajc.com for updates.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/students-protest-sam-olens-regents-meeting/IQGhPrCY4WjKsc8jaz2WqO/"}
