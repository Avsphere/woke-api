Barbara Lee (D-CA) tweeted on Wednesday.\nA huge victory for the resistance: Bannon’s sick ideology will no longer infect the National Security Council. https://t.co/vTnpbMoWpg — Barbara Lee (@BLeeForCongress) April 5, 2017\n“The removal of white supremacist and conspiracy theorist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council will make America safer,” a statement from MoveOn.org said.\n“MoveOn members and other Americans taking action via allied organizations generated 1.1 million signatures calling for Bannon’s removal from the NSC, and our voices were heard. Now it is time to fully remove him from his role in the White House,” the moveon.org statement said.\n“We hope that Stephen Bannon’s removal from the National Security Council will soon be followed by his ouster from the White House entirely,” a statement from the Southern Poverty Law Center said. “By his own admission, Bannon provided a platform, through Breitbart News, for a new breed of white supremacists.\n“He’s also been responsible for the bizarre appointment of former Breitbart writer Sebastian Gorka, someone with ties to anti-Semitic, far-right groups in Hungary, to a position in the White House,” the statement said. “The sooner that Bannon and people like Gorka leave Washington, the better.”\nRep. Robin Kelly (D-IL) tweeted she was happy she joined Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) in promoting legislation that would have forced Bannon to leave the NSC.\n“#SteveBannon removed from NSC! Proud to have joined @RepStephMurphy‘s effort to kick him off,” Kelly tweeted.\nRep. Adriano Espaillat (D-FL) said Bannon wants to overthrow the U.S. government.\n“#SteveBannon has made numerous inflammatory statements in support of overthrowing the United States Government,” Espaillat tweeted.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/04/05/left-revels-in-media-narrative-on-bannon-and-nsc-huge-victory-for-the-resistance/"}
