Her husband spent his first years living in a tree, and eating scraps from the local market.\nOver the years she became known as The Queen of St Kilda, and when she died in 1998, hundreds lined the streets as a horse-drawn carriage bearing her coffin paraded through the streets.\nTwins Rose Banks and Yvette Kelly, Carbone's daughters, began working at the hotel aged just 14 after their mother became too sick to handle the load by herself, and stayed there all their adult lives.\nSpeaking to documentary The Saints of St Kilda back in 2015, they described the job as 'tough', saying there were often days where they were thankful just to get to the end.\nCrimes committed at The Gatwick include rape, arson, murder, aggravated burglary and hundreds of drug offences, though the owners maintain this is largely the fault of people coming in from outside, rather than their residents\nThe property was owned by twin sisters Rose Baker and Yvette Kelly, whose Maltese-immigrant mother used to run it, though on Wednesday a caveat was put over the hotel by a company owned by Channel Nine\nVittoria Carbone, a mother-of-five, fled war in Malta to settle in Australia during a depression, living hand-to-mouth at first but eventually saving enough money to buy a string of properties, including The Gatwick\nRose and Yvette began working at the hotel at the age of 14 after their father pulled them out of school, and have remained there for the entirety of their adult lives\nWhile the property has always been run as a house for those at the bottom of society, the recent regeneration of St Kilda has caused it to come into conflict with the rest of the community\nLocal business owners have wanted the hotel bulldozed for years, eager to capitalise on the rising reputation of St Kilda\nStill, the sisters told filmmakers that they felt an immense pride in their work, and were personally offended by some of the harsher things written about the establishment.\nFeelings toward the boarding house in St Kilda were polarising. Local traders, eager to capitalise on the regeneration of the area, wanted it gone as quickly as possible.\nA Facebook group dedicated to the topic was littered with comments suggesting the only solution was to bulldoze the property, while others wanted to burn it to the ground.\nEven Rose and Yvette admitted that there was a problem with violence at the property. Officers shot one man dead there in 2011 after he stabbed a long-term resident in the back, while another man was stomped to death in the corridors in 2014.\nOther residents confessed to a major drugs problem, saying that virtually every illicit substance could either be bought there, or acquired by someone from outside.\nOne police officer told the Herald Sun that he personally dealt with four overdoses in 16 months.\nDespite that, senior officers praised the owners. Phil Hubbard, a detective senior-sergeant with St Kilda Police, described the sisters as 'very kind-hearted people who are helping' those living there.\nGovernment ministers also defended The Gatwick in the past, describing previous attempts to close the venue as 'cheap stunts', praising it as a place which 'ensures our most vulnerable get the support they need'.\nIndeed, following its closure, there is concern from social workers that evicting the 40 or so residents may contribute to a rise in Melbourne's already high homeless population.\nAs Rose pointed out in the documentary, evicting people from The Gatwick won't solve their problems, it will simply move them onto the streets, where it will likely be more difficult and time-consuming to deal with.\nDespite its reputation for drugs and crime, police and local politicians supported the hotel in the past, saying it helped the people living there and supported some of the most vulnerable\nIn recent years support has drained as violence has increased. Recent reports suggest police were attending the hotel five times a day, while leaked crime reports show 50 offences there in a six month period last year\nThe 41 residents of The Gatwick were told to consider packing their bags about a week ago, it is reported, before the caveat was placed over the property this week\nIt was rumoured that season 13 of The Block, Australia's most popular reality show, would feature an empty lot of land in Elsternwick, but it is now thought it will focus on The Gatwick\nBut recently Rose and Yvette's ability to keep a lid on The Gatwick's unsavoury aspects have slipped, draining support from those who had previously flown the flag.\nIn the final years of its operation, police were forced to attend the property up to five times a day, according to some reports, fostering concerns that the hotel was endangering, rather than helping, those living there.\nSome suggested that homeless people were actively avoiding it, preferring to take their chances on the street.\nA recent report detailed a list of 50 crimes allegedly committed there over a six-month period, including arson, a stabbing, two rapes, at least 19 drug offences.\nThe property had been on the market for four years, with an asking price of $12million, in the hopes that a charitable organisation might step in to purchase it. But there were no takers.\nNow it seems as if the former house of ill-repute, branded at various times as 'the hotel hell', a 'festering flophouse and flea-pit', and a 'hotbed of villainy' is set for a prime-time slot on family TV.\nSpeaking about the closure with ABC, Ms Banks confessed: 'It's a very hard decision to make. It didn't come easy but I think enough is enough.'\nFilming for Season 13 of The Block is due to take place between April and July this year, with an expected release date of late 2017","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4318200/Dark-past-Gatwick-Hotel-Block-s-newest-project.html"}
