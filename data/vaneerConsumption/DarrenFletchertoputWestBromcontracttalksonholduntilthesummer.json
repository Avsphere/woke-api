I’m not sure quite how that managed to be.\n“Probably when you sign at the last minute of a transfer window these things happen that way. There’s no issue, I just want to finish the season and keep playing.”\nFletcher has made 92 appearances for the Baggies – starting all 86 Premier League games – after signing a two-and-a-half year deal from United in February 2015.\nBoss Tony Pulis wants to keep the Scotland international and expects a deal to be done, with Fletcher relaxed on his future.\n“That’s the way it is really. I’m sure It will be sorted sooner rather than later,” Fletcher added.\n“I’m completely relaxed about it and I think the club is completely relaxed about it.\n“There’s no real panic. From my point of view it’s a completely relaxed situation. There’s nothing really going on. It’s just the way it is.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4447294/Darren-Fletcher-West-Brom-contract-talks-hold-summer.html"}
