The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe gunman sought in the shooting deaths of three Mounties was captured early Friday in eastern Canada after a nearly 30-hour manhunt, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.\nPolice identified the suspect as Justin Bourque, 24, who allegedly killed the three officers and injured two other Mounties on Wednesday in Moncton, a city in the province of New Brunswick.\nHe was captured at 12:10 a.m. Friday local time (11:10 a.m. ET) without incident in a wooded area of Moncton, said RCMP Superintendent Marlene Snowman. No guns were found on him at the time, although firearms were retrieved nearby, she added.\nBourque was charged Friday with three counts of first-degree murder, and two counts of attempted murder.\nA Moncton woman told CTV News that she watched the capture in her backyard.\nMichelle Thibodeau said she was in her home when an armored police vehicle came slowly past, then officers jumped out and raced to her backyard, shouting for the suspect to come out.\nShe said the man came out with his arms raised and told police: \"I'm done.\"\nThe three officers were killed and two others injured about 7:30 p.m. local time (6:30 p.m. ET) Wednesday. The officers, all from the Codiac Regional RCMP, were shot after responding to a call about a man with a gun, police said.\nThey were identified as constables David Ross, 32; Fabrice Gevaudan, 45; and Douglas Larche, 40.\nThe two injured officers are \"recovering well,\" police said at a Friday morning news conference.\n\"It will take time to heal, but together we will get there,\" Snowman said.\nDuring the search through city neighborhoods, residents had been told to stay inside with doors locked or had been prevented from returning home. People driving by a police checkpoint early Friday cheered for officers in live video on CTV.\n\"We have a combination of elation and happiness over this arrest and at the same time sadness over the great loss these families have suffered,\" Moncton Mayor George LeBlanc told CTV, referring to the slain officers.\nA motive in the shootings remains unclear.\nA Facebook page that appeared to belong to Bourque contains numerous postings from gun-rights groups, anti-police sentiment and song lyrics.\n\"Ask yourself, would you fight for the future of your children or grandchildren, or your family and friends sons and daughters? The answer is: no you're too stupid to know what to fight for, cause we're already losing the silent war you don't wanna believe is happening,\" an April 7 posting reads.\nThe last update to the page was made hours before the shooting and quoted a Megadeth song. Below it, after the bloodshed, a friend posted a message: \"You knew this wasn't the answer.\"\nAn image from the Times and Transcript newspaper showed a man in camouflage with a bandanna around his forehead carrying an assault-style rifle, with another weapon slung over his shoulder.\nThe suspect appeared to have a tactical shotgun on his back with a collapsible stock and shotgun shells strapped to his bottom, said NBC law enforcement analyst Jim Cavanaugh. He also appeared to be carrying a sniper rifle, possibly .308 caliber, and a detachable magazine, he added.\nMoncton is a city of about 70,000 people three hours up the coast from the border between Canada and Maine.\nThe last Mountie to die by gunfire, according to an honor roll on the RCMP website, was Constable Douglas Allen Scott, who was shot while responding to a call for assistance involving an impaired driver on Nov. 5, 2007, in Kimmirut, Nunavut.\nTwo years earlier, four constables were shot to death by a deranged suspect near Mayerthorpe, Alberta, the honor roll says.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/suspect-mounties-slaying-captured-canada-rcmp-n124216"}
