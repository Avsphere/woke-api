So how can we Californians restore, indeed revolutionize, the people’s direct check on the special interests?\nLet me suggest that the Legislature and the governor should enact a law to allow voters to electronically sign ballot measure petitions. If we can allow voter registration online, we can allow e-signatures for ballot measure petitions. We need to bring direct democracy into the 21st century. The special interests have gamed the initiative process long enough. E-signatures would be a populist game-changer.\nBob Ryan, San Francisco","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/special-interests-game-the-initiative-process/"}
