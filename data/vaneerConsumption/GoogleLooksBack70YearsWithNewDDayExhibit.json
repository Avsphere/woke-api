The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nGoogle is giving users an interactive look back at D-Day with hundreds of photos and historical documents related to the invasion of Normandy.\nIt’s part of the company’s Cultural Institute, which is kind of like a museum you can visit from your couch. For the 70th anniversary of D-Day, Google put together everything from old newspaper covers to copies of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous prayer to top secret progress reports from the U.S. Military.\nThe collection includes five exhibitions, including one focused on the hardships of American soldiers on the front line and another on the approximately 10,000 codebreakers who worked for the British government.\nOverall, there are 471 pictures and documents to look through, accompanied by text from Wikipedia.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/google-looks-back-70-years-new-d-day-exhibit-n124446"}
