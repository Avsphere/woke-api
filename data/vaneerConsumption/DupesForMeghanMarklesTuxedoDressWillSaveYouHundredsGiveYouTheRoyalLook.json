Meghan Markle wore a mini tuxedo dress to a performance of Hamilton, and now people are scrambling to get the chic and tailored outfit for themselves. Going to a special charity performance of the show in London, the event was a gala event in support of Prince Harry's HIV charity, Sentebale.\nTo attend Markle skipped the usual midi dress or wide leg pant and, instead, wore a very smart blazer cocktail dress, where the mini hit right above her knees, mimicking the look of a long, black tuxedo jacket. She accented the look with pointy black heels and a gold and black box clutch from Jimmy Choo, keeping the look formal and minimalist, which is her go-to aesthetic.\nWhile Markle is known to mix high and low fashion together, picking out affordable retail stores like Zara and J.Crew, and deftly mixing them with high fashion labels, this dress wasn't exactly cheap.\nThe sharp mini is from the luxury brand called Judith and Charles (offers sizes XS-XL, 00-14) which is Canadian-based label that deftly mixes feminine soft touches with well-structured menswear silhouettes and accents.\nWPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nThe particular frock that Markle wore was the Digital Dress, and it runs from sizes 00 to 12, and is available for pre-order on the website. It comes in the black shade that the Duchess stepped out in, but it is also available in Aubergine and Navy. But it's not exactly a \"steal\" — the mini will set you back nearly $600, clocking in at $595. Made out of 97% virgin wool, one could see why the double-breasted tuxedo dress would come with such a hefty price tag.\nBut since not everyone can afford to drop half a thousand dollars on a dress, there are plenty of dupes that will help you mimic that same look.\nPlus Button Tuxedo Dress $50 boohoo For a plus size version, this mini dress features brass buttons and satin lapels, breaking up the all-black look. Where Markle chose to pair her frock with black pointed shoes, gold strappy heels are also an option.
