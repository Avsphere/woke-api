Mike Huckabee announced in a video on his website what he plans to do if he were elected President of the United States.\nThe roughly two-minute video shows Huckabee’s past as having defeated the Clinton machine in Arkansas, alluding to the idea that he could defeat Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, in 2016.\n“One thing that has to happen in America is moving the power away from Washington, where people are so disconnected from the way that so many ordinary Americans live,” Huckabee says in the video.\nHe added, “Power needs to be local and limited because the closer government is to the people, the more accountable it is to the people who are being governed.”\nHuckabee argues to protect Social Security and Medicare and to defeat radical Islam.\nHe is expected to formally launch his presidential campaign in Hope, Arkansas, Tuesday May 5th.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/05/01/huckabee-releases-anti-clinton-agenda-video-before-formal-announcement/"}
