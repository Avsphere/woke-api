Passengers will only be required to arrive 15-minutes before departure and are expected to save around two hours for a round trip between Sydney and Melbourne when compared to commercial flights\nCo-founders Luke Hampshire (right), 28, Alexander Robinson (middle), 32, and Ivan Vysotskiy (left), 37, expect to launch the start-up in July at the latest\nAirly will initially offer 54 flights a week on King Air 350s between Sydney's Bankstown Airport, Melbourne's Essendon Airport and Canberra, with plans to expand to Brisbane followed by holiday destinations like the Gold Coast, Byron Bay and Hamilton Island.\n‘Wherever the demand is we’ll go,’ co-founders Mr Hampshire and Mr Robinson said.\nAlthough Bankstown Airport is further from Sydney's CBD, there is expected to be less air congestion and so will save flyers time regardless.\nEssendon Airport also benefits from not only having lower air congestion, but is just 16km to Melbourne's CBD, compared with 24km for Tullamarine Airport.\nMembers will pay a one-off $1000 joining fee and a monthly fee for unlimited flights of between $2550 and $3750, depending on the flexibility they require.\nMr Hampshire (pictured) said he'd been playing with the idea for 18-months, and that the pair had touched base with one another after discovering they were working on similar concepts and 'shared the same vision'\nMr Hampshire said he'd been playing with the idea for 18-months, and that he touched base with Mr Robinson (pictured) when the pair discovered they were working on similar concepts and 'shared the same vision'\nThe service, which the founders says is aimed at business flyers, will offer bookings up to 30-minutes before departure, with no baggage or cancellation fees, as well as free changes to reservations, and flights which take off no matter how few are flying.\nHOW WILL AIRLY WORK? There are Basic, Business and Enterprise memberships to choose from. Basic: $2550 per month. Comes with two reservation passes which can be reused an unlimited number of times within the month. However, no more than two flights can be booked at one time. Business: $3150 per month. Comes with four reservation passes and opportunity to bring a friend for $1000 return. Enterprise: $3750 per month. Comes with six reservation passes and can be shared between users. There are no extra costs to fly. Membership costs pays for baggage, cancelling or rescheduling flights, parking, bespoke service and concierge at the private terminal, and the flights themselves. Flights will not be cancelled even when under-booked. Passengers are expected to save up to two-hours for round trips between Melbourne and Sydney. Members can arrive 15-minutes before departure.\nWi-fi will not initially be offered on the aircrafts, but will hopefully be added at a later date while free parking is offered on site at the private terminals.\nAnd members will not be security screened at departure or arrival, but will merely have to partake in a National Security Check.\nMr Robinson told Daily Mail Australia, however, that there are 'several security and safety layers in place to ensure the safety of all members, the public and crew'.\n'Airly will operate in full compliance with all applicable security and safety requirements, as this is a key tenet of our operating principles.'\nAside from shaving hours off their travel time, the frequent business flyers will likely also end up saving money on their travel costs.\n‘In short, an Airly Membership provides you access to all the benefits of having your own private plane at a fraction of the cost,’ the website claims, joining what the founders expect to be a 'growing community filled with like-minded individuals including CEOs, Directors, Founders, decision makers and movers and shakers'.\nAlongside the efficiency, Mr Hampshire and Mr Robinson told Daily Mail Australia a secondary benefit is the ‘networking event’ the likeminded members will experience ‘every time you jump on a plane’.\nThey said they'll be launching business as usual in July at the latest, but could have a softer launch by March.\nHowever, the company could be up and running within four weeks of breaking even through membership fees.\n‘Airlines have been ingrained in this ticketed model for 60-odd years,’ the co-founders told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We’re trying to turn it on its head'\nMr Hampshire said he'd been playing with the idea for 18-months, and that the pair had touched base with one another after discovering they were working on similar concepts and 'shared the same vision'.\nMr Hampshire and Mr Robinson, along with third co-founder Mr Vysotskiy (pictured), have all fronted up the initial start-up capital\nBy October they were working at the 'start-up company that's trying to disrupt a solidified industry' full-steam.\nThe co-founders said they’d had an ‘awful lot of interest’ from frequent business travellers who want to save the extra time and ‘help build something and be part of something so different and unheard of in Australia’.\n‘Airlines have been ingrained in this ticketed model for 60-odd years,’ the co-founders told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We’re trying to turn it on its head.’\nThe business model is based on California-based Surf Air, the only difference being that Airly will not own its aircraft.\nMr Hampshire and Mr Robinson, along with third co-founder Mr Vysotskiy, have all fronted up the initial start-up capital.\n‘We’re serious about showing potential investors as well as members that this is something we’re engaged with full-time,’ the co-founders said.\nThe Melbourne-based start-up has ordered their first three King Air 350s from the US through an aircraft management company.\nBrowse the Airly website here.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393036/Start-Airly-membership-based-private-airline-launches-Australia-mission-change-people-fly-Sydney-Melbourne-using-smaller-aircraft-smaller-airport.html"}
