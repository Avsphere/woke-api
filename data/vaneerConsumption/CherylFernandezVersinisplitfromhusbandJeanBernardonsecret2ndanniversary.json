The Girls Aloud star and Ashley tied the knot in a lavish £500,000 ceremony in London in front of Cole's England team-mates Joe Cole, John Terry, Jermaine Jenas, Jermain Defoe and Cheryl's bandmates. But in January 2008, hairdresser Aimee Walton, then 22, sold the story of her one night stand with Cheryl's husband to a national newspaper, claiming she had had sex with Ashley in a friend's flat. Cheryl, who did not sign a pre-nup with the footballer, took Ashley back after the revelations, but in 2010, after four more women came forward and accused Ashley of having an affair, the singer filed for divorce at London's High Court citing 'unreasonable behaviour'. 2010-2011: Derek Hough Cheryl and US dancer Derek stayed tight-lipped about their brief romance back in 2010, never confirming that they were a couple despite being spotted out and about together. But three later the Dancing With the Stars star revealed that the pair did date briefly and now remain good friends. 2012-2013: Tre Holloway In 2010 Cheryl met another dancer, Tre Holloway, when she performed Promise This on the X Factor in 2010, with the couple going public with a romance in the summer of 2012. In November of that year the notoriously private Cheryl opened up about her new man, who was based in LA. Speaking in her documentary Cheryl: Access All Areas, she said: 'There is a stronger connection and a chemistry you wouldn't have with any other dancer. To have that relationship is rare, to be able to have it with you and share those moments is pretty special actually.' But a year later and the 14-month romance was over amid claims the long distance was too much to handle. An upset Cheryl took to Twitter in the wake of her split news to thank her fans, aka her 'little soldiers' for their support. She wrote: 'Sometimes I just sit here by myself wondering why you're all so kind and nice and caring towards me. It's gets overwhelming. #soldiers Thank you for everything I mean that from the [heart] I love you. You're amazing.'\nSubtle hints? The singer also did little to quash divorce claims when she revealed her sudden urge to make new music with a moody-looking selfie last week\nThe social media savvy star looked to share another seemingly loaded message on New Year's Eve with an image that saw her stand naked and kiss her middle finger, in the midst of her rumoured marriage crisis.\n'Bye 2015.. you've been real!!!!! You have taught me a lot but I am happy to see the back of you!!..,' she wrote alongside the fiery photo.\nIf the reports are true, the Call My Name hitmaker could be forced to part with half of her £20million fortune as she allegedly did not sign a pre-nuptial agreement before marrying Jean-Bernard after a whirlwind romance.\nThe couple married in a secret ceremony in Mustique in July 2014 after three months of dating.\nSecret split? According to The Sunday Mirror , the 32-year-old singer has cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split, with the couple allegedly deciding to break up in August\nSupport: While JB was a familiar face at the X Factor studios in 2014, he did not attend his wife's show as often for the latest series in 2015\nAt the time it was reported that the couple were so in love that Cheryl 'refused' to protect her fortune with a pre-nup.\nJames Brown, a partner in Manchester law firm JMW, previously told the Daily Star: 'In the event Cheryl and her new partner divorce, the starting point for the court will be that her husband is entitled to half her wealth.\n'Although she might be successful arguing for a smaller amount, the process can take time and is expensive and immensely stressful.'\nCheryl also refused to sign a pre-nup when she married footballer Ashley in 2006, saying at the time she found the concept ‘disgusting’.\nShe said: ‘I think that’s defeating the point. We’re getting married because we’re committing ourselves to each other to spend the rest of our lives together. No ifs and buts.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3393589/Cheryl-Fernandez-Versini-split-husband-Jean-Bernard-secret-second-anniversary.html"}
