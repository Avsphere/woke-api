Picture shot by Tamryn Keith\nMs Johnson was driving down Sir Condor Laucke Way on her way home on December 18 when a car started turning into her lane...\nThe white hatchback showed no signs of stopping as it began to veer onto the wrong side of the road. Ms Johnson was returning from a trip to the chiropractor and the shops at the time\nThe registered nurse told Daily Mail Australia she did not have a chance to do anything or even slow down before the car rammed her\nThis is the moment the tourist car struck her vehicle - which Ms Johnson thankfully escaped unharmed\n'The car just came out in front of me and I just had no chance to do anything, not even slow down to try to avoid the situation,' Ms Johnson said.\nMaking matters worse, the German father and son were both deaf making it difficult for her to explain she was pregnant.\nThe tourists were also quite slow to respond after the crash, Ms Johnson said. 'They didn't do anything, actually.\n'It took me about four or five times to explain I was pregnant and that was my main concern.'\n'Once they got that, they gave me a hug and just felt awful - I didn't mean to make them feel awful or not.'\nA witness called emergency services and Ms Johnson rang her husband Sean, who just wanted her to get out of there.\nMs Johnson was eventually taken to Lyell McEwin hospital to check the baby was OK. The child's heart started racing at one stage, but thankfully everyone escaped the incident uninjured.\n'He just wanted to get me out of where I was,' Ms Johnson said of her husband, Sean (the pair are pictured together)\nMs Johnson (pictured left, right) captured in the incident on her dash cam in horrifying footage\nMangled mess: The couple's Ford Falcon FG XR8 was written off by the car crash with the tourists\nThe tourists' vehicle was left in a similarly poor condition, these photographs taken by Ms Johnson show\nMs Johnson captured the incident in full with her dashboard camera and took pictures of both wrecked vehicles.\nShe told Daily Mail Australia she does not think every tourist was a bad driver, but stressed they must be more aware of their surroundings when they get behind the wheel.\n'I think they just need to be more aware and concentrate instead of being all over the road,' she said.\nGermans drive on the right hand side of the road while Australians drive on the left.\nMs Johnson is due to give birth to her first born on February 10.\nShe and husband Sean are keeping the child's gender a surprise.\nSouth Australian police were contacted for comment.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393127/Watch-terrifying-moment-deaf-German-tourists-driving-WRONG-road-smash-pregnant-woman-s-car-leaving-fearing-baby-s-life.html"}
