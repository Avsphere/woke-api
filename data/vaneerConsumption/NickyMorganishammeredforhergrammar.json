'Because that would be wrong, that's why,' she snapped.\nIt's not the first time Morgan's grammar has been called into question. While she was Education Secretary, her reply to a letter from a teacher hit the headlines because it was littered with punctuation errors.\nMary Davies, from Yarm, in North Yorkshire, had written to Morgan to express her concerns about changes to the testing of writing and spelling at Key Stage 2.\nHowever, the letter she received in response contained five mistakes — with Mrs Davies taking to Facebook to point out the irony.\nLast December, Morgan, 44, hit the headlines when she took a personal swipe at Mrs May for wearing a £995 pair of leather trousers and suggested they were the height of political vulgarity.\n'I don't have leather trousers,' she shuddered in an interview. 'I don't think I've spent that much on anything, apart from my wedding dress.'\nBut critics pointed out that Morgan herself has often been seen carrying a £950 bag from upmarket Mulberry.\nSweet dreams: Sam Cam sister's 'bedtime' snap\nEmily Sheffield, Vogue deputy editor and sister of Samantha Cameron, gives Conde Nast supermodels a run for their money as she poses in bed for this sultry holiday snap which she captions 'bed time'.\nClearly, she thought better of sharing the picture, however, as she appears to have swiftly deleted it from social media.\nYou might have thought Emily had learned her lesson about publishing pictures of people in bed after she took a photo of her younger sibling Alice on her wedding day — which inadvertently showed then PM David Cameron enjoying a shoeless afternoon nap on the bride's bed.\nEmily Sheffield, Vogue deputy editor and sister of Samantha Cameron, gives Conde Nast supermodels a run for their money as she poses in bed for this sultry holiday snap\nFormer Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton was among those paying tribute to Elizabeth McMurtry, PR supremo and wife of Daily Mail cartoonist Stan McMurtry AKA Mac, at a memorial service at Chelsea Old Church yesterday. Liz was the 'secret lady' who featured somewhere in all of Mac's celebrated cartoons.\n'Mac does wicked things,' she confided to friends. 'He once made me the face of a naked lady in a tattoo on a sailor's arm.'\nWhy Bond girl Seymour isn't Solitaire\nAlthough she divorced her fourth husband in 2015, former Bond girl Jane Seymour, 66, doesn't lack for male company.\nThe Middlesex-born actress, who starred as Solitaire with Roger Moore in Live And Let Die, was at a charity dinner in Tennessee with her twin son Johnny Keach, 21. His father, director James Keach, split up with Seymour after 22 years.\nJane was previously married to theatre director Michael Attenborough, artist Geoffrey Planer and business manager David Flynn, by whom she has two other children.\n'I perfected the art of getting married too soon,' she admits. 'It doesn't look good on paper. But in my household there was a pressure that you weren't supposed to have sex until you were married.'\nAlthough she divorced her fourth husband in 2015, former Bond girl Jane Seymour, 66, doesn't lack for male company\nNovelist Dame Margaret Drabble is in mourning for her daughter Rebecca Swift, sister of TV gardener Joe Swift, who has died of cancer aged 53. 'She was such a warm, funny, lovely person — how I loved her presence in my classroom,' says her old Latin teacher, Terry Buckley, of Camden School for Girls.\n'She had a smile that could light up the darkest room. She will be missed in this increasingly insensitive world.'\nDuke's girl is a sultry senorita\nGood to see Lady Amelia Windsor getting into the sartorial swing ahead of the Spanish state visit this summer.\nThe 21-year-old model and Edinburgh University student wore a flamenco-style dress as she posed for an ad for footwear designer Penelope Chilvers. Dubbed the most beautiful member of the Royal Family, the Duke of Kent's granddaughter was taking part in El Rocio, a religious pilgrimage in Andalucia, Spain.\nIt's not the first time Chilvers has had the royal seal of approval — the Duchess of Cambridge wore the designer's boots during a royal visit to Bhutan last year.\nThe 21-year-old model and Edinburgh University student wore a flamenco-style dress as she posed for an ad for footwear designer Penelope Chilvers\nTrinny: Ageing's crueller for girls\nNigella Lawson's ex-husband Charles Saatchi and his current partner Trinny Woodall may not be at each other's throats, but he is, it seems, somewhat ungallant towards her by expounding his views that men age better than women.\nSays fashionista Trinny, 53, of Saatchi, 73: 'My boyfriend says that leading men always look so much better when they are older.\n'You know — Liam Neeson, George Clooney — all these guys, they look fantastic.\n'I think it's harder for a woman to accept herself ageing because, on camera, a man with grey hair looks great, but on a woman we might not think it looks so good.'\nTrinny admits to having had cosmetic help: 'I've had Botox since I was 35. There's obviously more pressure for women and fewer rules for men of that age.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-4446018/Nicky-Morgan-hammered-grammar.html"}
