Scientists there are studying the genetics and biology of this mosquito, which transmits the Zika virus\nZIKA VIRUS: WHAT IS IT AND HOW CAN IT BE PREVENTED? The Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito (inset), which is also known to carry yellow fever. The terrifying virus has now started to spread across the Americas How it spreads: Zika virus is spread to people via mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivtis. Infected patients are typically ill for a few days to a week. While the illness is generally mild, some experts in Brazil have suggested a possible link between the virus in pregnant women and subsequent birth defects. The CDC said recently it is aware of reports of increased numbers of babies born with microcephaly, or smaller than expected head size, in Brazil. The Ministry of Health in Brazil is concerned about a possible association between the Zika virus and increased numbers of babies born with microcephaly. How to prevent it: There is no vaccine to prevent, or medicine to treat Zika virus. Travellers can protect themselves by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites, such as using a mosquito net and wearing insect repellent. Pregnant women are being warned to avoid travelling to 22 countries were outbreaks have been reported. Source: CDC\nFour other people in New York state, in Monroe, Nassau, Suffolk and Orange counties, have been diagnosed with the virus, according to NBC.\nThe latest update came on the day the scientists warned Zika has an 'explosive pandemic potential', and could impact up to four million people.\nFor most people who get infected, the flu-like symptoms will clear up in about a week, but the virus has also been linked to microcephaly - a birth defect which results in an abnormally small head.\nThere are now fears the 2016 Rio Olympics could be affected because of a spike in cases, with some athletes being warned not to go.\nZika cannot be transmitted by casual person-to-person contact. While there is concern that Zika virus may be sexually transmitted, officials at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have said the evidence of sexual transmission is insufficient.\nOfficials said Thursday the 31 people are in 11 states and Washington. In US territories, Puerto Rico has 19 confirmed cases and the US Virgin Islands has one.\nBarbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cape Verde, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadalupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, Venezuela, all have ongoing Zika transmission.\nCanada and Chile are the only countries in the Americas the virus is not expected to reach, the WHO said on Monday.\nUnited Airlines and American Airlines have since announced they will allow customers with tickets to Zika-affected countries to postpone or cancel their trip without penalty.\nNew York City Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker told ABC 7: 'Because Zika virus is primarily transmitted by infected mosquitos, there is very limited chance of local transmission in New York during the winter.\nHeartbreaking: The Zika virus has been blamed for causing severe brain damage to newborn babies. Pictured, Estafany Perreira holds her five-month-old nephew David Henrique Ferreira, who has microcephaly, in Recife, Brazil\nNew York City Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker (pictured in October) has said he will be taking preventative measures to stop the spread of the virus, adding that the risks are far higher when mosquitoes are more active in the summer\n'Even so, the Department of Health is taking steps now to protect the health of all New Yorkers and to prepare for the warmer months when mosquitos will be active in New York.\nThe mosquito species that transmits Zika is prevalent in the South, but has not been seen in northeast states,\nThe government is looking at the issue of blood donations from travelers, although officials think the virus is gone from an infected person's blood in a week or less.\nMeanwhile the World Health Organization said Zika had gone from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions and admitted up to four million people could be infected.\nThe agency will convene an emergency committee of disease experts on Monday.\nIt comes after US experts claimed WHO was not taking a leadership role in the Zika pandemic.\nThey said the organisation needed to learn lessons from its handling of the Ebola epidemic where the 'agency's failure to act decisively cost thousands of lives'.\nZika virus is common in parts of Africa and South East Asia, but since 2007 there have been various outbreaks outside of the disease's comfort zone. It spread to South America in 2014, before reaching Mexico and the Caribbean last year. The first US case was reported in Texas at the start of January\nThe Zika virus has been blamed for causing severe brain damage to newborn babies.

No. There is no vaccine to prevent infection or medicine to treat Zika. I AM PREGNANT. SHOULD I TRAVEL TO PLACES WHERE CASES OF ZIKA HAVE BEEN REPORTED? Until more is known, and out of an abundance of caution, CDC recommends special precautions for pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant: Pregnant women in any trimester should consider postponing travel to the areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Pregnant women who do travel to one of these areas should talk to their doctor or other healthcare provider first and strictly follow steps to avoid mosquito bites during the trip. Women trying to become pregnant who are thinking about becoming pregnant should consult with their healthcare provider before traveling to these areas and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during the trip. Because specific areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing are difficult to determine and likely to change over time, CDC will update this travel notice as information becomes available. Check the CDC travel website frequently for the most up-to-date recommendations. IS IT SAFE TO USE INSECT REPELLENT IF I AM PREGANT OR NURSING Yes! Using an insect repellent is safe and effective. Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding can and should choose an EPA-registered insect repellents and use it according to the product label. IF A WOMAN WHO IS NOT PREGNANT IS BITTEN BY A MOSQUITO AND INFECTED WITH ZIKA VIRUS, WILL HER FUTURE PREGNANCIES BE AT RISK? No. If infected Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for about a week. The virus will not cause infections in a baby that is conceived after the virus is cleared from the blood. SHOULD A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO TRAVELED TO AN AREA WITH ZIKA VIRUS BE TESTED FOR THE VIRUS? See your healthcare provider if you are pregnant and develop a fever, rash, joint pain, or red eyes within 2 weeks after traveling to a country where Zika virus cases have been reported. Be sure to tell your health care provider where you traveled.

He gave no time frame.\nScientists had accused the agency of failing to take 'a leadership role in the Zika pandemic'.\nThey said this is particularly urgent given the forthcoming 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the article in the Journal of the American Medical Association said.\nThe virus has recently rampaged through the Caribbean and Latin America.\nIn particular, there is an unprecedented outbreak in Brazil, where in the past 12 months there have been nearly 4,000 cases of babies being born with abnormally small heads.\nOn Tuesday it was revealed Brazil has sent more than 200,000 troops to go 'house to house' in the battle against Zika.\nSoldiers will visit homes across Brazil, distributing leaflets and dispensing advice, according to Health Minister Marcelo Castro, signalling a major ramping up of efforts against the Zika virus.\nThe government, under growing pressure to deal with the crisis, will also hand out repellent to at least 400,000 pregnant women on social welfare.\nMeanwhile, pregnant women have already been officially warned to avoid travelling to South America.\nThe US and other world leaders have called for swift action in developing a vaccine for the virus but warned it could take up to a decade.\nRio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes says he doesn't believe the spreading Zika virus 'is a problem for the Olympics,' which open in six months in the picturesque South American city.\nHe notes that the games starting August 5 will occur in the drier, cooler South American winter season when controlling the mosquito population 'will be much easier.'\nMeanwhile International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said his organization is in 'close contact' with Brazilian authorities and the World Health Organization about Zika.\nBach said the IOC would send advice this week to all national Olympic committees, which can then tell athletes about safety guidelines.\nLine-up: Brazilian Army soldiers walk while canvassing a neighbourhood in an attempt to eradicate the larvae of the mosquito which causes the Zika virus, while informing the public of preventive methods","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422033/Pregnant-woman-three-people-New-York-City-infected-Zika-virus.html"}
