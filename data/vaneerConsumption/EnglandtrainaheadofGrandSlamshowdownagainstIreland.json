Dylan Hartley captained his side to an 18th successive Test victory last Saturday to match the tier one record set by New Zealand.\nA win in Dublin could put them out in front on their own as the team with the longest unbeaten record in international rugby. The win would also see England become only the sixth team in history to win back-to-back Grand Slams.\nJones has made two changes to face Joe Schmidt's side on the weekend. Billy Vunipola comes in at No 8 to replace Nathan Hughes while Anthony Watson is preferred to Jack Nowell on the right wing.\nWhen the England coach took over in 2015 he challenged Vunipola to become the 'best No 8 in the world' but after a long injury lay-off the young Saracen has work to do to get back to his best.\nJones said: 'He's done well since he's been back into the squad. We feel like he's got the fitness now to start the game, but we've been very happy with Nathan. What we do know with is that between those two we are going to get a great 80 minutes out of No 8.\n'But Billy is a special sort of player, he brings energy, he brings certain qualities to the team, so we are happy to have him back.\nOwen Farrell concentrates as he receives the ball during the session at Pennyhill Park\nThe utility back will retain his place at inside centre where he has played all tournament\nYoungs fires from the back of the driving maul out to his back-line during a lineout drill\nMaro Itoje offloads from the top of the lineout as James Haskell and Mako Vunipola lift\n'He hasn't played for a long time, so he hasn't been the best No 8 in the world. Where he left off in the autumn, he's certainly a very good player. There are some good number eights in the world.\n'He's got to start again now and get back on the horse and the horse has to be heavy enough to carry him.'\nJones also paid tribute to the contribution of his predecessor Stuart Lancaster, who was sacked in 2015 after England became the first home team to be knocked out of a World Cup at the pool stages.\n'It won't be an achievement for me, it will be an achievement for the team,' Jones said. 'We are in this together, coaching staff, staff and the players, we all work together. The guy I think again that should get a lot of credit for the team's success is Stuart Lancaster. He was the guy that brought this team through, went through some hard yards with them, most of the players are still the same.'\nThe squad trained at Pennyhill Park with Schmidt's team in mind. Jones put a focus on gaining parity in the lineout and quelling the threat of the Irish forwards.\nCourtney Lawes and Maro Itoje were both used as lineout jumpers in training and will be the primary weapons used to combat the likes of Donnacha Ryan and Devin Toner in the Ireland lineout.\nItoje wins the jump against Courtney Lawes in the lineout drill and pops the ball off the top\nThe England pack gathers together to regroup during the forwards' drills\nEngland captain Dylan Hartley prepares to put another ball into the lineout\nIn the back-line England have had a little more scope to change things around and Ben Youngs appeared busy in the session. The scrum-half orchestrated the moves and link-ups between the forward and back lines as he retains a starting berth this weekend while Danny Care watched on.\nEngland lead the table in both points scored and tries scored thanks to the explosive back-line they have at their disposal.\nENGLAND'S SIX NATIONS RESULTS Feb 4 - England 19-16 France Feb 11 - Wales 16-21 England Feb 26 - England 36-15 Italy March 11 - England 61-21 Scotland\nLast week's thrashing of Scotland saw Jonathan Joseph pick up a hat-trick, Care score twice and substitutes Anthony Watson and Vunipola both touching down.\nThe backs England have in their armoury have taken the Six Nations by storm. Too quick, too powerful and too skilful, leaving the rest of the compeition in their wake.\nThe build up to Saturday's clash has been overshadowed by Sportsmail's exclusive revelation the RFU are attempting to reschedule a fixture with world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on November 4.\nJones added: 'I've got no view on that, I'm not an administrator. I haven't negotiated contracts, all I'm worried about is Ireland.\nWing Anthony Watson will return to the starting XV this weekend as he talks with Farrell\nJones watched on as his team prepared for a possible record-beating weekend in Ireland\nBilly Vunipola also gets the nod this weekend as he comes in to replace Nathan Hughes\n'If the All Blacks want to turn up to the Aviva Stadium on Saturday and want to play us after Ireland, then we'll consider it. As I said, the only thing I'm concerned about is beating Ireland.'\n'We talk about complacency all the time. We're consistently looking out for small things that lead to complacency but it's always around the corner, it's always lurking in the shadows.\n'We train hard, make sure we prepare well and that's all you can do. You can just focus on the next game and try to prepare as well as you can and we've done that but it can always jump out of the corner.'\nIreland will have a point to prove when they welcome Jones's men to the Aviva Stadium this weekend.\nA comprehensive loss to Wales deflated a campaign which never truly recovered after the opening weekend loss to Scotland.\nAlthough Schmidt's side have not played to their full potential so far in the tournament, England will face a stern Ireland side who will be on their home patch.\nIreland romped to victory in Rome when they beat Italy 63-10 and also overcame a tricky French side at the Aviva Stadium. With the added incentive of St Patrick's weekend, Ireland will not be a side to roll over against the world's most in form outfit.\nThe squad gathers in a circle as coach Eddie Jones watches the players from the outside\nMike Brown will retain his place at full-back when England make the trip to Dublin\nElliot Daly also gets another starting berth after scoring two tries in the tournament so far","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-4320068/England-train-ahead-Grand-Slam-showdown-against-Ireland.html"}
