Every vote for him is a vote for a coalition of chaos.'\nThe brutal attack came as Mr Corbyn returned to his much-mocked tactic of reading out questions sent to him by members of the public.\nHe failed to lay a glove on the PM after dotting around between subjects including public sector pay and housing.\nWith polls consistently showing the Tories have an advantage of more than 20 points over Labour, it could be his last turn in the regular Commons session.\nMrs May was repeatedly quizzed on whether the Conservative manifesto will repeat the 'triple lock' pledge - which sees the state pension go up by the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent.\nBORIS WADES INTO ELECTION BATTLE BY WARNING CORBYN WON'T KEEP UK SAFE Boris Johnson will join the election battle tonight with a stark warning that Jeremy Corbyn is unable to keep the country safe. After a low-key start to the campaign, the Foreign Secretary will make his first major intervention in a speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet. 'There can be no more important task of a government than to keep its people safe,' he will say. 'Now is not the time to step back, as some would want, but step up.' Conflicts in the Middle East and the tense US stand-off with North Korea demonstrate the need for 'clear leadership to navigate this period of uncertainty', he will add.\nThe PM stopped short of giving a commitment, but insisted the Tories had a record of standing up for pensioners.\n'Under this government pension incomes would continue to increase,' she insisted.\nTormenting Mr Corbyn in the chamber, Mrs May held up a piece of paper highlighting the website 'I Like Corbyn, But...', which she told MPs had been shared on Twitter by shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.\n'She has directed her supporters, her followers to a website 'I Like Corbyn, But...'\n'It says 'How will he pay for all this?', 'But, I've heard he wants to increase taxes', 'But, I've heard he's a terrorist sympathiser', 'But, his attitudes about defence worry me'.\n'They are right to be worried. Unable to defend our country, determined to raise tax on ordinary workers, no plan to manage our economy.\n'Even his own supporters know he's not fit to run this country.'\nMr Corbyn asked Mrs May a series of questions from members of the public about the NHS, education, pensions and wages, noting this was different to 'hand-picked audiences who can't ask questions' the PM is used to dealing with.\nThe Labour leader also accused Mrs May and the Conservatives of being 'strong against the weak and weak against the many'.\nAn Ipsos Mori poll today showed 61 per cent of voters back Mrs May as the best person to be PM - outscoring the highest recorded ratings of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\nBy contrast Mr Corbyn was endorsed by just 23 per cent.\nThe new survey, for today's Evening Standard, showed the Conservative Party was on 49 per cent and Labour 26 per cent.\nTheresa May has been backed as the best person to be Prime Minister by 61 per cent of voters, outscoring the highest recorded ratings of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair\nThe Prime Minister also jibed that Mr Corbyn would 'crash the economy' and raise taxes\nThe huge 23-point lead from Ipsos Mori is in line with most other polls since Mrs May shocked Westminster by calling a snap election last week.\nGideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: 'The Conservatives' focus on leadership seems to be working for them â€“ it was a key strength of theirs in 2015, and now their lead has increased even further.\n'Voters also say leadership is a more important issue.\n'The commitment of their supporters is also striking, compared with other parties.\n'This has all helped them to match their biggest lead we've ever recorded in an election campaign, back in 1983.'\nThe huge 23-point lead from Ipsos Mori is in line with most other polls since Mrs May shocked Westminster by calling a snap election last week","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447340/Theresa-lashes-Corbyn-PMQs-election.html"}
