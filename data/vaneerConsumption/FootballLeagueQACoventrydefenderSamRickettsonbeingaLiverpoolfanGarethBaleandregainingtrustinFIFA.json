His father is international show jumper Derek Ricketts, while seven times National Hunt Champion Jockey John Francome is his uncle. In spite of that, he declares John Barnes as his boyhood sporting idol and names Bobby Moore as the central defensive partner he would love to have had.\nIn our latest Football League Q&A, Coventry's Sam Ricketts discusses his hardest opponent and lots more\nWere you always a defender?\nYes, except for when I was very young when I was a midfielder for my village and then coming through at Oxford until the age of 14 or so. I was desperate to be a centre forward but wasn't good enough. Up to the age of 22, 23 I played every position except centre forward. Then I became just a defender. When I was younger and the game was different I preferred full-back because you'd be able to get forward more and it would be more enjoyable rather than being an old-fashioned defender who was basically there just to head it and tackle. Now with play starting out from the centre backs, you are involved in the play a lot more with the ball at your feet and I enjoy that aspect.\nBest moment on a football pitch?\nIt's hard to say. You always remember your promotions as much as anything, so I'll say my first one with Swansea, promotion from League Two, because I'd just come out of non-league. I'd dropped out of the League when I was 21, so that was my first year back in League football. That was when my career really started to progress and take off.\nThe final game of the (2004/05) season we beat Bury away 1-0. Southend drew and that meant that we went up. Swansea are a very well supported club and we had at least half the ground at Bury. Our game was getting delayed because our fans were coming over the pitch. They were literally stood on the touchline down all one side and behind the goal and they kept coming on. It meant our game was late to finish. We knew that Southend had finished and that we needed to hang on and not concede. We were under pressure late on in the game and Bury had the odd chance.\nThat stands out even above the Play-Off Final at Wembley with Hull and my Wales debut simply because I'd just come out of non-league. It propelled me and my career.\nRicketts rises highest to head a cross clear during a Premier League game for Hull against Aston Villa\nIs there one regret you need to put right?\nGetting relegated from the Premier League with Bolton (in 2011/12). It was the day that Man City scored two goals in injury time to win the league. We were relying on them to beat QPR and if we had won at Stoke, we would have stayed up. I just think that in the latter stages of the game, when we were getting reports back that QPR were winning 2-1 going into injury time, I look back and I don't know if we tried hard enough to get a winning goal in the last five minutes. I'm not sure that we envisaged Man City coming back in the last five minutes and winning the league like they did, so we didn't have the mad finish we should have had. If we had managed to get another goal, we wouldn't have got relegated.\nIt was a shame because you see the knock-on effect for Bolton now. That probably started by losing out on Premier League money. After that, different things happen over the years. It's a club which I really enjoyed being at. It's the longest I've been at any club, four years, and it was a club that I didn't really want to leave when I did. I'd like to see Bolton back in the Premier League if possible one day.\nHardest opponent?\nGareth Bale. I've played in every position against him. Gareth is one of those players who can beat you with skill, he can beat you with pace, he can score from 30 yards and then he can also score headers from corners. So he really does have everything. You can't stand off him because then he'll just pick up speed and run at you. If you get too tight, especially when he had Luka Modric with him at Spurs, they would play one-twos and play around you.\nI'm not saying that Gareth ever gave me a really, really bad time but I knew every time that I played against him – probably because I know him so well – that my concentration really had to be excellent for the whole 90 minutes. I've known Gareth since he was 16 when he first came into the Wales team.\nIt can make it worse if you've seen someone in training because you know their strengths and you're always worrying about them. I just used to tell him to go and play on the other wing, otherwise I was going to kick him.\nGareth Bale, pictured celebrating for Real Madrid, is the hardest opponent Ricketts has faced in his career\nLeast favourite away ground?\nSunderland. I think I've only ever won there once – in the FA Cup (a 2-0 third round replay win for Bolton in January 2013). And it's a ground which is on a side of a hill, so that when you get there, it's always, always windy and cold when you get off the bus. You go in the ground and it's always cold. Then over the years, apart from that one victory in the FA Cup, I've never had a good record there. I've been sent off there as well.\nYour favourite dressing room song before a match?\nYou're not talking to the right person talking about music. I wouldn't say I have a particular favourite, but as a Liverpool fan, playing there when they sing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' before the game is a great experience.\nEven as an opposition player you try and embrace it. I'm a Liverpool fan so it probably means more to me than it does to most people. To hear The Kop singing that, especially when you're in the tunnel waiting to come down, it never gets boring.\nWhen I dropped down to non-league, the thought of being able to play against Liverpool never really entered my mind, let alone playing at Anfield.\nWhat's your guilty food pleasure?\nChocolate. Just plain chocolate. I'm not into Haribos or sweets. Just chocolate like Galaxy or Dairy Milk. I ration myself but it depends whether I think I deserve it or not. If I've had a good game, I might have a little bit more than maybe I should do, but generally I try to keep it under control.\nRicketts says Sunderland's Stadium of Light is his least favourite ground after winning just once there\nBoyhood sporting hero?\nJohn Barnes. He was someone I followed and he just fell into being my favourite player. It was also because of the way that he conducted himself as one of the first black players. He was very calm, never irrational and he would never react to anything. He had a lot of racist abuse when he was playing but he would never get flustered about it.\nIf you had the power, what one thing would you change about the game?\nI'm caught between two things. One is video analysis but I don't know how you would bring that in because you don't want to stop the flow of the game.\nThe other one, which is very obvious at the minute, is that the game needs sorting out structurally at FIFA. The game hasn't been run right for a long while. I think they have to be very transparent.\nIn the modern world there is always someone trying to influence voting, especially when there's so much money riding on who hosts World Cups.\nFIFA needs new leaders, and probably all of the voting needs to be transparent so that you can see who has voted for whom.\nYou are talking a long time for people to trust FIFA again, a minimum of five, 10 years, if not longer.\nWorst football kit you've seen?\nI saw a really bad one recently, a multi-coloured one with one sleeve being one colour, the main body being another colour and the other sleeve a different one again – Birmingham's away kit. It's unbelievable. I wouldn't want to play in it and I don't really understand the reason behind a kit such as that.\nRicketts chases down Russia's Andrey Arshavin (right) in 2008 during one of his 52 caps for Wales\nMost embarrassing moment in football?\nMany, many years ago when I was at Swansea I was ill and I was sick on the pitch two or three times. I have to say that I didn't find it too embarrassing because there was nothing I could do about it, but enough people have told me about it over the years. People who were there or players who were in the opposite team. I couldn't get off the pitch because I kept stopping to be sick. I was just ill but I didn't feel it before I went on the pitch.\nIt was in the second half of a Football League Trophy game, a semi-final against Colchester. I was defending and I just had to stop and be sick.\nYears later I played with players who were in the other team and they brought it up so it's never really been forgotten.\nI was replaced even though the manager, Kenny Jackett, told me just to stick my fingers down my throat and get on with it. I don't think he realised I was quite as ill as I was.\nWhich player in history would you like to play alongside?\nBobby Moore, because of the way that he played the game and being a centre half as well. You go back to the bits you can see of him playing against Pele and how he tackled him. His style of defending was probably years ahead of what defending was about at the time.\nI would try and learn from him, that would be the biggest thing, try and emulate him, and hopefully he could help me and teach me.\nAs proud sponsors of the Football League, Sky Bet are giving all customers a £10 free in-play on every televised Friday Sky Bet Football League match this month when you place a £25 bet on that match.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3421307/Football-League-Q-Coventry-defender-Sam-Ricketts-Liverpool-fan-Gareth-Bale-regaining-trust-FIFA.html"}
