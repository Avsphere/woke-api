So their arrest stopped her from exercising her First Amendment rights,” Baylis added.\nThe Sanders rally took place on March 23 at the Wiltern Theater. Ma was wearing a skirt without any underwear on and had masking tape covering her nipples with the words “free the nipple” and “feel the bern” strewn across her chest and torso. She later removed the masking tape from her nipples, which is when she got into trouble for indecent exposure.\nMa noted her view to ABC 7 that the woman’s body is “hyper-sexualized,” and that by appearing in public topless she was “existing in a non-sexual position where many people don’t get to see that very often.”\nMa has been one of the main activists in the “free the nipple” movement. An alumnus of the University of California San Diego, she led over 100 male and female participants in a “free the nipple” protest at the school last May.\nMiley Cyrus and Scout Willis — Demi Moore and Bruce Willis’s daughter — have also participated in the movement.\nPhoto: file\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/local/2016/08/07/bernie-sanders-topless-woman-sues-lapd/"}
