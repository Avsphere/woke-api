GM's US sales were up five percent at 3.1 million vehicles last year.\nIn a huge shift, GM will soon begin selling vehicles made in China in the United States.\nGM's decision to import the Buick Envision from China -- a first for a major automaker -- has sparked outrage and is expected to become an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\"The general strategy we have in the company is to build where we sell,\" Barra said. \"In this case it wasn't economical to tool it here.\"\nBarra -- who was recently tapped as GM's first female chairman -- did not rule out the possibility that the Envision could eventually be built in the United States but said importing it was the only way to round out Buick's US offerings in the near-term.\nThe largest US automaker sold over 1.2 million Buicks in China last year and only 223,000 in the United States.\nWhile the Envision will help boost those numbers by rounding out Buick's offerings in the fast-growing crossover segment, it is still only expected to reach sales of about 40,000 vehicles in the near-term in the United States.\nBarra declined to say whether she was concerned that turmoil on the US stock market could hit demand in the United States, which posted record sales last year.\n\"What we focus on is performance and what's in our control,\" she said after introducing a new sports car concept, the Buick Avista, at a reception in Detroit.\n\"We're going to keep working hard to make sure we put vehicles out, keeping the customer at the center of everything we do, building the brand and serving the customer.\"\nBarra also dismissed rumors that she had met with Fiat Chrysler chief Sergio Marchionne to discuss a merger.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3393255/GM-bullish-China-despite-volatile-outlook-chief.html"}
