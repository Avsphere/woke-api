As part of a 2016 calendar, several Atlanta-area chefs posed wearing nothing but Hedley and Bennett aprons with the farmers who grow their food. Proceeds from the calendar, available for $20 at the Peachtree Road Farmer's Market , will benefit The Farmer Fund, an Atlanta nonprofit founded to serve Metro Atlanta farmers in the face of natural disaster.\nNotables include Steven Satterfield of Miller Union , who graces the cover with Darby Smith of Sun Dog Farmer , plus an adorable goat; Zeb Stevenson of Watershed , who poses with Paula Guilbeau of Heirloom Gardens ; and Todd Ginsberg of The General Muir , who poses with Chris Edwards of Mayflor Farms .\nCheck out all the photos here.\nFor more stories like this, visit the Atlanta Restaurant Scene blog, like Atlanta Restaurant Scene on Facebook and follow Atlanta Dining on Twitter.\nRead the AJC Dining Guide, Atlanta Around the Clock, here.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/atlanta-restaurants/atlanta-chefs-pose-nothing-but-aprons-for-calendar/YqUY4cfLL5DdSBEMkcPNzL/"}
