No porn, no radicalism and no copyright infringement,\" he told AFP.\n\"We informed them a while ago, and we are still waiting for Netflix's response.\"\nAll films screened in Indonesia are approved first by the Film Censorship Board, with offending sections removed.\nPornographic websites are also blocked, and blogs and other online content deemed either extremist or inappropriate are routinely shut down by the communications ministry.\nNetflix is not the first Internet-based company to run into regulatory obstacles in Indonesia, with video-sharing website Vimeo banned, and ride-sharing service Uber struggling to set up in Southeast Asia's largest economy.\nBut it is a blow for the streaming pioneer, which boasts 70 million subscribers and just this month heralded its expansion into 130 new markets as the birth of a new global Internet TV network.\nTelkom and government officials insist the block is only temporary, and would be lifted if Netflix obtained the required permits and agreed to censorship requirements.\n\"Just comply and we will reopen access,\" Telkom spokesman Arif Prabowo told AFP.\n\"We are not talking about the business, this is just a matter of abiding by the law.\"\nNetflix could not be immediately reached for comment.\nSome Telkom competitors were capitalising on the ban Thursday, promoting their Netflix packages in a bid to lure Telkom customers angered by the move.\n\"I felt cheated,\" Devi Asmarani, a Jakarta-based writer, told AFP after buying a new TV a fortnight ago specifically to enjoy Netflix.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420582/Indonesia-telecoms-firm-blocks-Netflix-local-laws-censorship.html"}
