Stiles has worked in the Fulton County police department for more than 30 years.\n“Gary Stiles has served this department with distinction for decades and has a unique understanding of our employees and community,” Fulton County commission chairman John Eaves said.\nJones, a 35-year veteran of the police department, retired in the wake of a report by Fox 5 that she taught a weekly criminal justice class in the middle of the day and often worked from home on Mondays. Jones told the station she did not teach the class on police time.\nThe station also reported she hired a chaplain to be a detective, though he didn’t report to work or have a direct supervisor.\nJones said,“I think it’s time (to retire).”\nShe had been chief since 2007.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/fulton-county-picks-stiles-only-finalist-for-police-chief/CKDvd56roy4wODuDytSgvO/"}
