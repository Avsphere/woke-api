By the time British combat forces left Iraq in 2009, the conflict had killed 179 U.K. troops, almost 4,500 U.S. personnel and more than 100,000 Iraqis.\nThe Iraq War Inquiry led by retired civil servant John Chilcot concluded last year that Blair led Britain into the war through a mix of flawed intelligence, inadequate planning and poor judgment. But it refrained from saying whether the invasion was legal and didn't accuse Blair of deliberately misleading the public or Parliament.\nThe parliamentary committee said that there still aren't strong measures to prevent a prime minister from sidelining senior Cabinet colleagues when deciding to go to war.\nCommittee chairman Bernard Jenkin said that before the Iraq invasion, \"there was a lack of collective Cabinet decision-making, at a time when clear thinking and a culture of challenge was most needed.\"\n\"The failure to engage Cabinet on such decisions cannot be allowed to happen again, but there is no mechanism to ensure that,\" he said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4318360/UK-lawmakers-Not-evidence-probe-Blair-Iraq.html"}
