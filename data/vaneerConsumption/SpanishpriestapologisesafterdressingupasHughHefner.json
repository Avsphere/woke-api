At one stage, pictures show one of the Bunnies seemingly astride the priest but onlookers say he fell.\nFather Martinez's immediate boss, senior priest Calixto Covo said he didn't support his choice of costume and it hadn't been the wisest of decisions for a priest to behave in such a manner. However, he confirmed there would be 'no consequences'.\nAt one stage, pictures show one of the Bunnies seemingly astride the priest, although onlookers claim he fell\nParishioners say he is a brilliant priest who has helped numerous charities and increased attendance at the church. Dozens gathered outside his home in a show of support.\n'He's a very happy and open person, it's no wonder he wanted to participate in the parade,' said one resident.\nFather Martinez has described his decision as 'unfortunate' but says he has always dressed up for the carnival.\nAlthough no action is to be taken, the church has recommended the priest takes a few days out to attend a spiritual retreat.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301486/Spanish-priest-apologises-dressing-Hugh-Hefner.html"}
