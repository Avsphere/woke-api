In the end prison bosses decided enough was enough and sent her back to the male wing.”\nAstonishingly, the killer had been accused of similar incidents of “inappropriate behaviour” with female inmates before.\nIn 2013, Green was moved from Corton Vale women’s prison, near Stirling, after claims were made of relations with women at the jail.\nThe sister of the man Green murdered, Pauline Bell, claimed the killer was pretending to be transgendered to game the system.\n“It’s costing the Prison Service a fortune moving him from jail to jail,” she said.\n“The whole thing is a joke. We don’t believe he really wants a sex change. He’s just trying to manipulate the system and the tax payer is footing the bill.”\nThe case follows the high-profile case of Tara Hudson, a biological man who was imprisoned for a series of violent assaults in 2015.\nHe was moved to a female prison after several Conservative MPs spoke out and 150,000 people signed a petition calling for him to be transferred.\nFollowing the case, it was revealed that guidelines pertaining to transgendered people in prison are being rewritten.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/02/06/biologically-male-transgendered-killer-moved-female-prison-sex-inmates/"}
