It is the first time the bowl has sold out the 71,500-seat NRG Stadium in Houston.\n“This has been a transformational year for the AdvoCare V100 Texas Bowl,” said Texas Bowl president Jamey Rootes. “The excitement around our new relationship with the SEC and Big 12 conferences helped us secure well over 60,000 seats before our participating teams were even announced.\n\"Once we knew our matchup, the large and loyal fan bases of the Longhorns and Razorbacks quickly exhausted our ticket supply.\"\nArkansas and Texas were each allotted 10,500 tickets for the game. The Razorbacks had announced they sold out their ticket allotment earlier Thursday. Tickets for the game still remain on the secondary market.\nIt will be the fifth consecutive bowl game Arkansas has played before a capacity crowd.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/dec/18/texas-bowl-sold-out/?page=1"}
