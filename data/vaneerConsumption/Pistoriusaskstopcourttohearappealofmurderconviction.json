Days later, a judge in another court set an April sentencing date. At the time, prosecution spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said the April date would allow the Constitutional Court time to decide whether it would hear Pistorius' appeal.\nPistorius shot Steenkamp through the door of a toilet cubicle in his home early on Valentine's Day 2013. He is currently out on bail and staying at his uncle's mansion in Pretoria.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3394144/Pistorius-asks-court-hear-appeal-murder-conviction.html"}
