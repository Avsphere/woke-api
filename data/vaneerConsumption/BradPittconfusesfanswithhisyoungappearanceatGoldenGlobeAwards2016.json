Brad Pitt looked incredibly youthful at the Golden Globes on Sunday night, shocking viewers of the awards ceremony\nRocking a completely clean-shaven face and a classic swept-back hairstyle, the Hollywood stalwart was as handsome, healthy and glowing as he's ever been.\nThere was barely a line or a wrinkle on his smooth skin, his complexion glowing with vitality - in fact, he could have passed for his co-star Ryan's age, 35.\nSo it's no surprise that eagle-eyed viewers of the live broadcast spotted his remarkable aesthetic, with many in utter shock at his look.\nLeading the way as user @em_nach, who suggested wizardry may be involved, as she wrote: 'I'm just confused at what kind of spell was put on brad pitt that keeps him young looking forever????'\nSpot the difference: The actor, 52, looked fresh-faced and sported the same hairstyle as his much younger self\nMillionaire Matchmaker star David Cruz added: 'What ever potion, lotion or magic witch doctor Brad Pitt is using to look so young, I WANT IT. #GoldenGlobes.'\nA very baffled ‏@foomayzhu questioned the date: 'Is that 2016 Brad Pitt??? Why he look so young??'\n'Omg brad pitt is young again,' commented ‏@_ggoh, while US political writer S. E. Cupp joked: 'Brad Pitt is aging backwards...to a young woman. #GoldenGlobes.'\nWhat the...?? Twitter erupted as fans flooded to the social media site to comment on his young face\nThe tweets kept on coming as more and more people realised Brad's almost unbelievable appearance at the annual awards ceremony.\nUS reality TV star Kat Florek wrote: 'Brad Pitt looks so young tonight ...#GoldenGlobes.'\n'\"Wow, he looks like a young Brad Pitt.\" - us, while looking at Brad Pitt #GoldenGlobes,' wrote the account, ‏@shewantedtoblog.\nIt was also not a shocker that plenty of people drew comparisons to Brad and Benjamin Button, the character he played in the 2009 film.\nChannelling his inner Benjamin Button? Many couldn't help but notice that life seemed to be imitating art for the actor, who famously portrayed Benjamin Button in a film, a man who aged in reverse\n'Wow, Brad Pitt looks young! He's becoming Benjamin Button for real! #goldenglobes2016 #goldenglobes,' added ‏@mannymovies.\n'Brad Pitt looks so young” Benjamin Button tricks..,' said ‏@TysonFREE, while ‏@Champsbutterfly questioned: 'Wait is Brad Pitt doing a Benjamin Button? Waiting for another closeup #GoldenGlobes.'\nIt's fair to say the actor looked far more youthful than he has done in previous years, which have seen him rock a variety of looks.\nComedy duo: Brad appeared on stage with his This Big Short co-star, but all the attention was focused on the 52-year-old\nYounger days: Blessed with natural good looks, baby-faced Brad has long been one of the hottest stars of Hollywood\nHe's sported an array of beards at differing lengths, several different hairstyles and is more often than not seen with a pair of tinted shades on his face when out in public.\nBut it appears the classic floppy haired and stubble-free style is the most flattering on Angelina Jolie's husband, and fans were thrilled to see him back to his best.\nWhile the father-of-six has never admitted to undergoing cosmetic surgery, there have been rumours in the past that he's gone under the knife.\nHandsome double-act: Despite the 17-year age gap between Ryan and Brad, they could have passed for men the same age\nNo wonder he's smiling! The dapper gent's face appeared natural, smooth and inexplicably line-free\nLife imitating art? Brad portrayed a man who aged backwards in 2009's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\nMeanwhile, Brad and Ryan appeared together on stage at the 73rd annual Golden Globes to introduce a clip from their film The Big Short.\nHowever, their bizarre stint together divided opinion as Ryan and Brad acted as a comedy duo, the latter being the bamboozled straight man.\nBrad and Ryan do not actually share any screen time in the biographical dramedy about the financial crisis of 2007–2008, though viewers will surely be hoping they reprise their comedic team at some point in the future.\nBrad, is that you? Back in 2002, at the age of 39, Brad - complete with overly hairy beard - looked far older than he does now\nTime machine: Even in the mid-1990s - at 33 - Brad's facial hair and hairstyle caused him to look older than he does at fresh-faced 52","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3393557/Twitter-erupts-Brad-Pitt-52-confuses-fans-remarkably-ageless-fresh-faced-appearance-Golden-Globes.html"}
