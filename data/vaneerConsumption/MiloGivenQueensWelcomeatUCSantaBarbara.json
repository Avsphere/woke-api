A few students also congregated in a non-disruptive protest outside the venue ahead of the event.\nMilo’s talk can be watched in full below:\nYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at ben@yiannopoulos.net","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/social-justice/2016/05/27/milo-gets-queens-welcome-uc-santa-barbara/"}
