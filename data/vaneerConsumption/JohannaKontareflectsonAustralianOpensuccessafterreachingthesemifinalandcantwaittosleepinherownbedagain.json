I go home to see my parents, spend some time in my own bed. That stays the same.\n'It depends what you view as disappointment. I don't live my life and feel my happiness or joy on my wins and losses.'\nKonta had been hoping to extend Britain's excellent showing in Melbourne, with Andy Murray playing Milos Raonic on Friday in the semi-finals of the singles and Jamie Murray making it through to the doubles final alongside Brazilian Bruno Soares.\nJamie Murray wants to make it third time lucky after he lost with former partner John Peers in the finals at both Wimbledon and the US Open last year.\nHe and Soares, who linked up at the start of this season, will face the experienced duo of Canada's Daniel Nestor and Czech Radek Stepanek on Saturday.\n'I think I know what to expect,' Murray said.\nKerber plays a backhand return to Konta as she secures victory and her place in the final with victory\nGreat Britain's Konta was defeated 7-5, 6-2 by German ace Kerber in Melbourne on Thursday\nKerber (right) shakes hands with Britain's Konta following her semi-final victory on Thursday in Australia\n'Obviously I came up on the wrong side the last two times I was in the final but it wasn't like I played bad matches or anything like that.\n'I fully trust myself that I can perform in those matches. I believe Bruno can as well. I think the mentality we've got and the chemistry we seem to have struck up these last couple of weeks will bode well for us.\n'We'll give it all we've got. We know it's going to be a tough match.'\nWhile Jamie's brother Andy looks to book a Sunday showdown with Novak Djokovic, Britain already has one player into a singles final this weekend after Gordon Reid beat Argentina's Gustavo Fernandez 6-3 6-7 (6/8) 9-7 in the last four of the wheelchair event.\nReid wondered if he would ever play tennis again after contracting Transverse Myelitis - a disease affecting the spinal cord - aged 12 but now the 24-year-old Glaswegian has a shot at a grand slam title.\nBritain already has one player in a singles final this weekend through Gordon Reid in the wheelchair event\nAndy Murray is looking to reach the men's single final by beating Milos Raonic on Friday\nHis brother Jamie is already into the men's doubles Grand Slam final and backs Andy to join him\n'As it turns out, the disease has given me the kind of opportunity I've got today and I'm so thankful for that,' said Reid, who plays Belgium's Joachim Gerard on Saturday.\n'I never would have been in a grand slam final if I wasn't in a wheelchair. I never would have been here in Melbourne sharing the facilities with guys who were my idols growing up, Andy Murray and Roger Federer, guys like that.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-3422209/Johanna-Konta-reflects-Australian-Open-success-reaching-semi-final-t-wait-sleep-bed-again.html"}
