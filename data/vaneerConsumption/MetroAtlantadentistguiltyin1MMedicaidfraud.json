Also, some claims listed Solarin as the treating dentist on days she was not in the country.\nThe false claims were submitted from 2009 to 2013, Horn said.\n“I am proud of the collaborative efforts that led to this successful prosecution,” Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said. “The Georgia Department of Law stands ready to work with our federal and local partners to ensure that those who participate in criminal activity are brought to justice, particularly when that activity jeopardizes the medical care of those who are truly in need and wastes taxpayer dollars.”\nSolarin used most of the $996,862.19 gained from the scheme to buy real estate in the Atlanta area, Horn said. As part of the plea deal, she has agreed to repay the money and will forfeit her interest in over a dozen real estate properties.\nSentencing is set for Feb. 3 on charges of conspiring to commit healthcare fraud.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/metro-atlanta-dentist-guilty-medicaid-fraud/oVGzklmWhBsIsflbUyPsqK/"}
