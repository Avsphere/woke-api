Loyalty programs have proved to be major drivers for QSRs. For context, Starbucks rewards and loyalty program has 12 million active members, Among those, 8 million pay via mobile, and roughly 4 million use Starbucks' mobile order-ahead feature. And they do so regularly — in Q3 2016, over one in four US Starbucks transactions came from its mobile app. Alienating these consumers could potentially lead to significant lose for KFC.\nLoyalty programs have proved to be major drivers for QSRs.

Security issues could hinder some of the digital momentum KFC has built with its consumers. KFC has been aggressive in growing its digital offerings, which include accepting mobile payments through Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay, as well as a mobile order-ahead feature in partnership with AIRTAG and PayPal in the UK. However, if consumers in and outside the UK don't trust that their information is secure, its unlikely they would be willing to adopt these digital features or future ones.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/kfcs-uk-loyalty-program-has-been-hacked-2016-12"}
