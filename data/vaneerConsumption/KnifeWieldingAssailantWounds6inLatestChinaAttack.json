The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nBEIJING - A knife-wielding assailant wounded six people on Tuesday in an attack at a railway station in China's southern city of Guangzhou, police and state media said, the latest in a series of assaults to raise jitters around the country.\nPolice gave no reason for the attack, but China has grown increasingly nervous about Islamic militancy since a car burst into flames on the edge of Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October and 29 people were stabbed to death in March in the southwestern city of Kunming.\nThe government blamed militants from the restive far western region of Xinjiang for both those attacks. Resource-rich and strategically located Xinjiang, on the borders of central Asia, has for years been beset by violence blamed by the Chinese government on Islamist militants.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/knife-wielding-assailant-wounds-6-latest-china-attack-n98041"}
