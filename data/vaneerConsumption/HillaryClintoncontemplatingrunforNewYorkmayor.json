Last week, a poll of likely US voters showed that a majority donâ€™t want Clinton to run for mayor.\nRasmussen Reports released a poll showing that 58 per cent of likely US voters don't want to see Hillary on the ballot. Twenty-three percent of respondents said Hillary should run and 19 per cent weren't sure.\nThe poll was conducted over the phone and online on March 2 and 5, and surveyed 1,000 likely voters around the US.\nDe Blasio, a Democrat, has said he plans to seek reelection.\nThe incumbent, Mayor Bill de Blasio (above), a Democrat, has said that he plans to seek re-election\nHis Republican challengers include Paul Massey, Jr., Rev. Michael Faulkner and former NYPD Detective Richard 'Bo' Dietl.\nWhen rumors first started circulating in January about a possible Hillary run in New York, a Quinnipiac University poll showed that De Blasio would lose to his friend in a head-to-head race, 49 to 30 per cent.\nHe would lose to Hillary particularly badly among Democrats, 61 to 30 per cent, but would hypothetically beat her among State Island residents and Republicans.\nThat poll said he would beat every other potential candidate, including city comptroller Scott Stringer, former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, and Sen. Tony Avella from Queens.\nThe next election for the mayor of New York is scheduled for November 7, 2017.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4318520/Hillary-Clinton-contemplating-run-New-York-mayor.html"}
