I thought I’d got a drink on the side everything kind of went a little foggy, I started feeling sick to my stomach and just dizzy.\nShe says Cosby then escorted her to one of the bedrooms in the mansion so she could get some rest, but she doesn’t remember making it there.\nHer next memory was waking up “butt naked” with Cosby partially clothed and pleasuring himself above her.\n“I came to and remember seeing this big man crouched over me. It was Bill Cosby, and he was at my feet, kind of licking and kissing them and I think he bit my toe as that’s what woke me up,” Goins said.\nGoins claims Cosby then jumped up, pulled up his pants and left the room.\nShe believes he groped her body and licked her breasts.\nThe woman plans to make a full statement to Los Angeles police, according to The Daily Mail.\nThe woman joins at least 20 others, who have made similar claims against the iconic family-friendly comic.\nBoth Cosby, and his wife Camille broke their silence this week in separate statements, denying the allegations.\nCamille Cosby questioned the media’s handling of the accusations. “There appears to be no vetting of my husband’s accusers before stories are published or aired,” she said. “An accusation is published, and immediately goes viral.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2014/12/16/young-woman-claims-bill-cosby-drugged-her-licked-her-toes/"}
