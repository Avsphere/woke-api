She is seen desperately clinging to the door handle while her mom runs to her rescue.\nGardner tells WJW-TV (http://bit.ly/2mInb4K ) that Madison held on to the door handle until she came to take her down. She says her little girl \"is totally OK.\"\nThe mom had some fun with it, setting her Facebook video to the tune of Frank Sinatra's \"Come Fly With Me.\" It had been viewed more than 300,000 times as of early Friday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4300870/4-year-old-takes-flight-amid-high-winds-Cleveland-area.html"}
