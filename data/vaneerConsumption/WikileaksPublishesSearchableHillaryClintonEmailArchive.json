This act was a direct violation of normal federal government record-keeping procedures at the Department of State and became a more severe offense when it was revealed that Clinton’s server contained nearly 2,100 e-mails that were officially marked classified.\nAlthough Clinton has maintained that the purpose of the server was strictly “a matter of convenience,” the FBI has started an investigation to determine if her use of the private server to transmit classified information is unlawful. According to the investigation, “more than 26 percent of them contained information that the government now deems classified or secret.”\nThe email archive is already shedding more light on the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the US compound in Benghazi and its aftermath, including revealing that Clinton worked with Google and Youtube to block access to the independent film she claimed was responsible for the 2012 Benghazi attacks.\nSubject: RE: Google and YouTube Sue just called back and theblockwill staythroughMonday [sic]. They will not/not be unblocking it before then.\nNora Toiv\nOffice of the Secretary\nThe e-mails, which have been released over time by the State Department, are easily navigated with the Wikileaks tool which has provided increased accessibility. The increased awareness of this issue may put her campaign at risk, as those on both the right and left have taken to scouring the over 50,000 pages from Clinton’s private server for incriminating details.\nTom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart Tech.
