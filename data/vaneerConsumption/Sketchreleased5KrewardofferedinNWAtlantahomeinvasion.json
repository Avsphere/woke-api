The teens tried to force their way into the home and shot Lash twice — once in each leg — as he tried to stop them.\nShots were also fired at Whitney Lash as she ran from the home with the couple’s 6-month-old baby, but both were unharmed.\nPolice said several suspects then ransacked the family’s home.\nAtlanta police also released Wednesday video footage from a surveillance camera at a business across the street from the Lashes’ home. Several small, indistinguishable figures can be seen walking down the street toward the home and, a few minutes later, running in the opposite direction.\nNo arrests have been made in the case.\nAccording to posts on an online fundraiser established for the family, Michael Lash remained hospitalized Wednesday following surgery to insert a rod in one of his legs.\n“One of his legs is doing very well because the bullet passed thru that thigh without hitting bone or artery,” Lash’s father-in-law wrote. “He has some serious nerve damage in the other leg which will require many months of physical therapy. Mike should be released from Grady this week and he and his family will be living with Jessica and me in Vinings while we sort things out.”\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, more than $70,000 in donations had been made to the fundraising page.\nAnyone with information in the case is asked to contact Crime Stoppers by calling 404-577-TIPS, visiting crimestoppersatlanta.org, or texting CSA and the tip to 274637. Tipsters can remain anonymous.\nA $5,000 reward is being offered.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/sketch-released-reward-offered-atlanta-home-invasion/9owRUO2Nlom6CUeJxLRpQM/"}
