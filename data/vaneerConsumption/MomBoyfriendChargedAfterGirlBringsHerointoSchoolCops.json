The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe mother of a 6-year-old girl and her boyfriend face charges after the girl allegedly brought heroin to her Philadelphia elementary school.\nThe woman, who has not yet been identified, was questioned by police on Tuesday while her home was searched. Early Wednesday, officials announced she was charged in connection to the drugs.\nTuesday morning, the woman's 6-year-old daughter brought 11 packs of heroin to Barry Elementary School in the city's Cobbs Creek section, according to school officials. Police say two of the packs were open.\n\"We know that one of the packages clearly looks like it was bitten,\" said Philadelphia Police Lt. John Walker.\nInvestigators say the girl showed the heroin to her classmates. Teachers then took immediate action when they noticed the commotion.\n\"Their teacher did a remarkable job,\" Walker said. \"They saw the child with these items. The teacher recognized right away, took control and notified another teacher.\"\nThe teacher evacuated the class and 20 students, including the girl who allegedly brought the drugs, were taken to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia as a precaution.\n\"The only person who we're sure had contact with the product at this point was the young female that brought it in,\" said Philadelphia Police Cpt. John Przepiorka. \"The young girl that brought it in did feel a little dizzy and didn't feel well. So we sent her over to CHOP to make sure she's okay.\"\nAll 20 children were evaluated and released. Aside from the girl feeling ill, police say no injuries were reported.\nThe 6-year-old girl's mother as well as her boyfriend were taken into custody and a search warrant was served at her home in the Parkside section of the city. Investigators say conditions inside the house are filthy and that they found drugs inside.\nThe mother remained in police custody Wednesday. Both the girl and her three siblings will be cared for by DHS officials.\nTamika Gore, a relative of the young girl, spoke to NBC10.\n\"She probably found it,\" Gore said. \"I have no idea. I know it ain't come from her house. I know that for a fact.\"\nA letter was also sent home to parents stating that an illegal substance was found on a child.\n\"This school is crazy,\" said Ayana Hales, a parent of students at Barry Elementary. \"My kids, I want them out of here.\"\nOfficials with the Philadelphia School District say the school's principal and teacher followed protocol and correctly handled the situation.\n- NBC 10 Philadelphia","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mom-boyfriend-charged-after-girl-brings-heroin-school-cops-n128251"}
