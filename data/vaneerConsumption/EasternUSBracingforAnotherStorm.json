The storm will also send Boston and other eastern cities into yet another deep freeze.\nThe National Weather Service reports that the new system is cutting a 2,000 mile path from southern Missouri to Maine and will slam parts of southern Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.\nThere will be frozen rain and possible flooding in Kentucky and Tennessee from a weather system that has been spreading life threatening cold.\nNearly 50 people have died from Chicago to Maine over the last few weeks as the bitter cold and constant snow fall has taken its toll. Eighteen have died in Tennessee alone.\nAlso, since Monday ten have died in Kentucky from weather-related causes.\nThis life threatening cold has also been breaking records set in the early years of the last century across much of the country.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/02/22/eastern-us-bracing-for-another-storm/"}
