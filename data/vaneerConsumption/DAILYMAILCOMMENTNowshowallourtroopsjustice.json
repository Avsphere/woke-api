Neither did legions of our readers from every walk of life, military and civilian, who contributed sums large and small to raise £800,000 for Sgt Blackman’s appeal.\nInstead, we saw a soldier with an exemplary record, who had cracked under unimaginable stress on the battlefield and committed an atrocity quite out of character, before being hung out to dry.\nIndeed, the top brass behaved nothing short of contemptibly in seeking to cover up their incompetence and leadership failings – even suppressing a report on mitigating factors and stopping an officer from giving evidence for the defence.\nWe never condoned Sgt Blackman’s action. But like his brave, loyal wife Claire, we felt a terrible wrong had been done to him at his court martial. At very least, his conviction should be reduced to manslaughter.\nYesterday, the Court Martial Appeal Court agreed. Justice at last!\nYet the five judges’ unanimous decision – and, we pray, Sgt Blackman’s early release – cannot end the matter. For during the three and a half years the former marine has been behind bars, the legal hounding of troops has continued apace.\nThis is in spite of the fact that ambulance-chasing human rights lawyers have been exposed as crooks, with the firm behind trumped-up charges against hundreds of servicemen shutting down, and its bent founder Phil Shiner struck off.\nMeanwhile, the blow to morale has caused a sharp dip in Army recruitment and thousands of servicemen are retiring early.\nAs we celebrate justice for Sgt Blackman, therefore, ministers must urgently review the military covenant to ensure heroes who risk all for us are treated fairly in return.\nYes, we still demand the highest standards of our soldiers. But in the name of sanity and justice, never again should a momentary lapse of judgment in the heat of battle be treated as calculated murder.\nLearn from this fiasco\nNot his finest hour: Philip Hammond was forced into a cringeing U-turn\nNo soft soap or flannel can wipe away the truth that the U-turn over National Insurance has been a humiliating fiasco.\nIndeed, it is baffling that neither Philip Hammond, nor those around him, foresaw trouble over breaking a key manifesto pledge and betraying the Tories’ enterprising, self-reliant, self-employed core supporters.\nAs for claiming the pledge not to increase NI referred only to Class 1 contributions, this was an insult to the intelligence.\nNor can No 10 escape censure for nodding the measure through – though this paper suspects all credit for yesterday’s U-turn belongs to Theresa May, not the ‘desiccated calculating machine’ (to borrow a jibe from Nye Bevan) at No 11.\nAfter all, Downing Street can’t claim it wasn’t warned. The day before the Budget, this column cautioned strongly against tinkering with NI.\nWhat matters now is that ministers should learn from the mistake, replacing crass advisers and never again forgetting the strivers they swore to help.\nAs for the £2billion fiscal hole left by the U-turn, may the Mail gently point out it could be filled many times over by diverting cash from overseas aid? Now, that would be one breach of a manifesto pledge the country would gladly forgive.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-4318554/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-troops-justice.html"}
