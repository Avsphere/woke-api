The usually fiery red volcanic flow was changed to blue thanks to a natural phenomenon known to locals as 'blue hour'.

Kilauea has been erupting ever since its birth, according to scientists\nKILAUEA VOLCANO The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii formed 300,000-600,000 years ago. And, it has been active ever since, according to the US Geological Survey. It erupts from three main areas, the summit and two rift zones, and most of these events are 'relatively gentle.' 'Every few decades to centuries, however, powerful explosions spread ejecta across the landscape,' according to the USGS's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. 'Such explosions can be lethal, as the one in 1790 that killed scores of people in a war party near the summit of Kilauea.'\nThe series of images capture the natural phenomena in eye-wateringly close detail.\nWhile the lava flow stopped momentarily after a portion of cliff collapsed, the hose re-emerged on the 4 February.\n'Killer show this afternoon for our 3:30pm 2/4/17 Lava Boat Tour,' Kalapana Cultural-Tours wrote on Facebook.\n'Light variable winds made lava viewing pretty epic from the southern vantage point. Guests were surprised to see the lava fire hose still active.'\nJust before the dramatic collapse, the firehose was 'no longer visible,' according to the USGS's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\nBut a video from Kalapana Cultural Tours revealed it persisted.\nStunning footage captured in the early morning shows the bright stream pouring into the ocean once again.\n'Southwest winds made viewing from the south perfect,' the group wrote on Facebook.\nIt's thought that the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii formed anywhere from 300,000-600,000 years ago. It can be found on the south side of the Big Island\nStunning new images have emerged of the phenomenon, taken by a Jon Cornforth, a Hawaiian photograph, while standing just metres from the lava\nThe incredible photos were taken at the end of January by Jon Cornforth, a Hawaiian photographer, using a Sony A7R2 camera\n'Pele is still pouring into the Pacific Ocean. Fire hose lava entry is still visible.'\nThe video ends with what appears to be a large explosion.\nWhen the molten lava hits the cool seawater, it reacts and causes explosions that can throw large chunks of hot rock and debris inland, where tourists hike in to see the lava, and seaward, where tour boats cruise the shoreline.\nThe gases released from the reaction are also dangerous to breathe, and shards of volcanic glass can be thrown into the air when the hot lava meets the cool seawater.\nA section of sea cliff above the massive 'firehose' lava flow on Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano collapsed and splashed into the ocean as tourists and geologists watched.\nA large crack in the section of cliff above the gushing molten lava stream gave way as scientists stood just yards away.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4301092/Hawaii-Kilauea-volcano-spews-blue-lava.html"}
