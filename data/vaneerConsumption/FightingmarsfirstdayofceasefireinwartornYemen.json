It’s meant to give Yemen’s warring sides time to prepare for U.N.-sponsored peace talks, scheduled to take place in Kuwait on April 18.\nResidents of Taiz, which has been besieged by the rebels for over a year, are blaming the Houthis for the overnight random shelling that killed one civilian and wounded four. They spoke Monday on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.\nThe Saudi-led coalition has said it will commit to the open-ended cease-fire and halt its yearlong air campaign against the rebels.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/news/fighting-mars-first-day-of-cease-fire-in-war-torn-yemen/"}
