We don't use a convoluted mathematical or artificial intelligence model, but instead have regular people representing the broad spectrum of Americans blindly rate the bias of articles. That produces a fair, verifiable bias rating.\nThis media bias rating was determined using the following levels of bias verification.\nBasis of Rating: Blind Survey\nThird Party Data Wikipedia\n0 Community Feedback\n0 Editorial Review\n1 Secondary Research\nConfidence Level: Medium\nUnless otherwise noted, this bias rating refers only to news articles on their web site, not from opinion pieces or what is broadcasted on TV or radio.
