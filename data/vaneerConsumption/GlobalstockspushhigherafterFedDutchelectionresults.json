London's FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent to 7,410.

The move was widely expected. The central bank stressed that it plans to move gradually and stuck to its projection that it will raise rates a total of three times this year. That cooled speculation among some investors that the Fed could move more aggressively.\nA currency trader walks by the screen showing the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) at the foreign exchange dealing room in Seoul, South Korea, in Seoul, South Korea, Thursday, March 16, 2017.

Following Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president, \"the Netherlands said, 'Whoa!' to the wrong kind of populism,\" said Rutte. Wilders campaigned on pledges to close borders to migrants from Muslim nations, close mosques, ban the Quran and take the Netherlands out of the EU.\nANALYST TAKE: \"Global equities are handsomely positive, risk appetite revived by a Fed update that was less hawkish than it could have been, further policy tightening likely gradual,\" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. \"Relief from the Dutch election result is also supporting sentiment.\"\nASIA'S DAY: Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.1 percent to 19,590.14 and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.8 percent to 3,268.94.

The Fed chair had reiterated that the committee expects a 'gradual increase' in rates on the back of evolving economic conditions and monetary policy 'remains accommodative' at present.\"\nCHINA FOLLOWS THE FED: China's central bank raised a short-term interest rate on lending to banks but left its benchmark rate unchanged following the U.S. increase.
