Insiders say Brin decided to build his airship around three years ago after regularly visiting the Nasa Ames Research Centre in Silicon Valley. Engineers have already finished the frame of the craft which looks like a zeppelin. Sources say that Brin was inspired by old photos of the USS Macon, a lighter-than-air rigid airship that was the Navy's last flying aircraft carrier, used in the 1930s.\nBrin has been building the airship inside Hangar 2 at the Nasa Ames Research Centre in Silicon Valley, according to a new Bloomberg report.\nInsiders say Brin decided to build his airship around three years ago after visiting Ames regularly.\nThe craft takes up much of the vast hangar where it is being built.\n'Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now', Brin wrote in an email when asked for comment by Bloomberg.\nAlan Weston, who previously led Nasa's Ames programmes is leading the project and has spoken about the possibility of airships carrying freight.\n'New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude', he said in a 2013 interview.\n'A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but thereâ€™s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck', he added.\nWith these airships the overall lift of the vehicle is equivalent to the weight of air displaced by the helium.\n'And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has', said Mr Weston, who did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comment.\nSources say that Brin was inspired by old photos of the USS Macon, a lighter-than-air rigid airship that was the Navy's last flying aircraft carrier, used in the 1930s. It was operated by the US Navy and served as a 'flying aircraft carrier'\nTHE USS MACON The USS Macon crashed off the coast of California eighty years ago. The Macon was operated by the US Navy and served as a 'flying aircraft carrier,' designed to carry five biplanes for scouting and training. It was returning to Mountain View, California in February 1935 when it ran into a storm off Point Sur. Wind shear caused structural damage, puncturing gas cells and then a leak. The damage meant the 785-foot airship gently floated down into Monterey Bay off Point Sur in California, taking around 20 minutes to settle.\nSources say that Brin was inspired by old photos of the USS Macon, a lighter-than-air rigid airship that was the Navy's last flying aircraft carrier, used in the 1930s.\nThe airship crashed off the coast of California eighty years ago when it was caught in a storm over Port Sur, California, killing two crew members.\nThe Macon was operated by the US Navy and served as a 'flying aircraft carrier,' designed to carry five biplanes for scouting and training.\nThe dirigible had been damaged in a previous incident in the mountains above Arizona.\nIt was returning to Mountain View, California in February 1935 when it ran into a storm off Point Sur.\nWind shear caused structural damage, puncturing gas cells and then a leak.\nThe damage meant the 785-foot airship gently floated down into Monterey Bay off Point Sur in California, taking around 20 minutes to settle.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4446864/Google-founder-Sergey-Brin-building-giant-AIRSHIP.html"}
