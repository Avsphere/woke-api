John Lewis has just been confirmed for Saturday’s protest rally in Woodruff Park, upping the event’s profile on the eve of Donald Trump’s visit Friday to the city.\nThe civil rights icon famously traded barbs with Trump on Twitter earlier this year about Lewis’ accomplishments as well as the state of the congressman’s district -- the very district the convention is being held in.\nORIGINAL STORY: At least several hundred gun control advocates are expected to gather Friday and Saturday in downtown Atlanta to protest the National Rifle Association’s annual convention this weekend.\nOn Friday, as President Donald Trump plans to address the NRA gathering midday at the Georgia World Congress Center, more than 300 people have RSVP’d on social media to attend a 11:30 a.m. “die-in” several blocks away in Woodruff Park.\nThe NRA is a powerful political advocate for gun rights and formidable opponent of gun control laws. (www.accessatlanta.com)\nAt the same time, other protesters are expected to gather at Centennial Olympic Park, which is much closer to the convention site.\nThen on Saturday, national advocates backed by Everytown for Gun Safety are planning a, 11 a.m. rally at Woodruff Park. Organizers say they have received at least 1,000 RSVP’s for the event, which will include both local and national activists.\nMore than 80,000 people are expected to attend the convention, which is the NRA’s showcase event for the year and also features hundreds of exhibitors.\nTrump, whose visit marks the first time since Ronald Reagan that a sitting president has attended the convention, is also expected to attend a fund-raiser for 6th Congressional District candidate Karen Handel Friday afternoon.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/john-lewis-joins-saturday-protest-trump-heads-atlanta-for-nra-convention/0s4DjhsQ4BOsl8DjpS0R2O/"}
