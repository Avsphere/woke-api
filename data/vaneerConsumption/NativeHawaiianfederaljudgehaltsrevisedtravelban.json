Hours before it was to take effect, President Donald Trump's revised travel ban was put on hold Wednesday, March 15, 2017, by Watson, a federal judge in Hawaii who questioned whether the administration was motivated by national security concerns. (George Lee/The Star-Advertiser via AP)\nWatson isn't fixated on being a Native Hawaiian jurist, said Keith Lee, corporate counsel for the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center.\nThe judge is a play-by-the-book kind of man and isn't influenced by politics, Lee said.\nLee first got to know Watson in 2012- the soon-to-be judge was still an assistant U.S. attorney- while they worked on a settlement together. \"He was super fair,\" Lee said.\nThey crossed paths again at a Washington D.C. conference for the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.\n\"He doesn't have a big ego,\" Lee said. \"If anything, he's kind of understated.\"\nHonolulu lawyers refer to Watson as a \"double Harvard\" for where he received his undergraduate education in 1988 and his law degree in 1991.\nBut his roots are in Hawaii, where he attended a private school that gives admission preference to Native Hawaiians.\n\"I am proud to welcome this Kamehameha Schools graduate to serve in such a prestigious capacity,\" U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said when Watson was confirmed.\nHonolulu defense attorney Michael Green has had numerous cases before Watson. \"The man is extremely strict and principled,\" Green said.\nThat strictness was evident during a sex assault trial last year, which Watson tried to keep on a tight schedule, Green said. But when Green's wife suffered a stroke during the trial, Watson showed kindness. \"He slowed the trial down so I could be there for closing argument and to finish my examination of key witnesses,\" Green said. \"He can be deemed a very tough sentencer. If you look between the lines, there's compassion.\"\nWhile at the U.S. attorney's office in Hawaii Watson was chief of the civil division. Before that he was partner at a San Francisco firm, where he focused on product liability, toxic tort, and environmental cost recovery litigation, according to his biography posted on the Honolulu federal court's website.\nWatson was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Northern District of California from 1995 to 2000, including serving as deputy chief of the civil division from 1999 to 2000, the bio said.\n\"The only thing I don't like about him is that he's a hardcore Dodger's fan,\" Lee said with a laugh.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4318740/Native-Hawaiian-federal-judge-halts-revised-travel-ban.html"}
