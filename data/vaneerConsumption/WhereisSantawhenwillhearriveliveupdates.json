And since he travels \"faster than starlight,\" it's impossible for NORAD to post every single location.\nHowever, here's what we do know, per NORAD:\n·In 2016, he was seen stopped in Macon, Georgia at 10:17 p.m. and was heading north.\n·He usually stops in most cities between 9 and 11 p.m. local time.\n·Historically, Santa visits the South Pacific first, then moves up and down across the Eastern, then the Western hemispheres. (He usually starts at the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean and travels west.)\n·NORAD coordinates with Santa’s Elf Launch staff to confirm his launch time, but Santa calls the shots after that.\n(www.austin360.com)\nNow, here's how to track Santa through NORAD:\n·Use the multilingual website.\n[...] ·Download official NORAD Tracks Santa apps, available in Apple and Google Play stores\n·Follow him on social media through Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.\n·Speak with a live phone operator by dialing the toll-free number 1-877-Hi-NORAD (1-877-446-6723) or by sending an email tonoradtrackssanta@outlook.com\n·OnStar subscribers can press the OnStar button in their vehicles to locate Santa. Bing and Cortana users can also find Santa's location.\n·Ask for Santa’s location through the NORAD Tracks Santa skill for Amazon Alexa.\nSee more information here.\nFinally, should you want a second option, there's also the Google Santa Tracker.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/tracking-santa-when-will-near-your-house-christmas-eve/DvO23LFqIQiTAFmTRgBXEL/"}
