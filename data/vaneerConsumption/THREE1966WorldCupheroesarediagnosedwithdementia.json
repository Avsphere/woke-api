It's not going to get any better, it's only going to deteriorate.'\nThe pair, speaking in London, laughed and joked with each other as Sir Geoff admitted: 'You never lose that dressing room banter.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4448124/THREE-1966-world-cup-heroes-diagnosed-dementia.html"}
