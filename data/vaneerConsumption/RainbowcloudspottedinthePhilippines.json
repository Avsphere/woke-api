It looks like a unicorn is coming.'\n'It was amazing. It looked like a magical kind of phenomenon. I've never seen anything like it before.'\nAnne Salikala, 21, spotted the rare rainbow cloud phenomenon. She thought it looked like a unicorn. 'I've never seen anything like it before'\n'It wasn't in the sky for long. So I was lucky to be able to record it. Certainly, it has made a lot of people happy to look at it.'\nThe stunning rainbow is believed to have formed from a combination of the humidity, heat, and tiny droplets of water suspended around the cloud.\nSuch 'cloud iridescence' happens when tiny frozen water droplets in the clouds are hit by sunlight at just the right angle to form a rainbow of colors.\nThe phenomenon is called cloud iridescence or irisation. The term comes from Iris, the Greek personification of rainbow.\nCloud iridescence is a fairly uncommon phenomenon.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447674/Rare-rainbow-cloud-spotted-Philippines.html"}
