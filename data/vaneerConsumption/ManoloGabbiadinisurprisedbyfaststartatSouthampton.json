'I am in a completely different style of football and everything is different here, from the city to my team-mates. I didn't think this would happen.\n'I have to thank all my team-mates and the coach, who have been extraordinary and really helped me. The important thing is to give my all to make the fans happy.'\nEven though Gabbiadini only made 13 appearances for Napoli this season, the majority of them came out of position.\nGabbiadini thought it would take longer to adapt to the style of football in England\nGABBIADINI'S NAPOLI 2016-17 STATS Appearances - 13 | Goals - 3 Shot accuracy - 74 per cent Pass accuracy - 70 per cent *All stats from Serie A only*\nAnd the Â£17million-man admitted he was left feeling low after a lack of game-time in Italy.\n'I could not carry on like that,' he said. 'I finished games and came home and felt really sad, because I didn't feel that I was involved, it was a bad feeling.\n'When I left, I told myself that I had to start over and I had to prove to myself that I was still capable of playing. Waiting six months would have been really hard.'\nSouthampton's next game sees them travel to Tottenham Hotspur on March 19.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4300346/Manolo-Gabbiadini-surprised-fast-start-Southampton.html"}
