It would allow the Department of Correction to either use a barbiturate or a combination of three drugs for executions. The agency would also be barred from releasing who makes or supplies the drugs.\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court last week ruled the state's existing lethal injection law is constitutional. The state hasn't executed anyone since 2005, and has 33 inmates on death row.\nThe bill could be considered by the House as early as Wednesday.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/mar/24/house-panel-endorses-bill-restart-executions/?page=1"}
