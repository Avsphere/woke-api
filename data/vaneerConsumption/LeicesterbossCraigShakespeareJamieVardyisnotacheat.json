They were winning 2-0, play the game like a man.”\nBut Shakespeare responded by backing his man.\nHe said: “Jamie’s not a cheat and never has been, never will be. I think Jamie responded well to the comment and we have to put it to bed. The game has gone, the referee made his decision and we have to move on.”\nVardy, who has nine goals to his name this season, has been included in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for this month’s friendly against Germany and World Cup qualifier against Lithuania.\nHere it is – the #ThreeLions squad for this month's games against 🇩🇪 and 🇱🇹! pic.twitter.com/CpSFOmRwyQ — England (@England) March 16, 2017\nHe has scored three times in his last four games, having netted just three goals in the previous 26 games – a hat-trick against Manchester City – but Shakespeare was never worried by the striker’s dry stint.\n“Tell me a forward who hasn’t gone through that spell,” the Foxes boss said. “It happens. With Jamie’s reaction, you could see the joy in terms of the first goal he got. Strikers live and die by their goals but the overall performance of forwards is vitally important.\n“There are some good ones (strikers) and he is proven in terms of being in the (England) squad before so he’s up there with the rest of them.”\nLeicester go to West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday as the last remaining British club in the Champions League after Manchester City’s exit to Monaco but, ahead of Friday’s draw for the last eight, Shakespeare is not concerned by that tag.\nHe added: “My thoughts aren’t about that. It’s about the fact we put in a performance Tuesday and that’s our aim. Looking forward, we have to make sure we’re competitive, but every game we go into, we try to get a result.”\nDefensive midfielder Nampalys Mendy is rated 50-50 for the trip to the London Stadium having returned to training this week following a knee injury.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4320882/Leicester-boss-Craig-Shakespeare-Jamie-Vardy-not-cheat.html"}
