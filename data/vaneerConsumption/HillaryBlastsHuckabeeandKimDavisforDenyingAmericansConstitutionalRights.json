Mike Huckabee (R-AR) and Kentucky clerk Kim Davis for denying Americans their constitutional rights.\nClinton said, “I wish that all the progress that we’ve made was so secure and so deeply-ingrained in our laws and values that we didn’t have to keep constantly defending it but we’re not there yet. There are still public officials doing everything in their power to interfere with your rights. There are still too many places where lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans are targeted for harassment and violence. There are still too many young people out there feeling hopeless and alone now we reassure them it gets better but that can be hard to believe when you turn on the TV and see a Republican candidate for president literally standing in the courthouse door in Kentucky calling for people to join him in resisting a Supreme Court ruling, celebrating a county clerk who’s breaking the law by denying other Americans their constitutional rights.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/04/hillary-blasts-huckabee-and-kim-davis-for-denying-americans-constitutional-rights/"}
