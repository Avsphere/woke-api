Castleford, too, are guaranteed to be pushing for a top-four spot under the shrewd guidance of Daryl Powell.\nThe biggest improvers could be Catalans Dragons, who have made a host of exciting signings and are still hoping to lure the controversial Willie Mason to the south of France.\nThe departure of experienced players Scott Dureau, Elliott Whitehead, Benjamin Garcia, Ian Henderson, Zeb Taia and Michael Oldfield left huge holes but the Dragons appear to have more than adequately filled them with the likes of Richie Myler, Dave Taylor, Glenn Stewart, Pat Richards, Justin Horo, Paul Aiton and Jodie Broughton, with or without Mason who is trying to obtain the necessary paperwork to make the move.\nHull, too, have high hopes after some impressive recruitment but it could be a long, hard season for city rivals Hull KR, who will be desperately hoping that skipper Terry Campese can stay fit for the duration this time.\nSalford and Widnes have prospered in pre-season friendlies but they look sure to be involved in another scrap near the foot of the table, along with Wakefield who had to battle it out in the Â£1million game to ensure their survival in 2015.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-3423120/Super-League-XXI-Preview-Leeds-Rhinos-look-mount-title-defence-despite-loss-inspirational-leaders.html"}
