The final total is expected to be roughly double the initial $140 million price tag, mostly because of interest over the next two decades.\nCleveland's share is an estimated $88 million over 11 years, starting in 2024. Mayor Frank Jackson signed off on that Tuesday.\nThe county already approved the deal and agreed to sell bonds for the project.\nThe team committed to extend its lease at the arena to 2034.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4447624/Cleveland-OKs-chunk-financing-upgrade-Cavs-arena.html"}
