The growth will be partly driven by the revenue from the first season of the Premier League's new broadcast deals that include NBC, he said.\nAccording to Deloitte, the 7-percent increase in Premier League revenue is the largest absolute growth of any of the \"big five\" European leagues. German clubs generated $2.85 billion, while those in Spain reaped $2.68 billion, Italy's clubs garnered $2.35 billion and French clubs saw revenues of $1.84 billion.\nThe majority of the Premier League revenue's growth arose from commercial sources, with the two Manchester clubs accounting for over half of the league's commercial revenue increase. United won the title in 2012-13 and City were the latest champion.\nBy comparison, Major League Baseball brought in more than $8 billion in gross revenue last season, according to Forbes. But MLB has 30 clubs, compared to the Premier League's 20.\n- The Associated Press.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/world-cup/we-are-champions-premier-league-tops-world-soccer-revenue-n123521"}
