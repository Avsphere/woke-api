They have been in jail without bond since last month, after an indictment came down charging them with child cruelty and felony murder.\nAmir Ross died after injuries authorities believe he sustained between May 9 to 31, 2016, the indictment said. The boy, whose great aunt said he faced myriad developmental issues and had a feeding tube, was weeks away from turning two on July 10.\nHis parents were arrested on June 3, 2016, on child cruelty charges but were released on bond within that month.\nThey stayed free until authorities re-arrested them on the new charges of felony murder early last month.\nFacing a murder charge makes it generally more difficult, but not impossible, to get bond in DeKalb.\nREAD: In Fulton and DeKalb, dozens of murder suspects out on bond\nREAD: How long will DeKalb dad get for drowning autistic son, 10?\nREAD: Oxygen channel airs show on time DeKalb’s sheriff had a rival killed\nThe mother’s aunt, Rochelle Evans, who lives in Chicago, Illinois, said she couldn’t believe either parent killed the boy.\n“On my mother,” Evans, whose mom recently died, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “she did not kill her baby and neither did Eric.”\nIt isn’t clear when hearings will take place to decide the motions for bond.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter\nIn other news:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/dekalb-parents-charged-with-toddler-death-want-out-jail-bond/rj870Yjx5JFx8LESZhDDYK/"}
