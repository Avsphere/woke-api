(AP) — In one of the most competitive categories of the year, it was Brie Larson who walked away with the Golden Globe award for best actress in a drama on Sunday for her work in \"Room.\"\nIn the film directed by Lenny Abrahamson and adapted from Emma Donoghue's novel, Larson plays Ma, a woman living in captivity with her young son who was fathered by her captor.\nOn stage, Larson gave a heartfelt speech thanking Donoghue, Abrahamson, and her young co-star Jacob Tremblay.\nBrie Larson arrives at the 73rd annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, Jan. 10, 2016, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif.

She was up against awards favorites Saoirse Ronan for \"Brooklyn\" and Cate Blanchett for \"Carol.\" Other nominees were Rooney Mara (\"Carol\") and Alicia Vikander (\"The Danish Girl\"). Vikander was also nominated in the supporting actress category for \"Ex Machina,\" but lost out to Kate Winslet who won for \"Steve Jobs.\"\nMany of the Globes' dramatic nominees, especially Ronan, Blanchett, and Larson, are considered locks for an Academy Award nomination too. Oscar nominations will be revealed on Thursday.\nJulianne Moore won last year for her portrayal of a woman living with early onset Alzheimer's Disease in \"Still Alice\" and went on to win the best actress Oscar, too.\nCate Blanchett arrives at the 73rd annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, Jan. 10, 2016, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif.
