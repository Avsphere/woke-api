I’ve sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before.\n“The client who bought Simon is very famous. He’s upset.”\nThe breed costs £5,000 a year to keep, the paper said.\nA United Airlines plane\nA United spokeswoman said: “We were saddened to hear this news. The safety and wellbeing of all the animals that travel with us is of the utmost importance to United Airlines and our PetSafe team.\n“We have been in contact with our customer and have offered assistance. We are reviewing this matter.”\nIt comes less than three weeks after a video showing passenger David Dao being dragged off a United Express flight sparked widespread outrage.\nDr Dao, a 69-year-old from Kentucky, was seen with a bloodied face after being forcibly taken off the plane by Chicago airport officers who had been summoned by United employees when he would not give up his seat.\nSpeaking after the incident, on April 9, United chief executive Oscar Munoz said: “The truly horrific event that occurred on this flight has elicited many responses from all of us: outrage, anger, disappointment.\n“I share all of those sentiments, and one above all: my deepest apologies for what happened.\n“Like you, I continue to be disturbed by what happened on this flight and I deeply apologise to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way.”\nThe most recent figures from the US Department of Transportation – dating from 2015 but released this February – show 35 animal deaths occurred during transit across 17 carriers in the States.\nUnited accounted for 14 animal deaths in that period with a further nine reported injured among the nearly 100,000 animals carried by the company.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4446694/United-Airlines-saddened-giant-rabbit-dies-flight-US.html"}
