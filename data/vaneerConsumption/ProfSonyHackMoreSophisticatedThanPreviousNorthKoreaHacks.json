I was surprised by it. Because what we seen in the past does not amount to the same level of sophistication. Very basic attacks is what we’ve seen against South Korea. So I was quite surprised by their capability here and I think we have to take it quite seriously now just as we do the nuclear threat and the missile threat” he stated.\nCha also expressed some confidence that even though “in terms of our bilateral relationship with china on cyber, we’re getting nowhere. we’re adversaries. But this is a case where you have a North Korean actor that can hack into a Chinese company as much as it could a US company. So there may be a small area of overlap where two countries can cooperate.”\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/12/29/prof-sony-hack-more-sophisticated-than-previous-north-korea-hacks/"}
