Players are given a master who controls them for 50 days and each day they are given a task to complete.\n'On the 50th day the masters behind the game instruct the young people to commit suicide and sadly across the world some have done this.'\nYulia (pictured) and Veronika fell to their deaths from the roof of an apartment block in industrial Ust-Ilimsk\nLast month, Devon and Cornwall Police PCSO Kirsty Down posted an online warning to alert parents about the challenge\nPolice officers in Britain have previously posted online warnings to alert parents about the challenge.\nLast month, Devon and Cornwall Police PCSO Kirsty Down posted on Twitter: 'Who ever created this horrible game is sick!\n'Parents: Please be aware of this \"game\" talk to your children about it if concerned.'\nPanic over the online challenge was prompted by the death of two teenagers in Russia in February.\nYulia Konstantinova, 15, and Veronika Volkova, 16, fell to their deaths from the roof of an apartment block in industrial Ust-Ilimsk.\nMeanwhile a girl named only as Ekaterina, 15, was critically injured after she fell onto snowy ground from a flat in the city of Krasnoyarsk.\nJust two days beforehand a 14-year-old girl from Chita was reported to have thrown herself under a commuter train.\nYulia had earlier posted a picture with big blue whale, seen as a symbol of a social media movement encouraging children to take their own lives\nIn all cases state investigators are probing whether a controversial web 'suicide game' has influenced the girls to seek to take their lives.\nYulia left a note saying 'End' on her social page and earlier she had posted a picture with big blue whale. Her friend Veronika wrote: 'Sense is lost... End.'\nIt was reported that two teenage boys were detained by police at the scene after allegedly filming the double suicide.\nIn the Chita case, transport police confirmed that the so-called suicide game 'Blue Whale' is seen as a possible 'cause of death'.\nA second girl had made plans to kill herself with the dead teenager, but changed her mind at the last moment.\nTeenagers are urged to use a knife or razor to make the shape of a whale on their wrist or leg, say Russian reports.\nThey are also urged to watch horror movies all day, and to wake themselves at 4.20am.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446556/Police-warn-Blue-Whale-suicide-game-heading-UK.html"}
