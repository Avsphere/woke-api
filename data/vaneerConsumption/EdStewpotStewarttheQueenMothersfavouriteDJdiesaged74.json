TV made him instantly recognisable and a bigger star. But in many ways, Stewpot — nicknamed for his ability to stick his tummy out — did not fit the celebrity DJ mould.\nHe was gentle, self-deprecating and more likely to be described as a ‘gentle teddy bear of a man’ than a sex-mad party animal.\nBBC DJ Ed Stewart with his daughter Francesca in 2000\nBut... if opportunities came knocking — and they did, frequently for BBC DJs — who was he to turn them down?\nSo, as he recounted frankly in his 2005 autobiography, a chance encounter on a train from Wales led to a ‘very pleasant afternoon’ in his London flat with two pretty Butlins Redcoats and a copy of the Kama Sutra. ‘Fame had its perks.’\nAnd a serendipitous meeting on a flight from Australia in the Seventies saw him and an attractive blonde passenger join the Mile High Club in a jumbo jet loo.\nThere were also several serious relationships which didn’t quite make it up the aisle — with Hammer House of Horror stars Madeline Smith and Ingrid Pitt, and later Eve Graham of The New Seekers, who, after they split, ungallantly described Stewpot as ‘just like a brother to me and I’ve got three brothers already’.\nNot, of course, forgetting the woman he married, Chiara Henney, who — in a twist that still raises eyebrows, given what we now know of some of Stewpot’s Radio 1 colleagues — was a mere 13 when they met.\nFame: Ed Stewart dancing with Derrie Powell at The Premier of the film Grease\nHe, by contrast, was 29. Chiara was still wearing her blue school uniform the day he proposed four years later, sparking headlines of ‘Stewpot’s junior choice’.\nShocking as it sounds today, the relationship didn’t spark an outcry.\nEdward Stewart Mainwaring was born in Exmouth, Devon, the son of a Treasury solicitor, brought up in Wimbledon and educated at St Edward’s School, Oxford, where he played in orchestras, sang in choirs and shone at football. His career started by accident when, after being turned down by the BBC, he set off for Hong Kong as a bass player with a jazz group in 1961, only to discover on arrival that the tour had been cancelled.\nPretending he had experience with the BBC, he talked himself into a job on a local radio station, where he did everything from filling in for the tea lady to sports commentating.\nThe low point was an unfortunate misunderstanding with a Chinese prostitute called Annie Lam. He had no money to pay for a night of ‘wild passion’ he insisted he’d assumed was an affair of the heart. She threw his clothes out of her fifth floor window, shouting ‘foreign devil!’ as he tried to hide his manhood from American tourists in the lift.\nFour years later, he returned to Britain, changed his name to Ed Stewart and got a job as a DJ on Radio London, a pirate station on a rusting ship in the North Sea before finally joining the BBC in 1967.\nEd proposed to wife Chiara when she was 17 and they married four days later\nBut while his career went from strength to strength, and gruesome lines such as ‘I like girls with a good sense of humour, so they’ll laugh at my jokes’ ensured there was no shortage of girlfriends, marriage eluded him. By his 30s he was desperate to settle down, calling himself ‘a soft old geezer who’d like nothing more than a wife and hundreds of kids and dogs running all over the place’.\n‘I was like a rudderless ship,’ he said. And then he met 13-year-old Chiara after paying a visit to her father Jimmy Henney, who managed American singer Glen Campbell.\nThe schoolgirl wore a ‘Stewpot’ badge on her lapel and had pictures of him on her bedroom wall.\n‘I arrived at 7pm and was greeted at the door by what I can only describe as a 13-year-old apparition!’ he said later. ‘She was simply stunning.’\nWhat started as an innocent family friendship grew. Everything changed one night when Chiara was 17 and he realised he’d fallen in love with her, and asked her to marry him.\nThey were wed four days later at Marylebone Register office — after she’d got permission from her headmaster for the day off school.\nStewart would insist he never laid a hand on her before they married. For her part, she later recalled the unconventional honeymoon: ‘The day after our wedding, I woke up alone. Ed had gone to see the World Cup with some BBC competition winners.’\nEd Stewart Wife Chiara and their new-born-son Marco\nWhatever the age gap, they clearly adored each other, had two children and were happy for a long time. ‘She taught me that there is so much more to life than freedom, and parties, and an empty flat,’ he said.\nShe also provided support during his career’s ups and downs. These included meeting Princess Diana (with whom he claimed to have ‘quite a frisson’) and the time he read out the names of four soldiers serving in Northern Ireland who, he said, had asked to hear Danny Boy.\nHe was unaware they had been murdered by the IRA the previous week.\nThe BBC described the error as ‘unforgivable’, explaining that Stewart had mistaken a memo warning the names should not be inadvertently read out.\nHe was dropped by Radio 2 two years later.\nMore humiliating — and seemingly unfair — sackings followed, from Crackerjack for ‘being too old’, then from the BBC altogether when the Radio 2 controller told him ‘request programmes are old-fashioned and out of date and we must move on’.\nAfter moving to Radio Mercury, he was sacked in 1990 for being ‘too expensive’. Throughout, Chiara was at his side. But in 2004 things started unravelling. While Stewart was about to begin a stint in a Cinderella panto, he discovered she was having an affair with a golf pro.\nThe lover moved in and Stewart moved out but returned when his wife’s health suffered (although his replacement remained in situ). Stewart even lent the couple money for a down-payment on a house.\nEd was working up until a recent stroke, planning his 2016 Ed Stewpot Music Quiz Tour\nCharacteristically, he blamed himself. ‘I wasn’t very accessible to her. I’ve often asked myself why I found it so difficult to say those three magic words: “I love you.” I have always retained a certain aloofness and an inability to show affection to those I loved.’\nSomehow, he retained his sense of humour, his sense of vanity (he wore azure-tinted contact lenses, shaved his chest and slathered himself in fake tan) and his (often startling) honesty.\nHe was embarrassed, rather than disappointed when, after trysts with a former Sixties model, she sold her story to the tabloids.\nCruelly, she claimed that during their ten-hour lovemaking session, he used Viagra, and cried out: ‘Ooh baby, I feel so hot. I’m on fire.’\n‘Man Has Sex. Not news, is it?’ he said philosophically in a subsequent interview. Of his enthusiasm for Viagra, he was more forthcoming.\n‘I hadn’t been with another woman for nearly 30 years and I took it as a precaution. It’s bloody amazing stuff. I don’t need it, of course, but you do go on for ever. Once a week, I take this stuff called Cialis, which is slightly more expensive. One touch and you’re away. In the end, the lady concerned was begging me to stop.’\nLately he led a quieter life, working on occasional radio shows, playing golf, doing his bit for charity, supporting his beloved Everton FC and often joking that, while he could remember pretty much every girl he’d slept with, he often forgot what item he’d gone upstairs to look for.\nMeanwhile, his past followed him. ‘I still can’t walk into a pub without someone shouting: “It’s Friday, it’s five to five... it’s Crackerjack!”’ he said last year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393190/Queen-Mum-s-favourite-DJ-wife-met-just-13-29-loved-Ed-Stewpot-Stewart-dies-eyebrow-raising-past.html"}
