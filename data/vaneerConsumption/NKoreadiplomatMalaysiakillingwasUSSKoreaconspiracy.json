It also has refused to acknowledge that the victim was the older half-brother of leader Kim Jong Un, referring to him only by the name in his North Korean diplomatic passport, Kim Chol.\nMalaysian media say police confirmed Kim Jong Nam's identity using DNA from his son which was obtained overseas and brought to Malaysia.\nThe incident has led to a sharp deterioration of ties between Malaysia and North Korea, with each expelling the other's ambassador.\nNorth Korea has blocked Malaysians from leaving the country until a \"fair settlement\" of the case is reached. Malaysia then barred North Koreans from exiting its soil. The two countries have also scrapped visa-free travel for each other's citizens.\nPak Myong Ho, minister of the North Korean Embassy in China, listens to questions during a press conference in Beijing, China, Thursday, March 16, 2017.
