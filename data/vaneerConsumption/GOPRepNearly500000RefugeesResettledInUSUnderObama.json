Brian Babin (R-TX) says.\nAccording to Babin, the administration should not be allowed to continue to expand the refugee resettlement program until the Government Accountability Office completes an audit of its costs. The Texas lawmaker introduced legislation to that end Wednesday.\n“It is extremely unsettling that the Obama Administration would continue to expand the U.S. resettlement program at such an irresponsible pace in light of our economic and national security challenges,” Babin said Thursday.\nIndeed refugees, unlike many other categories of immigrants are eligible for welfare. A recent annual report to Congress from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, for example found that three in four refugees were on food stamps.\n“Our legislation institutes a common sense pause in the program so that we can better understand the long-term and short-term costs that this program has on local governments, states and U.S. taxpayers,” Babin said.\nBabin’s bill would halt refugee resettlement to the U.S. until the GAO has completed its audit. The lawmaker added the the bill would also all for a better understanding of what the program means for national security.\n“It also gives us an opportunity to examine potential national security issues related to entry and resettlement, particularly as federal law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about home-grown terrorists,” Babin said.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/30/gop-rep-nearly-500000-refugees-resettled-in-u-s-under-obama/"}
