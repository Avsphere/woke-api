The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nNew data suggest that the missing Malaysia Airlines jet will be found along “the 7th arc” in the Indian Ocean, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Thursday.\nThe bureau said on its website that “new information and analysis” shows that Flight 370 would have exhausted its fuel by the time it reached “the 7th arc.” That’s the point where the jet’s last hourly transmission, or “handshake,” with a satellite occurred. At that point, the bureau said, the aircraft must have been descending.\n“As a result, the aircraft is unlikely to be more than 20 NM (38 km) to the west or 30 NM (55 km) to the east of the arc,” the bureau said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/missing-jet/malaysian-jet-will-be-found-along-7th-arc-australian-bureau-n123176"}
