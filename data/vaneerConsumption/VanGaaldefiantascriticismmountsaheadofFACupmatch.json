United's style of football under Van Gaal is dull and risk-averse, and the supporters appear to have had enough.\nThe Dutchman said Thursday that he hadn't offered to quit and the support of Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman, was \"fantastic.\"\n\"It gives you a lot of pressure because when the board has such confidence in you, the pressure is much higher than when they say it's your last game,\" Van Gaal said. \"Then the confidence is not so high.\"\nUnited may be playing Derby just at the right time. It has won only one of its last six games — in the FA Cup third round — and has dropped off the top of the League Championship.\nDerby is managed by Paul Clement, the former assistant manager at Real Madrid where he worked under Carlo Ancelotti. Clement said he might speak to Ancelotti before Friday's game at Pride Park.\n\"I am not sure it will quite be a giant-killing if we get a good result,\" Clement said. \"It is a challenge we are really looking forward to, up against a team that is not in great form.\"\nHere are some other things to watch out for in the fourth round:\n___\nCOQUELIN BACK\nArsenal's injury crisis is finally relenting, with the return of holding midfielder Francis Coquelin the latest good news for manager Arsene Wenger.\nCoquelin has been missing since the end of November because of a knee injury, and was expected to be out for three months. He has been back in full training for two weeks, however, and is available for the home match against second-tier Burnley on Saturday.\nWinger Alexis Sanchez has also recently returned from injury, while Wenger said Thursday that forward Danny Welbeck \"isn't far off\" a comeback after being out since April with a knee injury.\n___\nRELIEF FOR CARLISLE\nSome good news for fourth-tier club Carlisle.\nFloods that caused widespread damage to the north of England and Scotland in December took its toll on Carlisle's Brunton Park pitch.\nCarlisle has since had to play its \"home\" matches in different grounds in northern England, which cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.\nCarlisle played its first match back at Brunton Park on Saturday, and hosts Premier League side Everton in the FA Cup on Sunday. It will be televised live, likely earning Carlisle 250,000 pounds ($360,000).\n___\nUPSET OPPORTUNITIES\nWith the demise of Eastleigh in the third-round replays, there are no non-league teams left in the tournament.\nIt will be left to lower-league teams to provide the giant-killings.\nChelsea faces third-tier MK Dons while Tottenham heads to Colchester, which is in last place of the third tier.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421191/Van-Gaal-defiant-criticism-mounts-ahead-FA-Cup-match.html"}
