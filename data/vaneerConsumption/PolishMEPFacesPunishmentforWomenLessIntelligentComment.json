He could face sanctions such as a reprimand, a fine or a temporary suspension.\nKorwin-Mikke, a radical right-winger who leads a marginal party, said during a debate on the pay gap between men and women: “Of course women must earn less than men because they are weaker, they are smaller, they are less intelligent. They must earn less, that’s all.”\nThe investigation was opened under rules specifying that members must show mutual respect and refrain from “defamatory, racist or xenophobic language or behavior.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/03/02/polish-mep-faces-punishment-women-less-intelligent-comment/"}
