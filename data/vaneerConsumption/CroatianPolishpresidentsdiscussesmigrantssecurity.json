Last year NATO invited Montenegro into accession talks.\nDuda stressed that Poland would like the summit to take firm decisions on establishing a permanent presence of NATO troops in the region, where countries are concerned for their security because of their proximity to Russia.\nOn Wednesday, Grabar-Kitarovic and Duda attended ceremonies marking 71st anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi German death camp of Auschwitz, in southern Poland.\nCroatia's President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, right, and Polish President Andrzej Duda walk in front of the guard of honor during the welcoming ceremony, in Warsaw, Poland, Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016.
