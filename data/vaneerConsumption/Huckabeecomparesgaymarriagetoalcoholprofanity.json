Mike Huckabee says gay marriage is akin to alcohol and profanity — options the Republican weighing a 2016 presidential bid says are appealing to others, but not to him.\nHuckabee on Sunday also told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that forcing people of faith to accept gay marriage as policy is on par with telling Jews that they must serve \"bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.\" That dish would run afoul of kosher rules.\nHuckabee says he appreciates different viewpoints on gay marriage, adding that he is friends with gay people.\nHuckabee has made cultural issues the cornerstone of his likely presidential bid. The former Baptist pastor is counting on social conservatives and evangelicals who have great clout in early nominating Iowa to help his bid.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/feb/01/huckabee-compares-gay-marriage-alcohol-profanity/?page=7"}
