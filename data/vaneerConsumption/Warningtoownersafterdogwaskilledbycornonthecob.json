Unfortunately if the animal swallows it whole it can get stuck in the intestine and can’t be passed back out.\n‘We can operate but it is an extremely dangerous operation.\n‘But sadly sometimes the items are too big and they do get stuck. The foreign item gets stuck and causes the dog’s intestines to die off, making them very unwell.’\nDr Ashman said her advice is for dog owners to be vigilant and keep dogs away from corn on the cobs at BBQs or anytime the vegetable is in the house.\nShe said: ‘My alarm bells would be ringing if someone called up to say their animal had swallowed a corn on the cob, it’s sadly very dangerous.\n‘But anytime an owner is concerned they should call up the vets for advice, specialists are available and always happy to talk.’","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319640/Warning-owners-dog-killed-corn-cob.html"}
