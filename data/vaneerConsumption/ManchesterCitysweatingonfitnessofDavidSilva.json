'Gabriel Jesus has no pain at all, so is ready, but three months out means his condition is not optimal.\n'Sergio is much better. Today he played a part and tomorrow he will be ready. United are a good rival with good quality, in good form. We're looking forward to it.\n'Gabriel and Sergio can play together, it depends how you want to play. If you want to play with wingers wide it's more complicated. If you are narrow they can play together.'\nSilva's continued importance to City was obvious after he departed Wembley and he will be afforded the opportunity to prove his fitness on Wednesday afternoon.\nSilva, meanwhile, is a real doubt for the visit of Manchester United according to Pep Guardiola\nGuardiola says Gabriel Jesus is also back fit but lacking match fitness ahead of a huge derby\nLeroy Sane (second right) tries to close down possession during a drill on Wednesday\nVincent Kompany shares a laugh with a team-mate as he trains at the Etihad Campus\nSeason at a glance Live tables\nFixtures\nScores Premier League\nPremier League\nChampionship\nLeague One\nLeague Two\nScottish Premiership\nScottish Div 1\nScottish Div 2\nScottish Div 3\nLigue 1\nSerie A\nLa Liga\nBundesliga\nGuardiola - who claimed he has not bumped into Mourinho in Manchester city centre this season, despite the old foes being neighbours - warned against complacency in the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\n'They have been playing without him but are playing the way Jose wants,' the Catalan added. 'They win duels and it'll be a very difficult game.\n'Ibra is an excellent player but they have great forwards like (Jesse) Lingard, (Ashley) Young and (Marcus) Rashford who find the spaces as well.\n'We have six games left, four of those at the Etihad, so our Champions League qualification depends at home.'\nKelechi Iheanacho waves at the camera as he walks alongside team-mate Bacary Sagna","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4447874/Manchester-City-sweating-fitness-David-Silva.html"}
