I love you, you're my puppy, you're a good puppy, but...'\nThe video then seems to show Rollins dragging the dead dog's body around before burying him in a shallow grave.\n'Kind of put him a little deeper,' Heng then appears to say.\nThe Cumberland County Sheriffâ€™s Office and Cumberland County Animal Control said they found multiple videos of the killing and also text messages talking about it.\nRollins was charged with animal cruelty; as was Heng; both are reportedly still in the county jail on $25,000 bond each\nCam used to be named Huey and was adopted from the Cumberland County Animal Shelter, but apparently not originally by Rollins but someone else. It's unclear when the dog ended up with Rollins\nThe Facebook page Justice for Cam posted a screen shot purportedly from Marinna Rollins saying that Cam was going to a good home, with Heng saying 'He's gonna have such a great new life'\nA Justice for Cam Facebook site sprang up almost immediately, and a screen grab purporting to be from Rollins' Facebook page shows someone who appears to be Rollins saying 'Great last day with the pooch! Sad he has to go, but he will be much happier where he is heading off to :)'\nHeng then wrote: 'He's gonna have such a great new life.'\nRollins was being held on $10,000 bail and Heng on $5,000 bail, but after an outcry by animal lovers, their bails were raised to $25,000, according to the Justice for Cam Facebook page.\nAccording to a picture of the dog posted on the page, Cam was originally adopted from the Cumberland County Animal Shelter in 2015 by a different person.\n'He is super friendly, very sweet, calm and loving. He just wants someone to love him and give him a chance,' the posting said.\nFriends of Cumberland County, NC Shelter confirmed that the dog in the posting was Cam.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4446054/Veteran-tied-service-dog-tree-shot-him.html"}
