We need a new arrangement that lives up to the benchmarks that have been set by the European Court of Justice,\" Wigand said.\nOfficials in the commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU, have said they are aiming to reach a deal around the end of January, without calling it a deadline.\nTop European and US trade groups -- Business Europe, Digital Europe, the US Chamber of Commerce and the Information Technology Industry Council -- in mid-January warned the EU and US President Barack Obama of \"enormous\" fallout for businesses and customers if the two sides fail to strike a deal by January 31.\n\"We understand there has been some progress in the past couple of days,\" Paul Meller, spokesman for Digital Europe, told AFP.\n\"We are cautiously optimistic there will be a deal, if not by Sunday night, then in the coming days after that,\" he said.\nThe European data protection authorities are due to meet in Brussels on February 2-3.\nThe ECJ ruling also alarmed Washington which says it \"put at risk the thriving transatlantic digital economy.\"\nThe landmark verdict stemmed from a case lodged by Austrian law student Max Schrems, who challenged the Safe Harbour arrangement on the grounds it did not properly protect European data.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3423258/EU-US-intense-negotiations-data-transfer-deal.html"}
