The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nTwo top lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that the Obama administration broke the law by not informing Congress before the prisoner exchange that resulted in Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s release.\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss said the administration violated the law by failing to address serious concerns they had about the deal to swap Bergdahl for five Taliban detainees. Chambliss said he had not had a conversation with the White House about a possible exchange for at least 18 months.\n\"It comes to us with some surprise and dismay that the transfers went ahead with no consultation, totally not following law,\" Feinstein told reporters following a closed door meeting. \"And in an issue with this kind of concern to a committee that bears the oversight responsibility, I think you can see that we're very dismayed about it .\"\nBoth also said they do not believe the soldier’s health was a factor in the decision. The White House said Bergdahl’s deteriorating medical state was a reason they did not have time to inform Congress before securing the deal.\nThe senators also said a White House official contacted them to apologize for not giving advance warning.\n-- NBC's Andrew Rafferty and Katie Wall contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bowe-bergdahl-released/top-lawmakers-say-white-house-broke-law-bergdahl-deal-n121721"}
