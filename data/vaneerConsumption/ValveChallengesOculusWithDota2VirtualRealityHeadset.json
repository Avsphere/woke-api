The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nVirtual reality developers and enthusiasts alike recently gathered at the Boston VR Bender, where attendees were encouraged to experiment with the Unity game engine and build new software on the spot. One of the most intriguing finds from the meetup is Valve's 'Dota 2' headset, which provides Oculus Rift-type functionality with sharper displays and detailed motion tracking.\nReddit user jonomf documented his time with the Dota 2 (named after Valve's popular strategy title), noting that the headset provided \"low persistence, perfect tracking [and a] very high frame rate.\" The black headset looks a bit bulkier than the Oculus Rift DK2, with a front panel that drops down to the user's mouth level.
