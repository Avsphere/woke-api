Thanks again for all your help.\nBest, Juliet\nThe article was a review of President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the Democratic Party — “Obama, who once stood as party outsider, now works to strengthen Democrats” — written by Eilperin.\nEilperin (pictured) told Breitbart News: “As with most reporters, I regularly contact officials at the DNC, RNC, and political offices for information. The context of the email was that I honored the conditions of our discussions. The story speaks for itself.”\nWalter Garcia, who is the party’s press secretary for its Western Region, weighed in on the article after it was published: “Not sure if you’ve already seen it, but flagging this article for you guys. Overall, not too bad for us.”\nGarcia pointed out where in the article the DNC’s messaging was reflected in Eilperin final draft — particularly that the president’s own private political machine “Organizing for Action,” which was once “Obama for America.”\nEilperin wrote:\nOrganizing for Action (OFA), the nonprofit group that grew out of Obama’s campaign operation, has continued to compete with the Democratic National Committee for Democratic dollars — first as a parallel organization within the DNC and then as a separate entity. In the first six months of 2013, the DNC raised $30.8 million, while OFA raised $13 million. And this was at a time when the DNC was carrying more than $18 million in debt.\nGarcia also cited a conversation Eilperin related: “During a 2010 gathering of Democratic governors in Washington, according to multiple attendees, one governor asked a senior presidential political adviser, ‘Will the OFA please join the Democratic Party?'”\nApparently, Eilperin had been working with the Paustenbach, because when he forwarded the email to the DNC’s Director of Communications Luis Miranda, Miranda replied: “Yup. Thanks to you and walker for connecting Roberta. I think her line was helpful.”\nThe quote Mirada appreciated was this one: “Close cooperation has taken time; OFA gave the DNC limited access to its list of supporters starting in 2013, but it turned over the entire list only in August 2015. Now, according to Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange, ‘That voter file is used by everyone in our state.'”\nCertainly, the DNC appreciates it anytime there is close cooperation.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/07/24/washington-post-juliet-eilperin-dnc/"}
