Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) supporters for “vicious trolling” Hillary supporters.\nClinton said, “She and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain, just explain, why they supported her, have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often — not to mention sexist — to repeat. All four of them have been subject to these unbelievable personal attacks. From people, how dare you be a part of the establishment. So, now we’ve been told that Planned Parenthood, the human rights campaign fund is part of the accomplishment. It’s a hermetically sealed deal. If you’re not for us, the Boston Globe, the Concord Monitor, the Portsmouth Newspaper, they’re all part of the establishment.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/02/08/bill-clinton-accuses-sanders-supporters-of-vicious-trolling-sexist-attacks/"}
