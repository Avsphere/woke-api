This is a commitment he must honour.\nMeanwhile, he deserves credit for a brave, if difficult, decision.\nCameron said 'no country in Europe has been more generous than Britain in funding refugee camps, whether they are in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon or Jordan' (pictured, migrants in Macedonia)\nGet a grip, George\nHow Tory MPs chuckled when Jeremy Corbyn followed his much-mocked practice of asking the Prime Minister a question posed by a member of the public.\nYet the question from 'Jeff' was one all taxpayers have wanted answered since Google escaped with a £130million bill to cover ten years of unpaid taxes.\nCan the rest of us pay the same rate as the internet giant – a mere 3 per cent?\nBut it's not just the cosy deal that has inflamed public anger. More insulting still was the way it was announced, with 9pm leaks to favoured outlets and a midnight tweet by the Chancellor hailing 'victory'.\nMr Osborne has earned just praise for his achievements but he must get a grip - and stop the spin\nIndeed, George Osborne's attempts at news management were reminiscent of Alastair Campbell at his most cynical.\nYet no spin can hide that this was a lousy bargain for taxpayers and small firms, mercilessly hounded by HMRC, who have to compete on unequal terms.\nMr Osborne has earned just praise for his achievements. But growth is slowing, debt rising and his living wage could cost jobs. Add his misguided tax assaults on pension pots and buy-to-let landlords, and there are worrying signs that he is thinking more about his political ambitions than the British economy.\nHe must get a grip – and stop the spin.\nConfusing the young\nChildren's Commissioner Anne Longfield describes her job as 'making the country a better place to grow up for all children'. To this end, her website has promoted a questionnaire asking those aged 13 to 18 their 'gender identity'.\nThe questions are frankly bizarre. Children are offered a mind-boggling 23 alternatives to the labels 'boy' and 'girl', including 'gender-fluid', 'tri-gender', 'demi-boy' and 'intersex' (and to add to the confusion, they are encouraged to tick as many boxes as they like).\nThis is the jargon of the 'trans' lobby, which campaigns for individuals who have had sex-change operations, dress as members of the opposite sex or regard themselves as neither male nor female.\n'Trans' people are often the victims of bullying and their dignity should be respected. That said, they make up a minuscule fraction of the population. This questionnaire seems designed to sow uncertainty and distress in the minds of all-too-vulnerable adolescents.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3420274/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-brave-difficult-humane-decision.html"}
