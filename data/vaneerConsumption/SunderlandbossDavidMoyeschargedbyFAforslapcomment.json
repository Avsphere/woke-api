Careful the next time you come in.'\nThe 54-year-old was forced to apologies for his remarks, and has since expressed his regret at his behaviour.\nThe Black Cats boss was interviewed by Sparks after his side's goaless draw with Burnley\nSpeaking at a press conference at the beginning of April, after the video had been made public, Moyes said: 'I deeply regret (what I said) and I've done what I had to do and apologised, which I was right to do so.\n'In the heat of the moment, I made a mistake in my comment to a BBC reporter which I profoundly regret.\n'I was disappointed with myself for it. I subsequently phoned the reporter and apologised, which she accepted.'\nMoyes faced demands he resign from him position at the North East club, but refused to do so, despite groups and individuals, such as BBC Match of the Day commentator Gary Lineker, condemning his actions.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-4446954/Sunderland-boss-David-Moyes-charged-FA-slap-comment.html"}
