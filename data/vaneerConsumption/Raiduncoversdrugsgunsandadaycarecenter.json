Michele Pihera said.\nCocaine was located inside the vehicle, and Jimmy Simpkins, 41, was placed under arrest, she said.\nPihera said officers obtained a search warrant early Friday, and arrested Joseph Simpkins, 39 and Eric Zavare Ray, 20. Both were charged with possession with intent to distribute, theft by receiving firearm, possession of marijuana and possession of drug-related objects.
