The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nIt looks the bone-cracking violence that made Mortal Kombat a hit in the 1990s is making a comeback, this time with Mortal Kombat X for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.\nThe trailer released on Monday does not reveal much about game, except that it's going to be really, really gruesome. (Warning: The trailer involves someone's head getting ripped off of his body). Also, instead of the cheesy Mortal Kombat theme song we all know and love, this preview features a new track from Wiz Khalifa.\nSo, what else do we know about Mortal Kombat X? Well, um, both Scorpion and Sub-Zero will be major characters. It's coming out sometime in 2015, and will be released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC as well.\nThe last game to be released in the series was the unfortunately named Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition in 2012.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/finish-him-new-mortal-kombat-trailer-hits-internet-n120336"}
