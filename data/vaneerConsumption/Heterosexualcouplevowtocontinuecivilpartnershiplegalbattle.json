Unfortunately, the judge has concluded otherwise.\"\nMr Keidan said it was \"now time for Parliament to demonstrate its commitment to creating a level playing field for all its citizens by opening up civil partnerships to same-sex and opposite-sex couples alike\".\nExplaining her ruling, the judge said she did \"not accept\" that the enactment of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 had caused restrictions under the Civil Partnership Act on opposite-sex couples entering into a civil partnership \"to become unlawful\".\nThose provisions had \"not become incompatible\" with Articles 14 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - articles which prohibit discrimination and protect the right to respect for family and private life - \"just because same-sex couples now have two routes to achieving legal recognition of their relationship by the state and opposite-sex couples continue to have only one\".\nMrs Justice Andrews said: \" By deciding to wait until it is in a better position to evaluate the impact of the 2013 Act on civil partnerships before taking any legislative steps, against a background where there is no consensus either domestically or within Europe as to the appropriate course to take, the Government is acting well within the ambit of discretion afforded to it with regard to the regulation of social matters.\n\"Opposite-sex couples are not disadvantaged by the hiatus, because they can achieve exactly the same recognition of their relationship and the same rights, benefits and protections by getting married, as they always could.\"\nShe concluded: \"The Government's decision to wait and see serves the legitimate aim of avoiding the unnecessary disruption and the waste of time and money that plunging into a programme of legislative reform without waiting is likely to produce. Consequently, this claim for judicial review fails.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3422268/Heterosexual-couple-seeking-civil-partnership-await-ruling-judge.html"}
