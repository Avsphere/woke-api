The days of rushing to the ATM so you have enough money for the weekend are long gone. Card and even mobile phone payments are increasingly being seen as safe substitutes.\n“Despite this, cash is not likely to die out soon. Four in five consumers say they have used cash in the last three days. Many would not want to go completely cashless and some prefer the privacy and physical sensation of cold hard cash.”","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4446342/Would-cash-free-One-five-Britons-keen-ditch-notes-coins.html"}
