His cough has developed an audible squeaking sound when he struggles to suck in a breath.\nShe said three days later, the disease had ravaged young Riley's body, with his heart and lungs both destroyed by toxins.\n'What happened to Riley is the result of a disease that is not under control in Australia. I hope it makes people think twice about vaccinating,' Ms Hughes said.\nMs Hughes has bravely shared the final intimate moments she captured of her son's short life to show other parents how rapidly his condition deteriorated\nRiley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough\nMs Hughes shared this heartbreaking image of the last time Riley held her finger during his baptism - he was gone 12 hours later\nMs Hughes said that after Riley fell ill she started to research whooping cough vaccinations and found that mothers in America, the UK and New Zealand were being vaccinated during their pregnancy.\nShe said the vaccines had proven to be an effective method for protecting babies from the disease before they were born and instantly questioned why it was only an 'optional recommendation' in Australia.\n'Studies show not only is it safe, but if a Mum has a pregnancy vaccination for whooping cough, her baby is 90 per cent less likely to catch this disease,' Ms Hughes said.\n'Unfortunately, it wasn’t offered to me in my pregnancy,' she added.\nAfter learning of the preventative measure, Mr and Ms Hughes tirelessly lobbied the state government to offer the vaccination to pregnant women free of charge.\nThey were successful and Ms Hughes said that now all pregnant women in Australia should have access to the live-saving vaccine, something she wished was the norm when she was carrying Riley.\n'Riley would still probably be here if I had known about whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy.'\n'Riley would still probably be here if I had known about whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy,' she said\nWhile Ms Hughes said whooping cough is a 'tough disease to completely eradicate, she has dedicated herself to ensuring that no other children due from vaccine-preventable diseases.\nA finalist for the Young Australian of the Year Award, Ms Hughes has travelled the country to speak with parents and work with experts to improve education for new parents on the importance of immunisation.\nShe has spoken with the health minister in Canberra and lobbied the government for an adult immunisation register so adults could know when they are due for a booster.\nNot only has Ms Hughes pushed for education, she has organised donation drives with Unicef Australia to source over 75,000 vaccines for needy children in developing countries and is responsible for raising over $70,000 for research into whooping cough research.\nMs Hughes said the work she has done to fight diseases that can be controlled by vaccines has been a cathartic process that has allowed her and her husband to honour their son every day since his passing.\n'Even though we feel like we failed him as parents, we feel a bit better knowing that we are hopefully helping to protect other babies,' she said.\nMs Hughes will be flying to Canberra in two weeks to find out the results of her nomination at the Australian of the Year awards.\nThe inspirational mother started advocating for immunisation against whooping cough in the days before Riley's death, posting a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children vaccinated.\n‘If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at PMH please keep him in your thoughts!,’ she wrote.\n'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Greg added.\nOn March 17 Ms Hughes then posted the tragic news that Riley had died.\n‘We are devastated to let everyone know our gorgeous sweet month-old son Riley John Hughes lost his battle with whooping cough at Princess Margaret Hospital earlier today,’ she wrote.\n‘He passed away peacefully in our arms after a tough fight. The staff at PMH were amazing and did everything they could to save his little life but the whooping cough was too severe. RIP Riley. Forever in our hearts.’\nHis mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life'\n'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised\nRiley’s father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’.\nGreg wrote that Riley was ‘cruelly cut down before his life had an opportunity to start’.\n‘I'm an absolute shell of a man without my baby boy and I'm truly not sure how I'll cope,’ he said as he honoured ‘the short but enormous legacy this little man has left behind’.\nGreg wrote that the family’s long-term goal is to ‘be the drivers of change within this country surrounding the treatment, management and long term eradication of this horrific disease.'\nThe Department of Health said it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease, also known as pertussis.\nWHAT IS WHOOPING COUGH? Whooping cough (also known as ‘pertussis’) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'. Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother’s antibodies do not provide reliable protection. It’s very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it’s usually not as serious. Symptoms The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive ‘whooping’ noise, which is how the condition gets its name. The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include: runny or blocked nose\nsneezing\nwatering eyes\ndry, irritating cough\nsore throat\nslightly raised temperature\nfeeling generally unwell These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes. Infants younger than six months may not make the ‘whoop’ sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing.

Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years.\n'Riley would still probably be here if I had known about whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy'\nInfectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.'\nHe explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent.\n'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.'\nAccording to the department's notifiable disease report, there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in WA in 2015, compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013.\nData recorded on immunisation rates across Australia on the Department of Health's website shows, in 2012, WA had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall.\nIn WA 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised.\nIn 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'.\n'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393991/Perth-mother-baby-Riley-died-whooping-cough-releases-heartbreaking-video-moments.html"}
