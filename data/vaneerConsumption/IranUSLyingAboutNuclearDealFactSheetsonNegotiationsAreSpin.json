There is no need to spin using ‘fact sheets’ so early on,” tweeted Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif.\nThe solutions are good for all, as they stand. There is no need to spin using “fact sheets” so early on. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2015\nIn two following Tweets, Zarif insisted that the U.S. and EU will remove all economic and financial sanctions on Iran immediately, contrary to what the U.S.-produced fact sheet states.\nIran/5+1 Statement: “US will cease the application of ALL nuclear-related secondary economic and financial sanctions.” Is this gradual? — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2015\nIran/P5+1 Statement: “The EU will TERMINATE the implementation of ALL nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions”. How about this? — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2015\nIran’s state-run Press TV reported that the agreement allowed for Iran to continue enriching uranium, and none of its facilities would be shut down.\n“In the framework of the agreement, none of Iran’s nuclear facilities as well as the previous activities will be stopped, shut down or suspended and Iran’s nuclear activities in all its nuclear facilities including Natanz, Fordow, Isfahan and Arak will continue,” said the Iranian media report.\nIranian media also reported that all of the UN Security Council, United States, and European Union sanctions against the regime will be lifted immediately, once the Joint Plan of Action has been implemented.\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not commented on the agreement that required his authorization for Iran’s negotiating team to sign off on the accord. As dictator of Iran, Khamenei doesn’t answer to anybody, and has no checks on his power, so it remains unclear whether he will weigh in on the nuclear framework.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/04/02/iran-u-s-lying-about-nuclear-deal-fact-sheets-on-negotiations-are-spin/"}
