The Ryder Cup will take place in Hazleton in the US between September and October this year.\nLawrie also hit six birdies on the opening day, but was still five shots off the course record 61 set by Adam Scott in 2008.\nCourse officials had moved the tees forward because of anticipated high winds, but although conditions were again blustery, they were far from unplayable.\n\"This morning the wind was not blowing so hard,\" said Bourdy, one of the earlier starters. \"I think it is a good score, especially the hole-in-one, I'm very pleased about that.\"\nDefending champion Branden Grace from South Africa is handily placed on seven under par, after shooting 67.\nA shot further back are his fellow South Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Ernie Els.\nOosthuizen, one of the pre-tournament favourites, lost touch with the leaders after shooting a disappointing one-over-par 73, in a round that included three bogeys.\nThe cut was set at one under and more than 70 players qualified for the final two rounds on Friday and Saturday, when conditions are expected to be even windier.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3421091/Lawrie-breezes-one-shot-lead-Qatar-halfway-mark.html"}
