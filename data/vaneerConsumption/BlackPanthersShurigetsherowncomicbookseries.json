Without T'Challa around, Shuri will have to decide if she will forego her own passions in order to stand up for her nation.”\nOkorafor is an award winning science fiction author who has already contributed to Black Panther stories including Black Panther: Long Live the King. Her three-part series, Wakanda Forever: Amazing Spider-Man which paired Wakanda’s female warriors -- the Dora Milaje -- with Marvel heroes was released in June.\nOn social media, Okorafor took issue with websites suggesting she was helping to write the series.\n“I’m not “helping to write” this. I’m *writing* this. I just finished writing a draft of issue 2 and, trust me, I know what I did. That wasn’t any “helping to write”. Mscheeeeew,” she wrote.\n>>Related: Did the toy industry strike out on Black Panther merchandise?\n>> More: ‘Black Panther’ brings unexpected boost to makers of African inspired clothing\nArtist, Leonardo Romero, whose work can be seen in Immortal Hulk, will be the illustrator for the series.\nMarvel will release more details about Shuri at San Diego Comic-Con during Marvel's Next Big Thing panel which takes place on July 21.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/blog/talk-town/black-panther-sister-shuri-stars-new-marvel-series/77gZkYRcVtZNuleTqmyxlI/"}
