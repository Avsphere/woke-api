On Sunday, Channel 2 Action News reported the cause of death was drowning.\nBoaters Brandon Davis and Baker Martin had been fishing for a couple hours when they saw something strange about 8:30 a.m., they told Channel 2.\n“I looked over and I was like, ‘Looks like blue jeans,’” Martin told the television station.\n“Looked to be a female,” Davis said. “Could see a tattoo on her back. Shirt kinda bunched up.”\nDavis and Martin, who passed the location three times before they noticed the body, said the woman was laying “over a log by her stomach.” She was not wearing shoes.\nGwinnett authorities assisted Johns Creek in the recovery of the body, Capt. Tommy Rutledge, the spokesman for Gwinnett County Fire and Emergency Services, said in an emailed statement. While the body was found in Johns Creek, it was retrieved on the Gwinnett County side.\nJohns Creek police checked with nearby agencies, but they did not have any cases of missing people who matched the woman’s description, the television station reported.\n—Staff writers Marcus K.
