The complex includes hotels, restaurants, residences and multiple office buildings.\nThe Weather Channel will remain in its offices near the junction of I-75 and I-285 in Cobb, a representative for the channel said. The two companies have been sharing the campus since the deal was completed.\nWeather Company is separate from the cable television channel, though the channel licenses its brand and forecast data and other information from IBM. Weather Company makes apps and provides forecasts and data to the private sector, particularly for aviation, energy and insurance companies, as well as for governments.\nWeather Company plans to create software, engineering, marketing and other jobs, according to a news release from Gov. Nathan Deal’s office.\nThe relocation is expected to take place in spring 2017.\n“The combination of technology and expertise from The Weather Company and IBM is progressing well as we create additional value for the clients of both companies,” Cameron Clayton, Weather Company CEO and general manager, said in the release. “The additional hiring and the move to a new headquarters are indicative of the support and investment that IBM is providing to attract and retain the best and brightest as we build this amazing business.”\nWeather Company spokeswoman Melissa Medori said hiring for the expansion announced Wednesday started shortly after IBM purchased the company and is expected to continue over the next couple of years. The business has about 700 people in Atlanta.\n“The Weather Company has made significant contributions in Georgia for more than three decades,” Deal said in the release. “The company’s decision to expand its workforce in the metro Atlanta area is a reflection of our state’s ability to retain dynamic companies with our business-friendly environment and highly skilled workforce. We look forward to our ongoing relationship with The Weather Company and its continued success in Georgia.”","url":"https://www.ajc.com/business/weather-company-relocate-near-perimeter-mall-add-400-jobs/oM6pqC0VNCbXMbpce3qRAO/"}
