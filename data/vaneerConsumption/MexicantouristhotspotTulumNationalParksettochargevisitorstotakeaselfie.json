Tulum is one of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites and attracts thousands of tourists each year\nJulio Villagomez Villalobos, tourist guides' representative at the archaeological site told The Yucatan Times: 'The charge for the use of cell phones, tablets, GoPros and still cameras or amateur video, within the premises of archeological sites, has generated controversy and anger among tourists, especially domestic.'\nSet by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), tourists will be charged 45 pesos per device when visiting the picturesque resort town. This equates to around £1.70 or $2.50.\nThis will be in addition to the 60 peso (£2.30, $3.30) price of a ticket.\nThe ruins are situated on 39ft-tall cliffs along the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on the Caribbean Sea in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico.\nOver two million people visit Tulum each year, at its busiest some 2,000 people can traverse the ruins each day.\nTulum is as beautiful as it is historic and provides many places to get that postcard photograph\nTourists will be charged 45 pesos per device when visiting the picturesque resort town. This equates to around £1.70 or $2.50\nTulum was one of the last cities built and inhabited by the Maya. It was at its height between the 13th and 15th centuries and managed to survive about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico.\nOld World diseases brought by the Spanish settlers appear to have resulted in very high fatalities.\nThey disrupted society and eventually caused the city to be abandoned.\nOver two million people visit Tulum each year - at its busiest 2,000 people can traverse the ruins each day\nTulum managed to survive about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico\nIn 2015, a total of 12 people are known to have suffered selfie-related deaths after either falling or being struck by a moving vehicle when taking a picture of themselves.\nHowever, according to data compiled by Mashable, only eight people are known to have been killed by a shark.\nAnd experts believe the rise in selfie-related deaths could be down the fact people are more willing to put themselves in dangerous situations, such as with animals or posing from great heights, to impress friends on social media.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3420697/Will-grin-bear-Visitors-set-charged-1-70-taking-selfies-Mayan-site-Mexico.html"}
