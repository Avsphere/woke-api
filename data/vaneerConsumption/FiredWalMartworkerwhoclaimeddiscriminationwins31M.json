He said McPadden had been disciplined before and the lost key led to her dismissal.\nThe Concord jury deliberated for 2.5 hours before ruling on Wednesday for the plaintiff, McPadden, after a five-day trial, according to her lawyers.\nMcPadden claimed that Wal-Mart used her loss of a pharmacy key as a pretext for firing her in November 2012, when she was 47.\nShe said she was fired in retaliation for her raising concerns that customers at the Wal-Mart were getting prescriptions filled improperly because of inadequate staff training, according to Reuters.\nMcPadden also said her gender played a role, alleging that Wal-Mart later disciplined but didn't fire a male pharmacist in New Hampshire who also lost his pharmacy key.\nMcPadden's lawyer told Reuters in a phone interview that the jury reached 'a fair and just verdict'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423232/Fired-Wal-Mart-worker-claimed-discrimination-wins-31M.html"}
