As the board filled up, we noticed that all of these responses had one alarming thing in common.'\nScroll down for video\nStarting from the top: The filmmakers at A Plus put up a blackboard outside Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino Park in Brooklyn, New York City instructing people walking by to write down their regrets\nFilling up: A video of the stunt shows the blackboard being quickly filled up by people walking by, with failing to follow dreams seeming to be one of the most common threads\nGetting the info: The video also sees some of the people writing regrets explain the background behind their chosen words\nThe chalkboard was up for one whole day and was completely filled with multi-colored tales of regret by the end of the day.\nIn the video, the filmmakers also interview the people participating to get more details behind their offering on the board.\n'I regret all the time I wasted, not saying \"yes\" to things,' says one woman, while another claims she 'did all the things that were, like, plan b'.\nFailing to follow dreams seems to be one of the most common regrets among those who choose to write on the board, with one young lady in a winter hat with cat ears lamenting how she wishes she had followed her artistic ambitions.\n'I wanted to do so many things, but I could never seem to find the time,' she says.\nLearning a lesson: Many of the regrets are about education, with people saying they wish they had studied things from med school to acting to an MBA\nLooking back: This young man writes his regret as 'burning bridges' as he tells the filmmakers how he had been homeless until recently, something that he may have prevented if he hadn't hurt others\nGoing the other way: This New Yorker describes how she only 'did all the things that were, like, plan b'\nFinding the pattern: The filmmakers point out that many of the regrets contain the word 'not' in them, saying they are 'about chances not taken' or 'about words not spoken'\nOther regrets written are based in education with one person expression remorse over not getting their MBA, another regretting not applying to med school and another wishing they'd studied acting.\nOn the other hand, many of those walking by rather write about their past relationships, such as one person who wishes they had been a better friend, while another wishes that they'd had children before their father passed away.\n'Up until recently I was homeless. If I hadn't hurt the people that I had, maybe I wouldn't have been,' explains one young man as he writes his regret on the board as: 'Burning bridges'.\nNext the video reveals the 'alarming' thing that the regrets have in common: the word 'not'.\nTaking it down: After the board is full of regrets, the passersby are given erasers to wipe away whatever they had written\nEmotional: The young woman on the right appears to be on the verge of tears as she views the empty board, calling it 'hopeful'\nPossibilities: The young woman also declares the empty board to be 'where I wanna be. Where I wanna go'\nOut of mind: This young woman claims that she is leaving her regrets behind\nClearing it off: The video ends with the tearful young woman writing 'Clean Slate' across the blank board\n'They were about chances not taken. They were about words not spoken. They were about dreams never pursued,' the video explains.\nBut in a symbolic gesture, the filmmakers then give the people who had written on the board erasers, and they go about erasing the words off of the board.\n'A clean board feel like where I wanna be. Where I wanna go,' says one young woman, looking over the clean blackboard, appearing on the edge of tears. 'It's hopeful.'\nThe video ends with the final woman writing the words 'Clean Slate' across the empty board, while the filmmakers add: Every day is a clean slate. Do the things you'll regret not doing.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3421536/Chances-not-taken-words-not-spoken-dreams-never-pursued-New-Yorkers-reveal-biggest-regrets-world-writing-chalkboard-posted-street.html"}
