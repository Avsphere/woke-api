Gareth Bale misses out, perhaps due to his Tottenham Hotspur connections - although ex-Spurs man and current Bernabeu hero Luka Modric does make the cut.\nThree members of the Germany side join Ozil in his team, including goalkeeper Manuel Neuer\nCentre back Jerome Boateng is another pick by Ozil from the current world champions\nManchester City and Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is the anchor in Ozil's dream side\nReal captain Sergio Ramos and left-back Marcelo make up the XI.\nAlso notable by his absence is Lionel Messi, the Barcelona and Argentina forward not lining up among Ozil's favourites.\nHowever the lack of Gunners is notable, particularly in a week where Arsenal were humiliated in the Champions League by Bayern Munich 10-2 on aggregate after 5-1 defeats home and away.\nBallon D'Or and Euro 2016 winner Cristiano Ronaldo makes it but Lionel Messi does not\nRonaldo's fellow BBC front man Karim Benzema leads the line while Gareth Bale misses out\nBernabeu hero Luka Modric makes the cut despite his Tottenham Hotspur connections\nReal Madrid captain Sergio Ramos is at the heart of Ozil's ideal defensive line-up\nReal left back Marcelo is chosen above Arsenal options Nacho Monreal or Kieran Gibbs\nExplaining his reasons behind choosing the Arsenal layers who did make it, Ozil said pace and ambition were the major factors.\nHe said: 'Bellerin is the fastest player in the world I think. On the right Sanchez because he works a lot and really wants to be successful.'\nIt is thought Sanchez wants to be successful away from Arsenal, the Chilean linked heavily with a move away from the Emirates Stadium in the summer after a training ground bust up, which saw him benched for the Premier League game at Liverpool by manager Arsene Wenger.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4300888/Arsenal-star-Mesut-Ozil-picks-just-TWO-Gunners-world-XI.html"}
