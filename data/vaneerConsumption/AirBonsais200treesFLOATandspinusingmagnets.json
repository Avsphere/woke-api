The tiny trees contain spongy balls of moss that contain magnets that sit above a porcelain base that similarly contain magnets which repel those found in the moss\nThe firm has already amassed more than 2,000 backers on its Kickstarter page, and has raised almost half a million dollars.\nAccording to Hoshinchu, the kit is made up of two parts - an 'energy base' and the 'little star' which floats a few centimetres above the base.\nHOW DO THE TREES 'FLOAT'? The Air Bonsai kit is made up of two parts - an 'energy base' and the 'little star' which floats a few centimetres above the base. The 'stars' are spongy balls of moss 2.3-inches (6cm) across containing magnets weighing around 250 grams. The porcelain base contains magnets and a rotating mechanism and is connected to the mains by an AC adapter. The magnets repel each other to create the illusion of levitation. To plant the trees, customers poke a hole in the ball and add the cutting of the plant or a seedling. The website shows a number of bonsai trees which have been grown for a number of years spinning off the ground. An additional pot is available in the form of a lava stone, instead of the moss ball.\nThe 'stars' are spongy balls of moss that measure 2.3-inches (6cm) across.\nThese balls contain magnets that weigh around 250 grams, while the porcelain base contains magnets and a rotating mechanism and is connected to the mains by an AC adapter.\nIn a demo video, producer Hakaru Hoshi passes a piece of cardboard between the base and the floating moss ball to prove its not a hoax.\nAs part of a do-it-yourself kit, growers transplant their small plant into the star to get it growing.\n'You have the mossy \"little star\" ready for transplanting your favourite plant,' the company explained.\n'The \"energy base\" that conducts magnetic energy makes your plant float.\nThe porcelain for the 'energy base' is made of traditional Japanese Imari.\n'Mass production is achieved through use of moulds for this basic kit.'\nTo plant, customers poke a hole in the ball and add the cutting of the plant or a seedling.\nThe website shows a number of bonsai trees which have been grown for a number of years spinning off the ground.\nAccording to Hoshinchu, the kit is made up of two parts - an 'energy base' and the 'little star' which floats a few centimetres above the base (examples pictured).
