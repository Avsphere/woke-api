The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nAn Indiana man has been arrested and charged for making serious threats against House Speaker John Boehner.\nU.S. Attorney Joseph Hogsett announced the arrest of Brandon Thompson, a 32-year old from New Castle, Indiana who was arrested Thursday night and has been charged with threatening an elected official in telephone calls and over e-mail.\nNBC News has obtained the criminal complaint against Thompson which claims that Thompson threatened the Speaker over his refusal to extend unemployment benefits. Thompson wrote an email through the contact feature on Boehner's web site saying, \"You want to play with 2.7 million people's lives, I am going to take yours, you'll never see it coming with my sniper rifle.\"\nThompson also obtained Boehner's wife's cellphone number and left the following message: \"I'm coming after your oompa loompa [expletive] husband. He shoulda … he shoulda extended unemployment insurance. Now, it’s too late.\"\nBoehner's office is not commenting on the matter, referring questions to the Capitol Police.\nIn a statement announcing the arrest, Hogsett said, “free speech is the cornerstone of our democracy but threats of violence have no place in our civil society. People who are inclined to make them need to know that they violate the law and they will be aggressively pursued.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/indiana-man-charged-threats-against-speaker-boehner-n101746"}
