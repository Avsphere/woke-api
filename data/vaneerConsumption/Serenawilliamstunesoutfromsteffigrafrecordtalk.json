If I don't win on Saturday, I'll still be one off. It took me forever to get to 18. I was so stressed out. I don't want to relive that at all.\"\nWilliams threatened to embarrass her semi-final opponent Agnieszka Radwanska on Thursday, annihilating the Pole 6-0 in a first set that took just 20 minutes.\nThe form of the American, who won 6-0 6-4 and is yet to drop a set so far, has fed the suspicion she is unstoppable in Saturday's final.\n\"I think everything is stoppable at some point, I guess,\" Williams said.\n\"She (Kerber) took out a really tough opponent in Victoria (Azarenka).\n\"You can't underestimate Kerber. She's beaten me before, too, and pretty good. I know that she brings a lot to the game.\n\"Her being a lefty definitely helps out as well. I haven't played any lefties yet. But we'll see. I think if I do play her, it will be a really good match. It definitely won't be easy.\"\nKerber has beaten Williams once, in Cincinnati in 2012, but she has lost all of their other five meetings without winning a set.\nRadwanska suggested the world number one may be unbeatable in this kind of mood.\n\"I'm not even angry because I know she was just playing too good today,\" Radwanska said.\n\"There was just no mistake. Unbelievable serve, everything. She was going for it. I couldn't do much - nothing at all, actually.\"\nKerber has taken on Graf, her childhood idol, as something of a mentor, practising with her last year in Las Vegas and maintaining contact since.\nAfter beating Britain's Johanna Konta 7-5 6-2, Kerber was asked on court if Graf might give her some tips on how to beat Williams.\nKerber said: \"I hope so, Steffi write to me please!\"\nBy the time her press conference had come around an hour later, it appeared the seven-time Wimbledon champion had delivered.\n\"She wrote to me, but I was not able to check it right now,\" Kerber said.\n\"I just saw that. I think she sent me a text message, but I don't know what she wrote yet.\"\nKerber is the only woman left who can preserve Graf's grand slam record. Does she feel a duty to her compatriot?","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3420719/Serena-Williams-tunes-Steffi-Graf-record-talk.html"}
