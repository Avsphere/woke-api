Now a new statue is in the works, thanks to a redevelopment of the property.\nArtist Nijel Binns confirmed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he’s been commissioned to immortalize the legendary West Coast rapper and actor.\n“We are honored to be commissioned to create what we expect will be ‘the’ defining bronze portrait sculpture of Tupac Shaker for the Peace Garden and Amphitheater,” he said in an email.\nThe Stone Mountain arts center opened in 2005, a project of Afeni Shakur, the musician’s mother, a part-time Atlantan. It had a dance studio and classes for kids and was a passion project for her.\nAfeni Shakur died last year.\nJim Burnett bought the center for $600,000, according to Rolling Stone. The magazine reported last year that he intended to redevelop it to include office suits, an indoor play center called Jumps R Us and a water park.\n\"It works in perfect conjunction with what Afeni was doing with the kids,\" Burnett told Rolling Stone. \"We're not going to allow the Shakur name to die.\"\nThe monument is expected to be unveiled in September, around the 21st anniversary of Shakur’s shooting death in Las Vegas, Binns said.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram\nIn other DeKalb County news:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/dekalb-tupac-statue-disappeared-now-new-one-finally-coming/0XiShG3IJ4R0OxfXWuEwdM/"}
