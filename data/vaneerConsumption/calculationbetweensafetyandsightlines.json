Suddenly, there was a commotion in front of me, with people scurrying, some screaming, everybody staring. I figured it must be a fight with all the beer flowing and Yankees fans hollering.\nBut as I scanned the aisles, there were no fisticuffs.\nA man with a boy, perhaps 7, with his mitt and his little Braves hat, walked up the aisle. They looked stunned. It happened right in front of him, the man said. Right in front of him, the boy confirmed. It was a terrible thud, they said. Then the two hurried away.\nTorpy happened to be at the game where Gregory “Ace” Murrey fell to his death. It was a sad, surreal moment in which the crowd gasped and the game went on.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/braves-stadium-death-sorrow-and-surreality-the-ballpark/kolQFPJS6H5VzBjCXBAmPL/"}
