According to eFinancial Careers, some alumni have started to refer to the year's new class as \"'Weicheier und Heulsusen' or 'wimps' (literally 'soft eggs') and crybabies.\"\nOne alumnus quoted by eFinancial Careers said that \"the only ones humiliated by the Welcome Week were those who were too full of themselves.\"\nAlumni approached by the Financial Times had a similar view. Reshma Sohoni, who graduated in 2003, told the paper: \"There are always one or two people who get upset about being humiliated but I think it builds character. It is about not taking yourself too seriously.\"\nThe school has acknowledged the feelings of alumni, but said that the wellbeing of students must be prioritised at all times.\nIn a letter to alumni, dean Ilian Mihov said that the school needed to shut down welcome week in order to comply with the investigation into the complaint.\n\"We understand that there is strong support for the welcome week tradition in the alumni community,\" Mihov wrote, according to the FT's report.\n\"However, student health and wellbeing are our top priority and welcome week cannot continue if it moves students to file a formal complaint.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/insead-suspends-welcome-week-humiliation-2018-7"}
