It is on display at Mossad headquarters and will be returned to Cohen’s family in the fall.\nCohen infiltrated Syria’s leadership in the early 1960s and obtained top-secret intelligence before he was caught and executed in 1965.\nSyria has refused to return Cohen’s body to Israel.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2018/07/06/mossad-retrieves-wristwatch-of-legendary-1960s-israeli-spy-eli-cohen/"}
