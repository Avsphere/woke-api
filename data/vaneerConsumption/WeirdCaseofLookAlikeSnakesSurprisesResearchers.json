The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe recent extinction of a lethal snake in the North Carolina Sandhills has led a harmless serpent that lives there to mimic the deadly snake, researchers say.\nThis finding surprised researchers, who had expected that the harmless snake would evolve to look less like the extinct snake, since mimicking an extinct animal wouldn't provide any survival advantage.\nThe animal kingdom is full of examples of harmless creatures evolving to mimic fierce beasts in order to ward off predators — a strategy known as Batesian mimicry. For instance, hoverflies both look and sound like more dangerous wasps and bees.\nAnother example of a Batesian mimic is the scarlet kingsnake, a nonvenomous serpent that resembles the venomous coral snake.Coral snakes are colored in repeating patterns of black, yellow, red and yellow rings; the red rings are surrounded by yellow rings. In contrast, scarlet kingsnakes are colored in repeating patterns of red, black, yellow and black rings; the red rings are surrounded by black rings. [See Stunning Photos of Snakes of the World]\nBoth snake species live in the southeastern United States, although the scarlet kingsnake also dwells farther north. Experiments have shown that predators avoid plastic replicas of the scarlet kingsnake in areas where coral snakes also live, but not in places farther north, where the venomous reptiles do not live.\nCoral snakes once lived as far north as the North Carolina Sandhills, a region of gently rolling, sand-covered hills covering about 1,500 square miles (3,900 square kilometers). However, no specimens of this serpent have been collected there since 1960 — scientists are unsure why they apparently went extinct there. By contrast, scarlet kingsnakes are common there.\nHow Kingsnakes Change Their Look\nEvolutionary theory predicts that once the harmful animal being copied goes extinct, there is no longer any benefit that the mimic gets from imitation, and in turn, this mimicry should fade away over time. To see if scarlet kingsnakes did, indeed, change once the venomous coral snake they copied was gone, the researchers compared five specimens of coral snake collected before 1960 with 27 specimens of scarlet kingsnakes collected in the 50 years after the coral snake disappeared from the North Carolina Sandhills.\nThe scientists measured the width of each ring, calculating the proportions of red and black.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/weird-case-look-alike-snakes-surprises-researchers-n128621"}
