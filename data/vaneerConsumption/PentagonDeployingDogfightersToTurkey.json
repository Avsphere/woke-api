Those fighters carry bombs and air-to-ground missiles.\n“In stark contrast, the F-15s only carry air-to-air weaponry, and their pilots train exclusively for shooting down enemy warplanes,” acknowledges the Daily Beast. “It’s worth noting that F-15Cs have never deployed to Afghanistan, nor did they participate in the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq. The war in Syria is different.”\n“The dogfighters are part of a broader escalation of the air war over Syria,” it adds. “In addition to jets in Jordan, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, and Navy and Marine planes aboard aircraft carriers, the U.S. Air Force recently added A-10 attack jets and rescue planes and helicopters at Incirlik in Turkey.”\nThe growing number of warplanes being deployed to Incirlik are the primary component of a new northern anti-ISIS effort by the United States, a Department of Defense (DOD) official told reporters on condition of anonymity on Oct. 30.\n“One of the principal things we will do to put pressure in the border area and into Syria is, quote, ‘thicken’ air operations in northern Syria,” said the official.\n“That means we want a greater density of planes striking. We need a greater density of intelligence assets developing targets…the White House announced A-10s, which are already on the ground at Incirlik, and F-15s forthcoming… in Incirlik, to help in the counter-ISIL campaign,” added the DOD official.\nThe U.S. and Russia have held discussions to prevent their jets from colliding as they conduct independent and sometimes conflicting bombing missions.\n“They are keenly aware of what happens, as we are, over the skies of Syria, and coming in and out of Syria,” the Pentagon official said, referring to Russia’s military planners.\nU.S. officials accuse Russia of intervening in Syria on behalf of dictator Bashar al-Assad. Moscow denies it, saying they are targeting ISIS.\nA recent analysis of Russian Defense Ministry data shows the Kremlin’s air force has been primarily targeting anti-Assad rebels, including those who are supported by the United States.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/11/04/pentagon-deploying-dogfighters-turkey-didnt-say-wasnt-russia/"}
