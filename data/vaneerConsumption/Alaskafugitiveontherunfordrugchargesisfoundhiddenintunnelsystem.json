Lance Ewers said Beebe, 42, had failed to report to the police department on January 12 after he was sentenced to nearly two years in prison, the Sitka Sentinel reported.\nActing on a tip, officers staked out a trailer park Wednesday and saw Beebe heading in to one of the units.\nA woman who answered the door said Beebe was not there and that she didnâ€™t know where he was.\nPolice then used a battering ram to get through a plywood door they found on the outside of the trailer, which led to a crawl space that was the entrance to the tunnel system.\nFound you: Police in Sitka, Alaska, uncovering the opening of a tunnel system under a trailer with the help of the property's landlord. Hidden in the tunnel was Jeremy Beebe, 42, a fugitive wanted on felony charges\nAs officers walked farther into the tunnel, it became tighter.\nUsing flashlights they saw Beebe, wearing a hoodie and facing the officers.\nBut he backed away until he was out of sight.\nThe officers then went around to the other side of the trailer and found another entrance, where they noticed Beebe's foot.\nHe was finally pulled out and arrested. Police say the incident occurred around 9.30pm.\nBeebe may now face additional charges of contempt of court, Ewers said.\nSitka Police Sgt.
