Ten people were rescued, while the bodies of four boys, three girls, three men and one woman were recovered.\nThe coast guard said five of the rescued were found clinging to a piece of floating wood, leading authorities to believe they had been in a wooden vessel that sank. The survivors were in shock and unable to provide clear accounts of what happened or how many people had been on board.\nVolunteers help an elderly woman from Afghanistan to disembark from a dinghy after her arrival with other migrants and refugees in the village of Skala Sykaminias, on the northeastern Greek island of Lesbos on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2016.

Only two people were rescued from that incident.\nGreece, with thousands of kilometers of coastline and islands very near the Turkish coast, is the main gateway into Europe for refugees and migrants. Hundreds have died attempting to make the short but dangerous crossing in unseaworthy, overcrowded vessels.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420533/Greek-coast-guard-says-11-people-children-drown.html"}
