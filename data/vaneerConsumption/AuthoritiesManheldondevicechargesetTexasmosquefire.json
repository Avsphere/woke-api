No one was hurt in the fire.\nIn her order denying bond for Perez after Thursday's hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington cited \"testimony of his involvement in a hate crime presently being investigated.\"\nPerez's lawyer, Mark Di Carlo, told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times the charge already filed against his client was related to \"five large firecrackers that were taped together on to one fuse.\" The attorney said that while allegations about the mosque fire were disclosed at the hearing, Perez has not been charged in that case.\nCourt documents show that exhibits presented at the hearing included photos from Perez's home of a shotgun, a .38-caliber revolver, a knife, body armor and \"xtreme fireworks.\"\nEllington's order indicated an infant and toddler also were living in Perez's home but did not specify their relationship to him. The revolver was found on a highchair.\nThe federal criminal complaint accused him of possessing an incendiary device that should have been registered in a federal database known as the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.\n\"His possession and use of an unregistered destructive device ... and his possession of loaded firearms out in the open in his home with an infant and a toddler living at the same home demonstrate that he represents a serious danger to the community,\" the judge said.\nThe order also indicated Perez had no previous criminal history.\nThe fire occurred hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. That order was later blocked by the federal courts.\nA GoFundMe campaign that set a goal of raising $850,000 to rebuild the mosque was closed after topping $1.1 million.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4299616/Authorities-Man-held-device-charge-set-Texas-mosque-fire.html"}
