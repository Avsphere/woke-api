The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nThe father of one of the high-flying acrobats injured in a Ringling Brothers circus accident in Rhode Island said it's a miracle they all survived the terrifying 35-foot plunge.\n\"The accident was very, very horrible,\" Roiter Neves told NBC News in a phone interview from Brazil shortly after his 24-year-old daughter, Widny Neves, emerged from surgery on her badly broken arm.\nThe dad, a veteran circus performer himself, said he saw a video of the mishap in which a circular metal platform suddenly fell from the rigging while his daughter and other troupe members were suspended from it by their hair.\n\"The first thing in my mind is nobody can survive. It's too high and too heavy, too many girls. But no one is dead from this accident.\"\n\"Maybe God put his hand down and just put the girls on soft wings.\"\n\"Obviously something happened that shouldn't have happened\"\nIn addition to a broken arm, his daughter suffered minor fractures to her back and neck and will need months of physical therapy to recover.\nBut he had no doubt she would return to big top and its most daring acts.\n\"All circus acts are dangerous jobs,\" he said. \"If you work in that field, you accept the risk.\"\nInvestigators have not yet determined the cause of the accident during Sunday's 10:30 a.m.show at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, where stunned parents and confused children watched as medics tended to the injured below them.\n\"Everyone was freaking out,\" said Sydney Bragg, 14. \"We heard this huge clatter and then we just heard the girls scream.\"\nPolice and fire officials, along with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, were working with circus employees to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.\n\"Obviously something happened that shouldn't have happened,\" Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare said at a Sunday evening briefing.\nFeld Entertainment, the parent company of Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey, canceled two later performances on Sunday and one slated for Monday morning.\nIt was unclear if the 7 p.m. show will go on, but officials said all aerial acts would be grounded until investigators were certain it was safe.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/circus-accident/dad-injured-circus-acrobat-says-its-miracle-they-survived-plunge-n96911"}
