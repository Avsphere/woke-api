Perry sold the land and house to a property developer, Lennar Atlanta, who cleared the site for future real estate development.\nBut the land is back on the market and not being taken care of. Some Johns Creek residents want city leaders to buy the land and flip into something that north Fulton County can be proud of.\n“They’ve got no takers, and so now its back on the market and it’s not being taken care of. They’ve turned into bad neighbors,” Irene Sanders, who lives near the old Perry estate, told Channel 2. “It’s turning into an eyesore.”\nSanders showed the station examples of overgrown grass, abandoned spec homes and a leak from a pond on the property that is going into a stream feeding the Chattahoochee River.\nJohns Creek Mayor Mike Bodker told Channel 2 the city has attempted to buy the property about “half a dozen times” but all the sellers – Perry and now the developer – want too much money.\n\"The numbers just simply don’t make sense. We still have a fiscal responsibility to the citizens of Johns Creek,” Bodker said. “We simply can't bail out a bad deal just because people want us to. Most of the things that made this property so incredible, so unique, other than being on the river, are gone. They’ve been scraped clean.”\nLike North Fulton County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram\n﻿MORE FROM WSBTV’s MIKE PETCHENIK...","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/neighbors-tyler-perry-old-johns-creek-home-turning-into-eyesore/ketd0SsNbxwq9OcDz1yuWP/"}
