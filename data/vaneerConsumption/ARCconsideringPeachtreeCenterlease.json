The ARC and its 200 employees are currently based downtown at the United Way of Greater Atlanta headquarters campus on Edgewood Avenue.\nThe relocation is being spurred by United Way’s plan to market the office complex for potential future redevelopment. ARC could move, upon completion of lease negotiations, by next summer.\nKerry Armstrong, chairman of the ARC board and an executive with development firm Pope & Land, said in a news release the move fits with the ARC’s philosophy.\n“Peachtree Center will provide us with expanded and enhanced amenities, including improved accessibility for those riding bus or rail transit, in a highly walkable area,” he said. “ARC has been working for decades to foster this kind of development throughout the Atlanta region.”\nARC will occupy about two-and-a-half floors in International Tower and will also control 9,000 square feet of conference and meeting space.\nPeachtree Center owner Banyan Street Capital is in the process of an overhaul of the mall in the multi-tower mixed-use development, which was designed and developed by famed Atlanta architect John.
