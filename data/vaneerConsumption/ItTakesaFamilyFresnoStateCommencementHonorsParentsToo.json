I recently graduated from California State University, Fresno. Though it is a very diverse institution, Latinos make up 40 percent of the student body. Many of them, like me, are first generation college students.\nMy mom, Patricia, traveled the path thousands prior had paved in order to give her two daughters a tangible future, especially an education. As a five-year-old girl, I was unaware of what would await us on the other side of the border from Mexico. My mom knew it wouldn’t be easy but we definitely weren’t prepared for all the hardships life would eventually throw our way.\nLike many other Latinas, I was charged with taking care of my family from a young age, though I had an unparalleled support system. It was not visible since my mom worked fourteen hour days, but I knew she cared and wanted the best for me. That would be reinforced when she would set me aside, her face etched with permanent lines of endurance and tears in her eyes, that I should never give up.\nI did not. After four years of hard work at Fresno State, I was named the Dean’s Undergraduate Medalist for the College of Social Sciences. In my college's convocation, I was the only undergraduate to give a speech, half of which I gave in Spanish. I wanted to let my mom know how much her sacrifices meant to me and how grateful I was.\nBut I also attended another very special commencement at my university - Fresno State's Annual Latino Commencement Celebration (LCC), which has a 38-year history. I was one of 840 Latino graduates walking into the Save Mart Center to the applause and cheers of 12,600 family members and guests. Under the leadership of Dean Luz Gonzalez, this event has grown from a modest ceremony 38 years ago to the largest event of its kind in the nation.\nWhen we finally get to that stage, it isn’t just our names that are uttered but also those of our parents. It takes an entire family to get us through college, and to be able to celebrate that is the best reward.\nIn this commencement, when we finally get to that stage, it's not just our names that are uttered but also those of our parents. Hearing my name followed by “hija de Patricia Reyes” (daughter of Patricia Reyes) almost brought tears to my eyes.\nNo other ceremony recognizes our parents, the original DREAMERS, who sacrificed and toiled through sweat, blood and tears to get us this far. It takes an entire family to get us through college, and to be able to celebrate that is the best reward.\nIt’s a very special celebration, not only because we’re graduating but because this marks a huge milestone for our communities. In addition to our immediate family, there are cousins, uncles, nieces, grandparents, and friends who travel from all over the state to see us walk.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/it-takes-family-fresno-state-commencement-honors-parents-too-n124706"}
