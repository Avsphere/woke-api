If Belichick retains Garoppolo the Patriots will have, beyond doubt, the best quarterback situation in football with the best quarterback to ever play the game backed up by a guy who could start for over half the league. Should Brady get hurt this year, Belichick would still have a realistic shot at making a Super Bowl run with Garoppolo, everything else staying even.\nOn the other hand, should Belichick trade Garoppolo, a Brady injury in all likelihood ends any realistic chance at winning a championship.\nTom Curran of CSN New England says it will take multiple first-round picks for Belichick to reconsider trading Garoppolo. The most likely fit for Garoppolo would be the Browns, who have multiple first-round picks and a huge need for a quarterback.\nHowever, if the Patriots would consider spreading those first-round picks out over a couple years, there’s the chance that other teams could come into play. And, of course, since Belichick seems like the kind of guy who would like to watch Twitter break, there’s always the chance that he could pull off the most Belichick move of all time and trade Brady after this season, then promote Garoppolo.\nBut he wouldn’t do that, would he?\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2017/04/24/report-jimmy-garoppolo-trade-not-happening/"}
