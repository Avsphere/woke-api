She could take advantage of Europe’s migrant crisis by entering Russian territory disguised as a Syrian refugee, officers said.\nBreitbart London has reported on the ease of travel which Europe’s migrant invasion has afforded would-be Islamic State terrorists.\nIn September five men were arrested as they attempted to cross the Bulgarian-Macedonian border with decapitation videos and Islamic State propaganda on their phones. The terrorist suspects had been posing as refugees.\nFormer Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also warned that terrorists are hiding in plain sight among the Syrian asylum seekers and tough border controls are needed to seal porous frontiers against people who regard western civilisation as ‘Satanic’. He said:\n“The problem of Islamist extremism is severe and it’s not going away anytime soon, particularly with this Caliphate remaining in place in Syria and Iraq which is encouraging its sympathisers right around the world to carry out attacks.”\nIn February, the Turkish intelligence service warned police in an internal memo that up to 3,000 trained jihadists are seeking to cross into Turkey from Syria and Iraq, who could then travel through Bulgaria and Hungry into western Europe or into Russia. And in May, a Libyan government adviser warned Islamic State operatives were being “smuggled to Europe in migrant boats.”\nRussia has become increasingly concerned over the threat of a Paris-style terrorist attack in Moscow and other major cities.\nMoscow’s security chiefs shocked locals by declaring that Red Square – the traditional spot for seeing in the New Year – would be off-limits to revellers amid heightened fears of terrorism.\nISIS has vowed vengeance on Russia for its military campaign in support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\nThe terror group has already claimed responsibility for October’s bombing of a Russian airliner in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el Sheikh, in which 224 people died.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/12/30/migrant-invasion-help-dying-bomber-planning-islamic-state-attack-europe/"}
