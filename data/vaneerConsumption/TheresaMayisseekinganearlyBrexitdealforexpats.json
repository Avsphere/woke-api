Tusk said that the Brexit vote had created \"anxiety and uncertainty\" for Europeans living in Britain.\nSimilarly May has been attacked for not guaranteeing the rights of Europeans living in the UK.\nLabour MP Gisela Stuart, who campaigned to Leave the European Union, said earlier this week that \"Britain should make clear at the start of the Brexit negotiations that EU citizens already here before that date can stay.\n\"We should expect reciprocal deals for Britons living in European countries, but Britain should make the first move to demonstrate goodwill.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-is-seeking-an-early-brexit-deal-for-expats-article-50-2016-12"}
