He was released late Tuesday.\nRakhmat Akilov, a 39-year-old Uzbek man, has pleaded guilty to a terrorist crime for ramming the truck into a crowd on a main pedestrian shopping street in the Swedish capital. Police have not disclosed a motive for the attack and no extremist group has claimed responsibility for it.\nAkilov's Swedish residency application was rejected last year but police said there was nothing to indicate he might plan an attack.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4446734/2nd-suspect-Stockholm-truck-attack-released.html"}
