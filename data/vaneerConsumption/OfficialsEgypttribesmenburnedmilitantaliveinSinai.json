The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to reporters.\nThey say the killing came just hours after an Islamic State suicide bomber attacked a tribal checkpoint in northern Sinai and killed four members of the Tarabeen tribe on Tuesday.\nThe incident is the latest escalation in the conflict in the restive peninsula, where Egyptian forces have been battling a growing insurgency with local tribes mostly remaining on the sidelines.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4447344/Officials-Egypt-tribesmen-burned-militant-alive-Sinai.html"}
