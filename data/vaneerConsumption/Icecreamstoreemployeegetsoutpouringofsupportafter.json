And I don't think it's a good thing to teach your kids, but it happens, I guess.\"\n>> Read more trending stories\nThe woman then took to Yelp to share her thoughts about the ice-cream experience, as well as Elwood’s weight.\nThe Yelp review has since been deleted, but was shared by Elwood’s mother on Facebook:\n“One of the female employees Jessie? Jennifer? J something, is disgustingly obese, and each time we come in, although she does her job, and is very polite, instantly makes my appetite disappear. I understand the need to hire bias free, but when someone’s (sic) looks interfere with my experience at an establishment I can’t help but complain. As a mother, I don’t like my children thinking they will look that way by eating too much ice cream.”\nSadly, it’s behavior Elwood, 19, has grown accustomed to hearing from others.\n\"Unfortunately, it wasn't something that I'm not used to. It's kind of. I've had my whole life,\" Elwood said. \"I'm kind of used to it, which is horrible, but it's just something that I kind of dealt with throughout my life.\"\nShe returned to work Saturday to a show of balloons, flowers and notes of praise.\n\"It's never good to hear those things about yourself,\" Elwood said. \"You know, it definitely didn't make me feel good, for sure, but the community and stuff and all the support I've gotten from my employer and just from friends and coworkers has been amazing. It's been a good experience.\"\nShe is going to school to become a doctor. A GoFundMe page was set up to help.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/national/ice-cream-store-employee-gets-outpouring-support-after-fat-shaming-customer/Dx1n9xfxG707xn2E0ILIaL/"}
