Over time, the latches can rust and cause the secondary hood latch to remain open. If the main latch isn't closed and the car is driven, the secondary latch may not hold the hood down, Nissan said in documents posted Friday on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.\nFILE - In this Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2012, file photo, vehicles are reflected on the logo of the Nissan Motors Co. at a showroom in Tokyo's Ginza shopping district. Nissan announced Friday, Jan. 29, 2016, that it is recalling nearly 930,000 Altima midsize cars worldwide, some for a third time, to fix a latch problem that could let the hood fly open while the cars are moving.

But Nissan spokesman Steve Yaeger said the company has no reports of any crashes or injuries.\nNissan says in two previous recalls in 2014 and 2015, dealers adjusted latches and applied lubricant. But if the lubricant wasn't put on evenly, the problem could persist.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422776/Nissan-recall-Altimas-time-fix-hood-latches.html"}
