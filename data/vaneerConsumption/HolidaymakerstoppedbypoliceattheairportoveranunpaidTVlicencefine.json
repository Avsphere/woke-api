It's nicer to start your trip without that worry hanging over you.'\nA spokesman for the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service added: 'If a person fined by a court does not pay, the fines enforcement officers in the sheriffdom in which the fine was issued pursue the defaulter.\n'If the person does not appear at court after being ordered to do so, or if the fines officers can provide evidence to the court that the present whereabouts of a defaulter are unknown – usually because correspondence has been returned unanswered – then they can apply to the court to issue a warrant.\n'The Sheriff then has the option to issue a warrant. The warrant, once signed by the Sheriff, is sent on to the police who enforce it.\nPolice at Edinburgh Airport insisted the money was outstanding from a case at Dundee Sheriff Court, but the fine had already been waived by a judge\n'A port or airport arrest happens when the police have intelligence that suggests a person is either arriving the country, and as mentioned on the phone, this applies throughout the UK.'\nLast year, Linda had been arrested for non-payment of her TV license but the sheriff had waived the fine when he found out she had spent a night in the cells.\nShe said that on the night she arrived at the airport she agreed to hand over the £55 because she just wanted to get home.\nShe said: 'This was my house-keeping money that I couldn't really afford but I reckoned it was the best way to deal with the matter that night because it was then after midnight.'\nShe left the airport but had missed her bus and says she paid £85 for a taxi home.\nWhen Linda went to Bell Street police station in Dundee the next day to complain about what had happened, she says that police admitted the mistake.\nDocuments were later sent to Linda's lawyer saying the money could be reimbursed.\nThey stated: 'We note that the fine had actually been remitted to nil at Dundee Sheriff Court.'\nLinda said: 'They told me they were aware that the matter had been dealt with and I should never have been detained in Edinburgh.\n'They eventually offered to pay me back the £55 but said they had no obligation to refund my taxi money because I had been approached by police at the airport in good faith.\n'I am refusing to accept the £55 until they refund me the £85 as well. I also want an apology. This whole thing was a horrible experience.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421052/Holidaymaker-stopped-police-airport-unpaid-TV-licence-fine-didn-t-owe.html"}
