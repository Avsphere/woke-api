In response, Le Graet called him a \"little man\", used another expletive, threw down the money for the meal and then walked out, according to Le Parisien newspaper, whose account was confirmed by other football sources.\n\"I was insulted,\" Champagne told AFP, also confirming the media reports. Le Graet, a frequently outspoken character, would not comment on the meeting.\nInfantino is to give more details of his programme at a conference in London on February 1.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3423233/Sexwale-calls-anti-Europe-campaign-FIFA.html"}
