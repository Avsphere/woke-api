Martina is an amazing champion and it's a privilege for me to play with her.\"\nAfter a roller coaster opening set where breaks were traded, the top seeds were taken to a tiebreak but quickly got the upper hand and comfortably came out on top 7-1.\nThey got an early break in the second set and the seventh-seeded Hlavackova and Hradecka, playing together since 2008, never looked like getting back in it.\nThere was a chink of light when the Czech pair broke Hingis at 2-5 as she was serving for the championship, but they were then broken themselves as the accolades went to their opponents.\nHingis and Mirza have been hugely successful since teaming up last March at Indian Wells, and the now world number ones went on to reach 10 finals last season.\nThey opened their 2016 campaign by winning titles in Brisbane and Sydney, and now Melbourne.\nIt was the 12th career Grand Slam doubles title for Hingis, who has now won five Australian Opens (1997, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2016), two French Opens (1998, 2000), three at Wimbledon (1996, 1998, 2015) and two on the New York hardcourts in 1998 and 2015.\nMirza, married to former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, has won three, all with Hingis.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3422351/Hingis-Mirza-make-three-Grand-Slam-titles-row.html"}
