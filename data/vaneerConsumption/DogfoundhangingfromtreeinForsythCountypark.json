Forsyth sheriff’s Cpl. Robin Regan said the fallen branch was still high enough to leave the animal hanging.\n“The owner of the dog was located after our animal control deputy observed a social media post about a missing dog while trying to locate its owner,” Regan said.\nIn a Facebook post, Steven Blackstone, the 2-year-old dog’s owner, wrote: “There are some screwed up people with a screwed up mind to do what they did to her. It’s just unreal.”\nRegan said a necropsy would likely be done to determine the cause of death.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/dog-found-hanging-from-tree-forsyth-county-park/Pa640AqhZxa2Hzqt52JVnK/"}
