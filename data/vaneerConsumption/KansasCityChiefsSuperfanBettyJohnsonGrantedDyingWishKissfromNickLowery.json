She became such a staple on the sidelines that former Chiefs wide receiver Dwayne Bowe would often seek the elderly fan out to give her a quick smooch for luck before each game.\nBut on Thursday Johnson’s health quickly began to fade and she related to family members that her dying wish was to see her beloved Chiefs one last time before her time was up.\n“She loves them so much,” Johnson’s daughter Susan told Fox. “Her Chiefs were more important to her than her home.”\nThe team heard her wish and sent former kicker and Chiefs Hall of Famer Nick Lowery to give the ailing superfan one last goodbye kiss.\n“We sang a prayer, and he was going to leave, and we noticed that she was no longer breathing,” Johnson’s granddaughter Autumn Barricks said after the visit from Lowery. “We believe that she was just waiting to say goodbye to her Chiefs.”\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2015/04/18/kc-chiefs-superfan-betty-johnson-granted-dying-wish-kiss-from-nick-lowery/"}
