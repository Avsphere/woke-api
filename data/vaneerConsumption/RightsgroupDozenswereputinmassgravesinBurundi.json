Two journalists on assignment for the French newspaper Le Monde were among 17 people swept up in a military operation Thursday, said Moise Nkurunziza, a deputy spokesman for Burundian police.\nJournalists Jean-Philippe Remy of France and British photographer Philip Edward Moore were released on Friday afternoon, Le Monde said.\nFrance, which had called on Burundian authorities to free the journalists, suspended its security defense cooperation activities in Burundi late Friday.\nWitnesses described how police and local officials scoured Nyakabiga and other neighborhoods in Bujumbura to retrieve the bodies of those who were killed late last year and took them to undisclosed locations, according to Amnesty International.\n\"The imagery, dating from late December and early January, shows disturbed earth consistent with witness accounts. Witnesses told Amnesty International that the graves were dug on the afternoon of Dec. 11, in the immediate aftermath of the bloodiest day of Burundi's escalating crisis,\" the group said.\nEarlier this month, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein also called for an urgent investigation into the alleged existence of mass graves following the violence in December. Zeid said the \"increasing number of enforced disappearances, coupled with allegations of secret detention facilities and mass graves is extremely alarming.\"\nSamantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Friday the reports of mass graves \"underscore the futility of trying to cover up such crimes. Perpetrators of atrocities in Burundi must realize that the international community is watching and those responsible for such horrors will be brought to account.\"\nBurundi's government has dismissed these allegations, saying they are based on false information supplied by the regime's opponents.\nIn coordinated attacks, gunmen stormed three military installations in Burundi on Dec. 11. The next day, 28 people were found shot dead in three Bujumbura neighborhoods. An witness told The Associated Press that some of the dead had their hands tied behind their backs. Another witness blamed government security forces, saying they went after the victims in door-to-door searches.\nPresident Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to seek re-election to a third term last April touched off street protests that led to a failed coup in May and a rebellion that has left the central African country on the brink of civil war.\nThe Burundian government has rejected the proposed deployment of African Union peacekeepers in Burundi, saying they will be treated as an invading force.\n___","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422514/Arrests-allegations-mass-graves-Burundi-unrest.html"}
