The process appeared in part spurred by the presence of media and County Commissioner Nancy Jester. Jester met reporters to tour the apartments, which she said have been failed by management and the county.\n“DeKalb County let it get like this,\" Jester said.\nThe complex is emblematic of the struggles of south DeKalb, which has been plagued by crime and ramshackle apartments with often absentee landlords.\nJester’s decision to call attention to Creekside Forest is unusual because it isn’t in her district. But she said having such a development in a potential growth area is a concern for all of DeKalb. Commissioner Larry Johnson represents the area but didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nMany of Creekside Forest’s challenges are obvious: used diapers, beers cans, muddy clothes and various bit of trash are littered throughout. The pool water is brown. The mail has stopped. Buildings are boarded up, damaged by flooding and vandals. In one battered unit, someone put out cigarette butts on the carpet and left empty liquor bottles and a bag of an unknown crystalized substance.\n“We don’t have air. Half of us don’t have water. There’s mold everywhere,” Olivia Hines, who lives in the complex with her children, said Wednesday morning. “Nobody comes out here to check on us.”\nResidents said conditions went down drastically when Creekside Forest was sold last year and they stopped paying rent because no one knew where the money was going.\nAccording to the county, the owner is a man named Nisels Cheskel. He couldn’t be found for comment.\nThe DeKalb spokesman, Brennan, said Cheskel seems committed to cleaning up — and DeKalb has been pushing “aggressively,” issuing 228 citations in July and setting a court date for Sept. 27.\nResidents will take some convincing to believe change is truly coming. Most burst out laughing Wednesday when told the county feels the owner is cooperating.\nA day later, Brennan said trucks were at the apartments working and would be back Friday morning.\n“The taxpayers are not paying for that,” he said. “The owner of this complex is paying for that.”\nFor those who spend time at the apartments, changes can’t come soon enough.\nSecurity guard Francis Johnson said squatting brings myriad problems. He claimed he recalled seeing a body on the pavement one morning while kids loaded a school bus.\nThe issues brought to mind another complex for Commissioner Jester: Brannon Hill, the notorious burned-out condos in Clarkston.\nCreekside Forest might be “Brannon Hill 2.0,” she said.\n\"We’ve got to hold negligent owners accountable and our employees have to do their jobs,\" she said.\nBrennan released to The AJC a preliminary resident relocation plan, which was dated Tuesday. It said the county intends to work with Decatur Cooperative Ministries and a local housing authority to help residents and even some squatters.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/amid-outrage-dekalb-vows-help-slums-plagued-violence-and-squatters/RWe5kLB1SFp0UbojOEP1CI/"}
