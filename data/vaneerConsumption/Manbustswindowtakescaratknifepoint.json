She lost her purse. It’s my understanding she had gifts in her vehicle for the holiday season.”\nPolice do not have any strong leads.\nLike North Fulton County News Now on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter and Instagram","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cops-man-busts-window-carjacks-woman-knife-point-alpharetta/HNmjHbeo8FBLcdWckf1KBJ/"}
