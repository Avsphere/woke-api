It read, after all, very much like a suicide note. The story is still developing.\nHere's the message — according to TMZ — that Gracin posted to his Facebook Thursday:\nI've loved her for 17 years ... I made mistakes ... I admitted them, told her the truth and she turned her back on me when I needed her help the most. Please remember me as someone who gave his all in his music ... Pray for my family as they carry on in this world without me. Goodbye.\nIt's the kind of message that would put anyone on high alert. According to TMZ cops \"rushed to his house. Though Garcin himself was not there, his wife was, and she and the police got in touch with the former American Idol contestant, who assured them he was headed home.\nThis story is a tricky one: As things seem to still be in the process of developing, no one really knows the full story yet. We can only hope for the best: That Garcin gets the help that message was clearly crying out for, and that he comes out of this unharmed. It's also a reminder: If anyone you know posts a message like this, get them help as soon as you see it. Let's hope this story moves forward in a positive way.","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35871-american-idols-josh-gracin-writes-apparent-suicide-note-panic-ensues"}
