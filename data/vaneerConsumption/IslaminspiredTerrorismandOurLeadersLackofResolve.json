What have we done ? Nothing. What have we learned? Nothing. Why? Because we continue to refuse to face Islam-inspired terrorism for what it truly is. This is an endemic ideological practice inspired by Islam that continues and will continue to grow and cast its nets across the world. Worse, we have yet not done anything to stop and destroy this political movement -- yes, political movement -- disguised in the name of religion. It is an epidemic problem of such a magnitude that each day we do nothing, it grows tenfold. And yes, they are amongst us. That said, the battle against terrorism, as with any threat, should not be engaged at home, but as far from U.S. shores as possible. That has always been a hallmark of U.S. national security and foreign policy. It has been so since the late 1800s. It is one of the reasons we have kept U.S. forces, intelligence...

Islam will look for and seek out more liberal institutions to infiltrate and sew their seeds of propaganda, indoctrination, and ideology. Let me make one other point very clear. As noted, we are dealing with Islam. Until we are able to approach and address this issue on a \"mature\" level and face the problem for what it truly is, and calling it what it is, innocent people will continue to die, both at the hands of the radical Islamists, and by fault of the those (politicians and pacifists) who fail to call it out for what it actually is. As I noted, this Islam-inspired scourge and its radical ideology and vengeful tenets is a ‘political movement,’ cloaked in a so-called “religion of peace”. To their advantage, they know that is our weakness, and that by virtue of political correctness, we will continue to entrap ourselves in a never-ending effort to pacify, appease, and placate the Jihadist aggressors. And of course, never forget to stipulate, “how dare we, and who are we to criticize Islam?” Despite attack after attack, this endless cycle causes us to continue to rationalize our weakness and failures, and continue to question why and how did this happen -- again. Rather than address the threat, implement cogent plans of action to take on the problem head-on, and show resolve and do it, we continue to ask why.
