As he came closer he realized the object was a person and immediately took action.\n\"The instincts come in,\" he said. \"Turned the boat around, spun him and threw him a life ring, got him aboard, got him warm, called the Coast Guard, gave the coordinates and brought him [to shore].\"\nThe man reportedly told authorities that the boat he was on capsized, possibly after catching fire, around 7 p.m. Saturday with several other passengers aboard.\nOfficials said the man was hypothermic after being in the water for at least 12 hours, and some of the details surrounding the incident were unclear.
