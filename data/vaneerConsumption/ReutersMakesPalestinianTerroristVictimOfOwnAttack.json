In failing to mention that the Palestinian was a terrorist, readers of Reuters are also led to believe that he was a victim in the attack.\nPalestinian media reported that the attacker was identified as Ramallah resident Fadi Hasib, the brother of the terrorist Shadi Hasim who also perpetrated a car-ramming attack in the same area last week.\nHonestReporting.com put a call out requesting readers to demand that Reuters change its headline.\nAs of this publication, the headline remains unchanged.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2015/11/30/reuters-headline-makes-palestinian-terrorist-the-victim-of-his-own-attack/"}
