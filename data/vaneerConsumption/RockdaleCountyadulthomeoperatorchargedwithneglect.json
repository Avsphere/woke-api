Michael Camp said Thursday.\nClark, owner of Care Oasis, allegedly moved a dozen adults in her care, aged 30s to 60s, from motel to motel after being cited for running a personal care home in a residential area. During that time, their care was neglected, with several staying in a single room, Camp said. At one point, he said, they were forced out of one motel and spent time outside without food or medication.\nThe adults have since been taken into protective custody, Camp said. Authorities continue to investigate the case, he added.\nClark is in Rockdale County jail with a bond set at $125,000.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/rockdale-county-adult-home-operator-charged-with-neglect/RNSxXpQCOGNFEHLIfm6nlK/"}
