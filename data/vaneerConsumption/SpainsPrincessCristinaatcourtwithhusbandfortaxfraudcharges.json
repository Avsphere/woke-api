Cristina has arrived at court ahead of an historic trial that marks the first time a member of Spain's royal family has faced criminal charges since the monarchy was restored in 1975.\nThe 50-year-old Cristina, who faces two counts of tax fraud carrying a maximum prison sentence of eight years, was seen entering the court building in Palma on the island of Majorca.\nShe was accompanied by her husband Olympic handball medallist turned businessman Inaki Urdangarin, who will also sit in the dock along with 16 others.\nThe Princess is accused of allegedly failing to declare taxes on personal expenses paid by a real estate company she owned with her husband.\nShe has become the first member of Spain's royal family has been put on trial.\nCristina's lawyers called for the case against her to be thrown out, citing Spanish jurisprudence which allows an accused to escape trial if the victim of a crime does not back the charges.\nIn this case, the alleged victim is the state, and public prosecutors have always refused to press charges against Cristina.\nBut the argument was rejected by lawyers representing anti-graft campaigners Manos Limpias or Clean Hands.\n'All citizens are equal before the law and as a result anachronistic doctrines cannot be applied' that would 'privilege' the princess, Virginia Lopez Negrete, lawyers for the group, said.\nLopez added that dropping the case against Cristina would harm Spain's justice system.\nMr Urdangarin faces more serious charges of using his Duke of Palma title to embezzle about 6 million euros ($6.5 million) in public contracts through the nonprofit Noos Institute he ran with an associate.\nThe princess said nothing to dozens of reporters after arriving at a makeshift courtroom in Palma de Mallorca where the trial is being held.\nSecurity was tight around the building after thousands of anti-monarchy protesters in 2014 staged noisy demonstrations while Cristina answered questions about the case posed by a investigative judge.\nAuthorities Monday morning detained one protester with an anti-monarchy flag a short time before Cristina showed up at the court inside a sedan with dark tinted windows.\nThere are so many defendants and lawyers plus reporters covering the case that judicial officials were forced to move the trial from a courthouse to a sprawling building complex on the outskirts of Palma de Mallorca normally used to hold mass training courses for public servants.\nScroll down for video\nThe case is being heard in the regional capital of Spain's Balearic Islands because many of Urdangarin's business deals were for the islands.\nThe princess and her husband are not expected to utter a word during the first few days of the trial as judges read out the 89 alleged crimes committed by the suspects, and lawyers including Cristina's make arguments aimed at having their clients removed from the case.\nPrincess Cristina (right) was accompanied by her husband Olympic handball medallist turned businessman Inaki Urdangarin (left), who will sit in the dock along with 16 others.\nPrincess Cristina is pictured listening to proceedings after arriving at the court building in Palma, Majorca this morning\nPrincess Cristina (back left in the court room) and Inaki Urdangarin (back right) have denied any wrongdoing\nShe denied knowledge of her husband's activities during the 2014 closed door court appearance and a prosecutor recommended she should be fined.\nBut a judge decided Cristina could be charged with tax fraud in 2007 and 2008 because Spanish law allows groups to file charges when state prosecutors don't.\nThe couple, who have four children, have denied any wrongdoing.\nThe princess said nothing to dozens of reporters after arriving at a makeshift courtroom in Palma de Mallorca where the trial is being held\nCristina denied knowledge of her husband's activities during the 2014 closed door court appearance and a prosecutor recommended she should be fined\nSpain's Princess Cristina, right and her husband Inaki Urdangarin arrive at a courtroom for a corruption trial, in Palma de Majorca\nThe popularity of Spain's royal family has revived since former king Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 in favour of his 47-year-old son Felipe and former television journalist wife. The new king regularly tops popularity polls of public figures.\nFelipe was proclaimed king in a low-key ceremony in 2014 and has since worked to modernise the monarchy, paring down the royal family's formal members and taking duties away from his two sisters.\nHe stripped Cristina of her title of Duchess of Palma in June.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393399/Spain-Princess-Cristina-heads-court-tax-fraud-trial.html"}
