(DeKalb County Police Department)\nThe family is hurt and angry, a friend said.\n“He cared a lot of about his family. He adored his children,” Paul Preyer told Channel 2. “They're certainly angry about why this happened and the children don’t quite understand how it occurred and particularly why their father.”\nPolice haven’t identified any suspects, at least not publicly.\n“They can run from the law and they can’t run from their conscious and they can’t run from God,” Preyer said.\nAnyone with information can leave anonymous tips and be eligible for rewards of up to $2,000, by contacting Crime Stoppers Atlanta at 404-577-8477, texting information to 274637 or visiting crimestoppersatlanta.org.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/dad-laid-rest-dekalb-cops-need-help-finding-road-rage-killer/jgV85qhLMPkQ8kPXCxdbiN/"}
