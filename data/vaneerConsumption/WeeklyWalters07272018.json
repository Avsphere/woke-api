Opponents say it would violate the state constitution because revising the constitution can only be initiated in the Legislature.\nCalifornia may be the nation’s richest state, but it also has the nation’s highest level of poverty, thanks to its high cost of living, especially housing. However the political response has been tepid tokenism.","url":"https://calmatters.org/articles/commentary/weekly-dan-walters-2018-07-27/"}
