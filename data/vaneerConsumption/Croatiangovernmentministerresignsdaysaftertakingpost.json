Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic says he will name the new minister in coming days.\nCrnoja sparked outrage when he announced plans to form a \"list of traitors and aggressors\" from the 1991-95 war for independence. Media have also reported that Crnoja registered a false address to avoid paying taxes and that he had been jailed for violent behavior.\nCrnoja said he was resigning to avoid being a burden.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3422304/Croatian-government-minister-resigns-days-taking-post.html"}
