His value climbed $1.3 billion on the back of a booming rental and apartment market.\nAnother iron ore magnate, Andrew Forrest, dropped 12 spots to 22 with a net worth of $1.24 billion, down 41 percent from last year, making him the biggest loser in percentage terms.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420488/Miner-Rinehart-loses-billions-richest-Australian-crown.html"}
