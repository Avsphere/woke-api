The committee voted without any objections to a proposal that the entire board vote on Olens at its Oct. 12 meeting.\nThe committee’s action was not a recommendation to hire, only that the whole Board of Regents vote. Olens, though, apparently swayed several committee members.\n“He did an outstanding job,” University System of Georgia Chancellor Hank Huckaby said of Olens’ meeting with the committee.\nOlens was not present when the committee took its vote.\nIf Olens is appointed KSU’s president, Gov. Nathan Deal is expected to appoint a replacement for attorney general.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/kennesaw-state-vote-sam-olens-presidency-set-for-oct/bjeH8wLFwVtUPgp2v1RRAK/"}
