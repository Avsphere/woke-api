Vulnerable people targeted included a young mother in a women’s refuge.\nManagers from Capita, the firm paid £59million a year to collect fees for the BBC, told an undercover reporter he could earn bonuses of up to £15,000 a year for taking as many people as possible to court.\n98 Beeb bosses paid over £150,000 The BBC now has even more bosses who earn more than the Prime Minister, despite promising to cut top salaries. About 3,400 staff have been axed since 2010 to hit savings targets, official figures show. But the number of senior managers on more than £150,000 has risen to 98 from 89, despite a target to cut the figure by 20 per cent. Sixty one of them earned more than £170,000 last year. It has also failed to cut the number of top jobs in its workforce to one in 100. The National Audit Office urged the BBC to ‘review its outstanding targets for senior managers’ and ‘keep a tight grip on costs and numbers’. The BBC has cut the staff payroll by 6 per cent from £921million in 2010 to £862million in 2015-16 through efficiency savings and staff relocation.\nOne said: ‘We will drive you as hard as we can to get as much as we can out of you because we’re greedy.’ We also revealed how more women than men are jailed for fee evasion each year.\nFollowing the Mail’s investigation, BBC director-general Tony Hall wrote to Capita, saying it had ‘fallen short of the standards the BBC has a right to expect’. Days later, Capita chief executive Andy Parker was forced out of his job. The firm is investigating the Mail’s findings and has suspended two managers.\nThe PAC today says it expects Capita to report back with findings in relation to the Mail’s probe in the coming weeks, and raises fresh concerns about how women are being ‘unfairly’ targeted.\nIts report reveals how 133,000 out of 189,000 prosecutions for evasion in 2015 – approximately seven in every ten – were against women.\nThe committee says there is an ongoing investigation into gender disparity in licence fee prosecutions. It called for both Capita and the BBC to ‘change their approach rapidly once they understand the reasons for the problem’. The report also highlights how the broadcaster makes £16million a year by overcharging struggling families, as reported by the Mail last month.\nThose who pay quarterly by direct debit are charged a £5 ‘premium’ on top of the annual £147 fee, affecting about three million people who cannot afford to pay in one go or do not wish to do so.\nTony Hall wrote to Capita, saying it had ‘fallen short of the standards the BBC has a right to expect’\nDespite tactics used by enforcement officers, Capita’s approach to collections has resulted in fewer evaders being caught, the report states, resulting in the BBC losing out on between £251million and £291million in revenue.\nCapita says it does not target women or vulnerable people and that its incentive scheme applies to licence sales, not convictions. It said the decline in evaders caught ‘demonstrates that our focus on encouraging people to buy a licence at an earlier stage is very successful.’\nTV Licensing said an independent review had found no evidence to suggest women are targeted.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4445816/BBC-rapidly-change-aggressive-fee-collection-methods.html"}
