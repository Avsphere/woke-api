That album, called Depression Cherry, comes out on Sub Pop on Aug. 28. Today we get to hear a first song from the album, called \"Sparks,\" and I interviewed Beach House about it.\n\"Sparks\" has that familiar beauty we've come to expect from Beach House, but with a twist: The song begins with a vocal loop accidentally captured at the band's soundcheck in Bristol, England. Victoria and Alex were so fascinated by the sound of the loop that they held up their phones to record the loop of Victoria's voice, which now runs throughout \"Sparks,\" setting up a tension with both the harmonies of the keyboards and the newly sung parts.\n\"The chaos is what excited us so much,\" Alex Scally told me in that interview yesterday. As the song unfolds, that tension gives way to some resolve, which is echoed in the words sung by Victoria Legrand (you can see the song's full lyrics below). \"I feel that some of the words are quite direct in a certain way. I think it's addressing certain energies in our world as humans,\" she told me. At the end of the song, when she sings, \"Make it, wave it, alive,\" she singing about the moment when \"the grander, more abstract realm\" connects with something more direct.\n\"It's that moment when music and words become the feeling,\" Victoria Legrand said. \"I feel like that's sort of the ideal for us in music, for ourselves; when we feel it, we know that it's right. That moment is almost like a metaphor for what we aspire to.\"\nYou can hear that interview now or download it in the All Songs Considered podcast.\n\"Sparks\" Lyrics:\nWe drive around this town\nHouses melting down\nA vision turning green\nIs all we've ever seen\nAnd then it's dark again\nA new development\nwishing that it meant\nsomething natural\nDon't we know it's cruel\nAnd it goes dark again\nJust like a spark\nHallucination comes\nThink of everyone\nThat never shared before\nFrom my mouth to yours\nAnd then it's dark again\nJust like a spark\nAnd then it vanishes\nNo one around\nAnd then it comes again\nJust like a spark\nAnd then we're vanishing\nNo one around\nAnd then it comes again\nJust like a spark\nYou go to school\nYou follow all the rules\nYou live inside\nRealize\nthere's something in your eyes\nYou're back again\nFrom the spine rising through the mind\nYou give it up\nIt's a gift\ntaken from the lips\nYou live again\nMake it\nWave it\nAlive","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2015/07/01/418896007/hear-sparks-a-new-song-by-beach-house"}
