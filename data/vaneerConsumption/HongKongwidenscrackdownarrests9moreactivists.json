They were newly elected to office last year amid a rising tide of anti-China sentiment in Hong Kong, where fears are rising that Beijing is tightening its grip on the semiautonomous city.\nLeung said the charges, which relate to events on Nov. 2, were \"ridiculous.\"\nOn that day, they scuffled with guards as they barged into the chamber, leaving the council session in disarray.\n\"We are still lawmakers at that time when we wanted to get into the chamber. Why is it unlawful?\" he said.\nThe two said the charges were politically motivated.\n\"We are not afraid of this suppression and we will persist in our beliefs,\" Yau said.\nOther cases include:\n- Nine people, including university professors, former student leaders and lawmakers, arrested last month on public nuisance charges for their involvement in the 79-day \"Umbrella Movement\" protests over electoral curbs;\n- Legal challenges against four pro-democracy lawmakers who the government says also took their oaths improperly;\n- A lawmaker charged earlier this month with desecrating the Chinese and Hong Kong flags after he inverted some on the desks of pro-government members during one of the chamber's chaotic sessions last year.\nPro-independence lawmakers Sixtus Leung, left, and Yau Wai-ching, second frm left, walk out of a police station after being released on bail in Hong Kong, Wednesday, April 26, 2017.
