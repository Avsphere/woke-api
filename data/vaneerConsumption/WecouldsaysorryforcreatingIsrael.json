To my mind, an apology – yes. You could do one. A Labour Government could probably get that through.’\nShe added: “But it sounds a bit Tony Blair to me though, and we all know what happened to him.”\nWhen contacted by the newspaper, Miss Huq immediately backed away from the sentiment, saying the remarks she made did not reflect her actual views.\n“I don’t think that, those aren’t my views,” she said. “I was answering a question. I went on later to say that there shouldn’t be an apology. I have supported Labour Friends of Israel events and am a signatory to the We Believe In Israel charter.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/05/08/labour-mp-say-sorry-creating-israel/"}
