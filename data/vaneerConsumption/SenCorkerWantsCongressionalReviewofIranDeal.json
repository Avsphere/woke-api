Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, responded to the political framework agreement reached Thursday with Iran.\nHe said a nuclear-armed Iran would lead to a less secure world, and he wants Congress to weigh in:\nIt is important that we wait to see the specific details of today’s announcement, and as the P5-plus-one works toward any final deal, we must remain clear-eyed regarding Iran’s continued resistance to concessions, long history of covert nuclear weapons-related activities, support of terrorism, and its current role in destabilizing the region.\nIf a final agreement is reached, the American people, through their elected representatives, must have the opportunity to weigh in to ensure the deal truly can eliminate the threat of Iran’s nuclear program and hold the regime accountable. Rather than bypass Congress and head straight to the U.N. Security Council as planned, the administration first should seek the input of the American people.\nThere is growing bipartisan support for congressional review of the nuclear deal, and I am confident of a strong vote on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee takes it up on April 14.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/04/02/sen-corker-wants-congressional-review-of-iran-deal/"}
