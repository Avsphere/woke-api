The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nIn the heated debate over inequality, the wealthy are usually portrayed as the cause rather than the solution.\nBut CNBC's first-ever Millionaire Survey reveals that 51 percent of American millionaires believe inequality is a \"major problem\" for the U.S., and nearly two-thirds support higher taxes on the wealthy and a higher minimum wage as ways to narrow the wealth gap.\nThe findings show that—far from being a purely self-interested voting bloc—American millionaires have complicated views when it comes to the wealth gap and opportunity in America. They are unashamed of their own wealth and attribute their success to hard work, smart investing and savings. They also believe that anyone in America can get wealthy if they work hard.\nYet millionaires also believe that cultural and family issues prevent many Americans from climbing the wealth ladder. They advocate improved education, higher taxes on the wealthy and better savings incentives for the poor and middle class as important changes that would reduce inequality.\nThe CNBC Millionaire Survey polled more than 500 people with investable assets of $1 million or more, which represents the top 8 percent of American households. The respondents came from around the country and were split between Democrats, Republicans and Independents.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/raise-taxes-fix-wealth-gap-millionaires-say-n97941"}
