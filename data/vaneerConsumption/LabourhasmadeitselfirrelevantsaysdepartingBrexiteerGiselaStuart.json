The Birmingham Edgbaston MP said that Brexit will be the “defining issue for this generation” and warned the campaign so far lacked “precision”.\nGisela Stuart joined Boris Johnson and Andrea Leadsom for an EU referendum TV debate (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\nShe said: “This is the best opportunity since 1945 to renew our nation’s politics and society and it speaks volumes that at this moment Labour has made itself irrelevant. If we do want to be a party of government again, Labour must prepare for its own process of renewal.”\nMs Stuart said that while Prime Minister Theresa May was focusing on “strong leadership” during the election campaign, Labour can focus on the Conservative Party’s record on schools, the NHS and housing.\nHowever the party will need more than a “wish list and a collection of grievances”, she said. Ms Stuart also urged the leadership to resist the temptation to plan for a hung parliament and make pacts with other parties.\nAn emotional @GiselaStuart announces she will not be standing for reelection: \"I shall miss this House, more than the House will miss me\" pic.twitter.com/bLaDEqaFWm — BrexitCentral (@BrexitCentral) April 20, 2017\nShe said: “If Labour instead wants to be a party of government, it has to go into the election fighting for every vote. It must attack the Tories, yes, but it must also take a good look at the confidence and optimism voters feel about this country outside the EU and think hard about why Labour is not with them.”\nMs Stuart, who was first elected in 1997, announced she would not be seeking re-election at the start of the campaign.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-4446600/Labour-irrelevant--says-departing-Brexiteer-Gisela-Stuart.html"}
