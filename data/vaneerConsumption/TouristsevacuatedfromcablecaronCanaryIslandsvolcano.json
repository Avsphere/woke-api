She said no injuries had been reported.\nThe volcano's cable car operator said that a security lock was triggered automatically for unknown reasons on Wednesday, leaving more than 250 people trapped in two cabins.\nMore than half of them were evacuated by the end of Wednesday, but 111 in the higher cabin were accommodated for the night in facilities over 3,500 meters above sea level.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4319850/Tourists-evacuated-cable-car-Canary-Islands-volcano.html"}
