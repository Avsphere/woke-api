It will invest in projects at various stages of the development cycle, including late stage development, construction, and operation.\n\"By 2025 almost 27% of European electricity will be generated from wind and solar. As a major participant in Europe's power markets and as a significant investor in energy infrastructure worldwide, Vitol is keen to build a portfolio of renewable investments to complement its existing activities,\" Simon Hale, Investments at Vitol, said. Roy Bedlow, Chief Executive at Low Carbon, also commented on the new fund creation:\n\"At its core, Low Carbon is committed to tackling climate change and reducing carbon emissions through its long-term investments into the green infrastructure space. We firmly believe it is possible to provide all the energy we need through renewable sources, and this fund will help us further our ambition.\"\nVitol is the latest of predominantly oil-focused companies to have committed investments into clean energy.\nAt the end of last year, BP said it would invest US$200 million in Europe's largest solar development company, Lightsource, over three years for a 43-percent stake in the business.\nLast month, BP said it would buy the UK's largest electric vehicle (EV) charging company, Chargemaster, in the latest show of Big Oil's move into EV charging networks.\nLast year, Shell signed a deal to buy one of Europe's biggest EVs charging networks, Netherlands-based NewMotion. Shell has also partnered with a consortium involving some of Europe's largest carmakers to build a network of EV fast-charging stations across the continent.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-biggest-oil-trader-is-setting-up-a-renewable-energy-fund-2018-7"}
