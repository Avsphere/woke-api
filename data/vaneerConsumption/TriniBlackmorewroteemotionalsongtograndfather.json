Decided to post this to prove to her that she is actually pretty talented,' the mum wrote.\nThe enthusiastic praise from members of a Sunshine Coast community Facebook group should let the preteen pop singer know she's doing something right.\nA 12-year-old future pop star wrote a heartbreaking song for her deceased grandpa\nTrini Blackmore's mother posted the original composition online to boost the girl's confidence after the young singer felt out-shined by her twin sister\nBut Trini's dad said he hopes she will build self-confidence regardless of what others think.\n'We had a chat with her about that. Not everyone might like what you do,' Simon Blackmore told Daily Mail Australia.\n'More than anything, we want to make her realise that if she wants to achieve something in life, it's possible. There are ways to do things, but complaining will get you nowhere.'\nTrini's parents said she felt disappointed when she was recently placed in the back row at a dance performance, while her sister was put up front.\nPlaying the ukulele and writing songs became a way to boost her self-esteem, her father said.\n'Trini's grandfather passed away, and she decided to put her thoughts into song.'\nTwins Trini and Madi Blackmore, pictured, have been avid ukulele players since December\n'She has only been playing since December, when she and her twin sister got ukuleles together.'\nThe sisters have a chord chart on the wall in their bedroom that they use to practice the four-string instrument, Mr Blackmore said.\nTheir favourite artists include Taylor Swift and Adele - and Trini seems to channel some of the latter's melancholy pop sensibilities in her song.\n'Fantastic!! Keep the talent flowing little chick,' one gushing fan commented on the Facebook post. 'You definitely got what it takes to be a beautiful singer song writer.'\n'Goosebumps here!!! Extremely talented girl!!!!! Please make sure she keeps developing her talent in this field. Amazing voice,' wrote another admirer.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4299590/Trini-Blackmore-12-wrote-emotional-song-grandfather.html"}
