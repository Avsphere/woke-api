He had a specific list of students he then planned to shoot, including those who kept him from being in the study group.\nSheriff Warnke states that Mohammad planned more than he could accomplish. “He had delusions of grandeur,” the sheriff asserts. “I don’t think he had any actual capability to carry it out.”\nBreitbart News previously reported that Mohammad entered a classroom Wednesday morning and stabbed a male student. A construction worker, Byron Price, who was doing a remodel on campus responded to the noises of the attack and was himself stabbed by Mohammad while trying to intervene. Sheriff Warnke made clear that Price probably saved the first student’s life. Mohammad then fled the building and stabbed another student and a student adviser once outside.\nIt is interesting to note that Sheriff Warnke says there was “[no] evidence of mental illness” with Mohammad. That is an important point because the left typically explains mass public attacks as an outgrowth of mental illness, which require the passage of more laws.\nIsh Patel, one of Mohammad’s high school friends in Santa Clara, was surprised to learn of the mass stabbing. Patel said, “[Mohammad] was quiet, but he was really friendly. He was intelligent, too — he performed well academically.” He observed that Mohammad enjoyed basketball, going to the mosque to pray, and playing video games with his friends.\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
