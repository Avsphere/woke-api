He was best known for his role as dim-witted Trigger in the BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses.\nActress Emily Lloyd was seen enjoying a cigar as she was spotted in public with her one-year-old daughter for the first time. The 45-year-old strolled along the pavement towards a local park with her baby Arabelle\nTrip to the park: Her outing in East London (left) came a week before the second anniversary of the death of her actor father Roger Lloyd-Pack. Lloyd-Pack lost his long battle with pancreatic cancer on January 15 2014\nThe popular actor's daughter was seen strolling along the pavement towards a local park with her baby Arabelle in a pushchair.\nIt is the first time she and her baby have been pictured in public since her only child with singer Christian Jupp was born.\nShe spoke last year of her regret that Lloyd-Pack never got to meet the little girl.\nLloyd, who shot to fame at 16 in David Leyland’s 1987 dramady Wish You Were Here, told the Sunday People: 'Having children wasn’t anything I ever ­discussed with Dad but having something positive to focus on helped in some way after his death.\n'However, at the same time there is sadness that he isn’t here to enjoy her. Sometimes I wish I could share her with him but I can’t.'\nWhen Lloyd-Pack died at the age of 69 it was a devastating blow for his daughter. Lloyd, who acted alongside Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, saw her career struggle as she battled years of depression and anxiety.\nThe actress spoke last year of her regret that Lloyd-Pack (pictured together) never got to meet her little girl\nBack in the day: She is pictured, left, arriving at the Odeon Haymarket in central London for the premiere of David Leyland’s 1987 dramady Wish You Were Here and, right, attending the Cannes Film Festival\nActress: Lloyd (pictured in 1987) shot to fame at the age of 16 in David Leyland’s Wish You Were Here\nBut she spoke in May 2015 of how motherhood had helped her turn a corner and made her problems 'fade into the background'.\nLloyd, who was once diagnosed with mild schizophrenia and has needed specialist psychiatric care, said last year in the Sunday People interview: 'I have had my problems over the years but having a baby to care for puts everything into perspective.'\nThe actress was introduced to Jupp, who used to be the vocalist in the Flying Medallions, through a mutual friend. He later worked as a painter/decorator.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393905/Actress-Emily-Lloyd-enjoys-cigar-spotted-public-time-one-year-old-daughter.html"}
