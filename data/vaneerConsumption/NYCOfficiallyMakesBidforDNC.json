The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday officially offered up Brooklyn to host the Democratic National Convention in 2016.\nIn a letter to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, de Blasio suggested the event be held at the Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn, touting it as a “spectacular arena in one of the most dynamic and resurgent neighborhoods in our city.”\nIn April, the DNC sent letters to 15 cities, including New York, asking them to consider hosting the party’s presidential nominating ceremony. The deadline to apply was Friday.\n“The values of the Democratic Party -- inclusion, diversity, compassion -- are part of our city’s spirit,” de Blasio said. “We believe that this spirit can energize and captivate both the Democratic Party and the nation.”\n-- Andrew Rafferty","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/nyc-officially-makes-bid-dnc-n124861"}
