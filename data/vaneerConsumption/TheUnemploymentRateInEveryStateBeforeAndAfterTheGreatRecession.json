(While Georgia was not home to an especially large housing bubble, the state did rely heavily on construction jobs during the boom.)\nCaveat: The unemployment rate, as you probably know already, doesn't tell the whole story of what's happening in the labor market. It only counts people who are working or actively looking for a job. It doesn't count those who have given up looking for work, or who have retired. And the share of adults actively looking for work has fallen since the recession.","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/09/04/345796900/the-unemployment-rate-in-every-state-before-and-after-the-great-recession"}
