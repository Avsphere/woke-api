Not just black people too, because you see a lot of people within the Black Lives Matters organization that are white, Spanish, they are all dealing with the same type of hardships that are going on around the world and I think sometimes people don’t take the time to look into thing going on in the world.”\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/18/seahawks-de-michael-bennett-responds-to-teammate-shermans-black-lives-matter-comments-says-its-more-about-social-injustice/"}
