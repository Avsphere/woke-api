According to a recent Census Bureau report, Americans are 60 percent more likely to bike to work than they were over the past decade.\nDuring the years 2008-12, about 786,000 Americans pedaled to the office every day, compared to 488,000 in 2000. Still, despite the increase, bicyclists still account for less than 1 percent of all commuters. Just over 86 percent of workers still prefer the gas pedal of their cars.\nAnd while Americans are more likely to walk to work than bike, walking isnâ€™t seeing the same explosive growth as the two-wheeler. In fact, Americans are less likely to walk to work today than they were in 1980, that figure falling from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent.\nThe cities with the highest concentration of walkers and bikers combined are Boston, Washington, D.C., and Madison, Wisconsin. The South has the lowest number of both walkers and cyclists.\nAt the end of the workday, the Northeast loves to walk, the West loves to bike, and the South has little use for either.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/infographic-top-five-biking-to-work-cities-n119966"}
