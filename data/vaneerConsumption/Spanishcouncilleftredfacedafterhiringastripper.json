Using public buildings for private parties and showing us all their \"feminism\" by hiring strippers!'\nThe stripper went through her dance routine much to the delight of the (completely male) crowd\nThe sordid footage left viewers online outraged and council officials horrified\nAnother commented: 'Shameful. This is the way in which you defend women's equality. Hypocrites.'\nPolitical factions in Alcala have been outraged by the sleazy affair according to the Local Spain, with some decrying how the local municipal office had been 'turned into a strip club'.\nMiguel Angel Lezcano, the spokesman of the centrist political party Ciudadanos, said they want to know how much the party cost and who stumped up for the bill.\nThe council said they were working to find out the parties responsible for the embarrassing stunt\nHe said: 'It is unacceptable that this kind of thing happens in a town hall, which belongs to the people and is not a place for staging private parties.'\nCouncil sources were horrified after footage went public and have vowed to get to the bottom of the matter, however the pixelated video makes it hard to identify specific workers.\nOne local politician demanded someone take 'political responsibility' for the party\nIn a statement to local media the council confirmed the party had taken place.\nIt said: 'This incident happened outside of working hours in a municipal building. It's normal to permit retirement parties [in the building] for work colleagues.\n'In this case, the send-off devolved into a deplorable show.\n'The council considers these acts lamentable and inexcusable. It's since acted firmly and forcefully to find out the responsible parties'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319456/Spanish-council-left-red-faced-hiring-stripper.html"}
