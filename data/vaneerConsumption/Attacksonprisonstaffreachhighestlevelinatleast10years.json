Some 89 of the deaths were thought to be self-inflicted and 146 from natural causes.\n:: Reported incidents of self-harm were up by nearly a quarter (24%) to reach 30,706 in the year to September, with around one in 10 prisoners now self-harming.\nThe availability of so-called \"legal highs\" has been identified as a key factor in the surge of violent incidents behind bars.\nA report by the prisons watchdog last year concluded that new psychoactive substances are now the most serious threat to the safety and security of jails.\nPrisons Minister Andrew Selous said: \"These figures illustrate the problems facing the Prison Service. Reform is badly needed.\n\"Tackling violence and drugs must be our first priority.\n\"That is why we are introducing new measures like better detection so we can help ensure prisons become places of decency, hope and rehabilitation.\n\"We are also investing Â£1.3 billion over the next five years to transform the prison estate.\n\"Replacing old prisons with new will better support rehabilitation and design out the dark corners that facilitate bullying, drug-taking and violence.\"\nShadow justice secretary Lord Falconer accused the Government of being \"in denial about the crisis in our prisons\".\nHe said: \" It's shameful and utterly unacceptable that prison staff should have to face this level of threat in the workplace.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3420976/Attacks-prison-staff-reach-highest-level-10-years.html"}
