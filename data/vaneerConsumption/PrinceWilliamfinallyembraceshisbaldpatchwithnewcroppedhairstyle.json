'At last! Nothing worse on a guy than keeping thinning hair long. Accept the inevitable!' said one.\nThe Duchess dusted off the same outfit she had worn to the church on Christmas Day - a Michael Kors tweed suite, along with a Lock & Co hat, Aquatalia boots and Kiki McDonough earrings.\nHer mother, Carole, 60 â€“ who also joined the royal contingent - looked elegant in a mid-length skirt and boucle jacket with a fur stole and 'Jackie O'-style pillbox hat.\nMeanwhile, her sister, Pippa, 32, wore a grey coat over an extremely short dress, showing off her enviable tanned legs.\nJames Middleton, however, looked older than his 28 years with his by now familiar bushy beard, and slightly spoiled the family's scene-stealing appearance by slouching along with his hands firmly in his pockets.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge appear subdued as they pay their respects to those who were killed in the Gallipoli campaign\nThe Duchess of Cambridge is seeing curtsying the Queen after watching Her Majesty lay a wreath in memory of those who lost their lives\nThe royal couple helped mark the end of the Gallipoli campaign, which was launched in 1914 and advocated by William Churchill\nThe presence of Kate's nearest and dearest at church shows just how much the Queen has embraced them, in a way that the royal family hasn't done with previous royal brides.\nThe Queen is known to be fond of Michael and Carole, having invited them to dine privately with her at Windsor Castle and attend Royal Ascot, believing them to have handled the spotlight thrust on them by their daughter's marriage with 'impeccable dignity'.\nBut she also recognises her grand-daughter-in-law's closeness to parents and siblings to be a crucial component in the success of her marriage to William.\nYesterday, the entire Middleton clan filed into St Mary Magdalene Church after walking down in regal manner from the monarch's private home, Sandringham House with Prince Philip and William.\nThey did not, however, join the Queen - who was wearing a lilac coloured coat and matching - for her brief official engagement after the 50-minute service.\nInstead, William and Kate watched alone as the monarch and her husband paid tribute to the Sandringham staff whose deaths in the Gallipoli campaign in the First World War are still shrouded in mystery.\nKate looks chic in her winter suit as she smiles to waiting wellwishers after the Sunday service at the church of St Mary Magdalene on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk\nThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after morning worship at yesterday's service\nThe Duchess of Cambridge appeared sombre as she remembers those who lost their lives during the disastrous campaign 100 years ago\nA minute's silence was held in memory of those who lost their lives after the Last Post was played by a bugler.\nThe Queen and Prince Philip then stepped forward to place wreaths on the stone memorial,\nWilliam and Kate spent few minutes afterwards chatting to members of the Royal British Legion, old soldiers and the families of soldiers who fought.\nThe ceremony was a poignant one as more than 100 gardeners, gamekeepers, farm labourers and servants from the Sandringham estate fought in the ill-fated campaign as members of the Norfolk Regiment\nSeventeen of the staff including their senior officer Captain Frank Beck, 54, who was the Sandringham land agent, were listed as missing in action after an attack on Turkish troops on August 12, 2015.\nThe fate of the men became one of the enduring mysteries of the war and was known to have left the dowager Queen Alexandra and the Queen's grandfather, King George V, deeply upset at the loss of their workers, many of whom they knew personally.\nThe BBC drama All The King's Men, screened in 1999 and starring David Jason as Captain Beck, suggested that some were actually executed by Turkish soldiers.\nPrince William appears emotional as he and his wife Kate help remember those who lost their lives in the fateful battle 100 years ago\nThe Duchess wore her signature smokey eye make-up and rosy blusher for the occasion.
