Tuesdays was for yoga.\nParticipants often grabbed a post-workout coffee at the court's public cafeteria.\nThese days, the group of about 20 exercisers includes women in their 60s, 70s and 80s, with one participant in her 90s.\nO'Connor discussed her workout legacy during an appearance at the Newseum in 2012, six years after she retired.\n'I still have my class. It's still going on and I went this morning, as a matter of fact, at 8am, and it was good. That meant a lot to me, to have that class. That just really mattered,' O'Connor said.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (above), 83, has at least one core strength move in common with the O'Connor exercisers. They both do the plank\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor (above) has said O'Connor's exercise class met too early\nJustice Stephen Breyer (above) attended the class a few times but didn't want to be the only man, O'Connor has said\nMuriel Martin-Wein, 76, who has attended the class for years, said the women were \"all heartsick\" when they were told they would have to leave the Supreme Court building.\n'It was a real thrill. It made us feel special,' she said of being at the court.\nO'Connor's secretary, Linda Neary, declined to comment on the change, which was first reported by The National Law Journal.\nDega Schembri, who co-owns a gym in Cleveland Park, led instruction on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\nSchembri said the class will move to Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church on Mondays and the city's Eastern Market's North Hall on Wednesdays and Fridays.\n'I'm happy that we're able to continue something that she started,' Schembri said of O'Connor.\nThe class might still have been based at the court if O'Connor had been able to persuade another justice to attend. But she repeatedly struck out.\nDega Schembri led instruction on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at the Supreme Court\nMuriel Martin-Wein, 76, who has attended the class for years, said the women were \"all heartsick\" when they were told they would have to leave the Supreme Court building\nJustice Stephen Breyer attended the class a few times but didn't want to be the only man, O'Connor has said.\nDuring an appearance at the Newseum in 2012, Justice Elena Kagan, who worked as a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall from 1987 to 1988, remembered meeting and disappointing O'Connor back then.\nO'Connor encouraged the female law clerks to join her exercise class, but Kagan preferred playing basketball, The New York Times reports.\nLater, Kagan injured herself playing basketball and, on crutches, ran into O'Connor.\n'She sadly shook her head and she said, \"It wouldnâ€™t have happened in exercise class,\"' Kagan remembered.\nBoth Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined the court in 1993, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who joined in 2009, have said the class met too early.\nThat doesn't mean the current justices are uninterested in fitness.\nThree of them work out at the court using the same personal trainer. And Ginsburg, who is 83, has at least one core strength move in common with the O'Connor exercisers.\nThey both do the plank.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4300484/Supreme-Court-brings-gavel-OConnor-workout-class.html"}
