The fashionista's briefs provided a little more coverage in the latest snaps (left), compared with the tiny thong Kim wore in her unairbrushed images (right)\nThe Armenian American beauty's ample hips and heaving bust could barely be contained by the tiny Dior set as she made her way to the water's edge, while showing off her stunning golden complexion.\nKim's famous form was displayed in all its glory as she displayed her famously toned abs and ample rear in the designer two-piece.\nKim's head-to-toe bronze appeared to glow from within as the wife of Kanye West smiled, while wearing her raven extension-free locks in a poker-straight fashion.\nJ'ADIOR: Kim's blue Dior two-piece suggests the brand is going to be at the top of everyone's wishlists - she wore the same label just a couple of days before\nStarted from the bottom: The social media sensation hiked up her bottoms to reveal her dramatic waist-to-hip ratio\nTiny tweaks: The reality personality adjusted her suit to reveal the perfect amount of cleavage\nIt was her second Dior bikini of the getaway - this one did away with the underwire support and held up her assets with string\nMaking her way across the sand, the social media star looked down and adjusted her assets, first tugging at her bikini top before hiking up the bottoms.\nThe contrast between the Keeping Up With The Kardashian's star's narrow waist and womanly hips was exaggerated by Kim's gym flattened abs.\nThe mother-of-two's raven locks were chicly parted in the center to frame her picture perfect face, grazing her shoulders in their newly short style.\nAlthough the star's body was on exhibit, her prominent posterior seemed a little camera shy - unlike yesterday.\nKimoj-eez! Kim displayed her sizable behind in a thong bikini on Sunday after unairbrushed photos of her rump caused a small frenzy\nPutting it behind her: Unlike earlier in the trip, Kim didn't make a big show of her prominent posterior Tuesday\nUnairbrushed photos of the starlet's beach body caused a frenzy earlier this week, also garnering a fair share of criticism. But clearly Kim wasn't letting a few words meddle with her vacation.\nAfter complaining that her friends were 'fat-shaming' her Sunday, the starlet confidently doubled down by dressing her exaggerated curves in a barely-there thong and stepping outside.\nKim didn't seem to have a worry in the world as she bared her robust rump in its full, natural glory while she and her friends relaxed poolside.\nGirls overboard! Kim's older sister Kourtney also made a bold display of her body Tuesday, baring tons of underboob in a royal blue suit\nTuesday's body baring bonanza didn't stop with Kim, as sister Kourtney was also happy to strut her stuff in blue.\nThe mother-of-three displayed some very prominent underboob on the beach, donning a royal blue swim suit which had trouble containing all of her perky bust.\nThe suit's bottoms were equally revealing, showing off most of the new 38-year-old's bronze rump as she ran across the sands.\nKourtney's ab's looked lean as can be in her sporty suit, the result of the starlet's hard work with her personal trainer.\nHer suit dipped so low on bottom that the brunette beauty almost revealed her modesty.\nA sporty ponytail and retro-futuristic shades added a cool edge to top off the eldest Kardashian's beach look.\nThe modern mommies have been enjoying some well deserved girl time during their South Of The Border vacation.\nThe girls' weekend welcomed all of the familiar faces into the fold, including Larsa Pippen, Brittny Gastineau, Malika Haqq and Hrush Achemyan - all playfully dubbed 'The Calabasas mom crew,' by Kim.\nKim provided a 'play-by-play' for fans online, tweeting about the getaway as she, Kourtney and their friends spent some well-deserved time away from their children.\n'Oh @Kourtneykardash won't stop doing naked cartwheels,' wrote the starlet.\nAdding a word about herself, Kim slyly tweeted, 'Oh and as for me you ask? ...I'm just sitting here on the beach with my flawless body.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4446160/Kim-Kardashian-tries-bikini-photo-frenzy.html"}
