The suit alleged that the late Apple founder Steve Jobs was the mastermind of the scheme, emailing executives from Google with poaching complaints as early as 2005.\nLucasfilm, Pixar and Intuit rolled over in 2013 and settled their portion of the case for a total of $20 million.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/plaintiff-tech-anti-poaching-suit-asks-judge-reject-settlement-n103131"}
