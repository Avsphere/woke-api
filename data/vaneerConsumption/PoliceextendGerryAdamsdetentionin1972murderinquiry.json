The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nNorthern Ireland police have been given another 48 hours to interrogate Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams over a 1972 IRA killing.\nAdams' arrest over the killing of Jean McConville was among the most significant in Northern Ireland since a 1998 peace deal ended decades of tit-for-tat killings between Irish Catholic nationalists and mostly Protestant pro-British loyalists.\nNorthern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein member, defended his ally Adams.\n\"There is a cabal in the PSNI that have an agenda, a negative and destructive agenda to both the peace process and to Sinn Fein,\" McGuinness told a news conference in Belfast. Northern Ireland's justice minister denied the accusation.\n\"I believe Gerry Adams will be totally and absolutely exonerated and I believe that Gerry Adams will continue to lead this party,\" said McGuinness, a former Irish Republican Army (IRA) commander who only last month met Queen Elizabeth at a Windsor Castle in a sign of normalization since the peace pact.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/police-extend-gerry-adams-detention-1972-murder-inquiry-n95896"}
