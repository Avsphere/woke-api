Kevin Holbrook said.\nSomeone in the area called in the find, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation was called to help with the crime scene, he said.\n“An autopsy revealed foul play was involved in his death,” Holbrook said. “The heavy decomposition of the body has hindered our investigative procedures, so we’re asking for the public’s help.”\nHe said they are still trying to determine when Stinchcomb might have died.\n“We’ve got to go back and look at things like the weather when this level of decomposition is involved,” he said.\nPolice say anyone with information about Stinchcomb’s death should call the Criminal Investigations Division at 770-534-5254, or investigator Brad Raper at 770-535-3783.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/death-sugar-hill-man-investigated-homicide/OGHQoT12tkJAycjGEZkoQI/"}
