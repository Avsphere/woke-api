We have to support (such actions) if we are to prevail.'\nCounter-terrorism chiefs have urged others to follow the sisters' example.\nAnderson, 38, and Khan, 62, have been jailed for drumming up support for ISIS in London's Oxford Street\nThe pair from Luton, in Bedfordshire, had denied inviting support for a proscribed organisation and Anderson also denied possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist.\nA jury deliberated for eight hours before finding them guilty at the Old Bailey last week.\nSentencing today, Judge Stephen Kramer QC jailed Anderson for three years and Khan for two years.\nThe judge said their activities could have encouraged young people to be 'lured' to their deaths in Iraq and Syria.\nThe court heard motor mechanic and father-of-five Anderson had previous convictions for assault and possessing an imitation firearm while Khan, a driving instructor, was previously of good character.\nProsecutor Mark Seymour had told jurors the defendants spent two-and-a-half hours speaking to passers-by and distributing a leaflet on the 'so-called Caliphate' which had been re-established earlier that summer.\nHe said: 'These defendants, who both played their part as members of the group which invited support for ISIS in Oxford Street on August 9, 2014, would have been well aware that this is what they were doing.'\nAfter their actions were brought to light by the Muslim sisters, officers raided Anderson's home and found instructions for travel to Syria on a notebook computer.\nAnderson and Khan set up a stall outside Topshop on London's busiest shopping street in August 2014\nThe motor mechanic, who represented himself in court, appealed to jurors to 'see who I really am - a devoted father to my family'.\nHe said he only wanted to practise his religion and exercise his freedom of speech, adding: 'I have been brave enough to come and fight my corner because I know I am innocent and have done nothing wrong.'\nBoth were jailed for two years and Anderson was given an extra 12 month sentence for the material found on his computer.\nThey will be subject to anti-terrorism notifications for ten years.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422789/Ginger-extremist-jailed-three-years-setting-stall-London-s-Oxford-Street-drum-support-ISIS.html"}
