The property is situated within walking distance of the Esplanade and local facilities.'\nThe interior walls are covered in black dust following a blaze, which is believed to have happened in April 2011.\nFurniture is also scattered across the floors after vandals raided the building and the garden is littered with industrial rubbish.\nThe neighbour added: 'It needs somebody to come in and bring it up to scratch again, but nobody will pay that sort of money for it.'\nBurnt out: The interior walls are covered in black dust following a blaze, which is believed to have happened in April 2011\nA spokesman for Castle Point Council said: 'The property was fire damaged before the property came into the Council's ownership and is in a poor state of repair.\n'The council only has the legal power to sell the property to recover debts owed to us, with no legal power to bring it into the council's housing stock nor do any works to the property.\n'Once the debt is recovered the council is obliged to pay any other creditors the debts owed to them which are charged on the property and then any balance is given to the debtor.'\nThe council refused to reveal how much the council tax arrears totalled.\nMike Gray, from Dedman Gray, said there has been 'considerable interest in the property.'\nHe said: 'Everybody is working together to try and reach a satisfactory conclusion for all parties.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4301072/Council-house-sale-500-000.html"}
