She also noted that they did not seem intoxicated and were not behaving in an 'odd' manner.\n'The group said their goodbyes and Loor watched the men walk to [Hernandez's boat] but she did not remember seeing who was operating [the boat] at the time,' reads the report.\nThat was at 2:42am, 20 minutes before the boat collided with the jetty and killed all three men.\nInvestigators found that Fernandez and Rivero arrived at American Social, a Miami bar, around 1am and spent about an hour and 45 minutes at the establishment.\nFernandez bought two bottles of tequila, two vodka drinks and one gin drink according to the report while Macias bought three vodka drinks.\nAftermath: Photos taken at the scene of the crash in the hour after the boat collided with the jetty (above)\nLikely scenario: The incident summary report that aimed to recreate the events leading up to the crash featured a diagram of the men that placed Fernandez at the wheel of he boat (above)\nGrim look: Of the three men, only Fernandez's body was found underneath the overturned boat, with the other two individuals thrown from the vessel (boat in the daylight after crash)\nMiami-Dade Fire Rescue crews that responded to the scene sent in divers, who found trapped between the overturned boat and one of the boulders.\nThe other two men managed to clear the overturned boat, with rescuers finding them a but further away from the crash scene.\nMacias was submerged in a tidal pool next the jetty's surface and Rivero was submerged with his head and chest under a bolder.\nThey too were pronounced dead at the scene.\nThe bodies off all three men were pulled from the scene by 4:04am, less than an hour after the crash, and the rescue crew identified two of the victims as Macias and Fernandez to the Coast Guard at 5:16am based on driver's licenses in their wallets.\nFinal communication: Texts sent by Fernandez's girlfriend to Rivero just before the crash (above) say he was in a bad place\nThe rescue crew then passed the task of delivering next of kin notifications over to Miami Beach police, who also had to delicately try and ask the bereaved how many people were on the boat and the identity of the still unknown third victim.\nGiven the hour of the incident and the site of the crash scene, rescue crews believed there could have been other victims whose bodies were not discovered after the crash.\nInvestigators concluded in the reports that had Fernandez survived the crash, he could have been charged with multiple crimes including boating under the influence, manslaughter, vessel homicide, and reckless or careless operation of a vessel.\nThe report also included a text message exchange that night between Rivero and Maria Arias, Fernandez's girlfriend.\nShe told Rivero the pair had been arguing and asked him to take care of Fernandez, writing: 'He's been drinking and is not in the best state of mind.'\nFernandez' boat was named 'Kaught Looking,' but with a backwards 'K' in a nod to the notation made when a batter strikes out while not swinging at his final pitch.\nFirst sign: A text message exchange between Will Bernal and Rivero (above) that the former posted after their deaths suggested that Fernandez was driving the boat\nScene: The red pin above shows a Google Earth aerial image of the site of the crash\nThe report also states that Fernandez's mother Martiza was adamant in telling investigators the day of the crash that her son 'was always the driver' of his boat.\nShe also said she didn't know her son to be a heavy drinker or user of drugs.\nRalph E. Fernandez, a Tampa-based attorney who is a family friend, also was interviewed in a group setting with the pitcher's mother and several other relatives.\nHe said he knew the pitcher could 'throw 'em down' and wouldn't be surprised to learn he had been drinking that night.\nThe lawyer also described the pitcher as controlling and a 'hot head.'\nInvestigators also looked into, and debunked, Fernadez's contention that the pitcher could not have been driving the boat that night because he was aware of someone who was on the phone with the pitcher at the time of the crash.\n'He said this person heard Fernandez giving someone directions when suddenly he heard the crash occur and the phone went dead,' states the report.\nRalph Fernandez did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the accident report.\nHard stop: A look at the impact scene taken after the crash site was cleared by investigators (above)\nDestroyed: The damage sustained by the boat in the crash is seen in new photos (above)\nScene: Recovery efforts show a diver holding Fernandez's Rolex (left) and fiberglass (right) taken from the crash site\nInvestigators met with Yuri Perez, a South Beach club owner who claimed he was on the phone with Fernandez at the time of the crash. But GPS and phone records show Perez was on the phone with Fernandez 12 minutes before the crash, while the boat was still on the Miami River.\nAn autopsy concluded Fernandez and Rivero had cocaine and alcohol in their systems.\n'The presence of cocaethylene does confirm that alcohol and cocaine were consumed at the same time, from 15 minutes to 2 hours of most recent use,' concludes the report.\nThe report says it was calm and dark in Miami - with visibility at 10 miles - when the crash occurred.\nIn his four-year career, Fernandez was 38-17 with a 2.58 ERA and had 589 strikeouts. He was a two-time All-Star and the 2013 National League Rookie of the Year.\n'No matter what the report concluded, nothing will ever diminish Jose's everlasting positive connection with Miami and the Miami Marlins,' Marlins President David Samson said in an email.\n'Nor can it lessen the love and passion he felt for his family, friends, teammates and all his fans in South Florida and around the world.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4320222/Fernandez-probable-operator-boat-crashed.html"}
