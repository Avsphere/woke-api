The EPA also experiences a 31 percent cut, the biggest loser in the budget. The Department of Agriculture gets a 29 percent cut and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor are also cut by over 20 percent.\nAlthough there are over 13 percent cuts in the Department of Education, Trump’s budget proposes $168 million for charter school programs and $250 million for a private-school choice program, according to the Washington Post.\nThe Budget calls for the elimination of funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.\n“We are going to do more with less, and make the Government lean and accountable to the people,” read Trump’s message to Congress.\nThe budget outlines Trump’s spending priorities, but a more detailed document is expected to be released by the White House in May.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/03/16/donald-trump-budget-spends-big-on-military-and-the-wall-cuts-foreign-aid-epa-and-public-broadcasting/"}
