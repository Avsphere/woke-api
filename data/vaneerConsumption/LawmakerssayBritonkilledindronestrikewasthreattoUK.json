It was the first such drone strike acknowledged by the British government.\nCommittee chairman Dominic Grieve said Wednesday that intelligence assessments left \"no doubt that Reyaad Khan posed a very serious threat to the U.K.\"\nBut he said lawmakers still had questions about ministers' decision-making, because some documents were withheld from the committee. Grieve said that was \"profoundly disappointing.\"\nIn January, Attorney General Jeremy Wright said it is legal to kill militants overseas if they pose an immediate or unstoppable threat.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4448046/Lawmakers-say-Briton-killed-drone-strike-threat-UK.html"}
