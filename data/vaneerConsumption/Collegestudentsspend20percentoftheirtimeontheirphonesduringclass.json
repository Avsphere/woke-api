But technology also affords a view that can be distracting,' he added.\nMcCoy wants to someday answer the question about how youths can find balance as technology is on the up and up.\n'So the question now is, how we balance this out?\" he said.\n'How can we take in all the constructive dynamic benefits that this technology enables us to have, and then also be disciplined enough to recognize that there is a time and place to put it aside, and pay attention and stay focused?'\nThe poll numbers show an increase in use of technology since the last time it was measured in 2013.\nIn 2013, 30 per cent said they checked their device a minimum of 10 times a day back but the number rose to 33 percent by 2015.\nScott Campbell, a professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, told Health day he was not surprised.\n'Young people turn to digital media as an immediate way to relieve boredom and, sadly, the classroom is one of the environments in which they most commonly experience boredom,' he said.\n'Also, young people feel naked when they are cut off from their peer networks. Expectations for being accessible to others, and for having access to digital content, are very high these days. We may not always be thinking about it consciously, but it's there underneath the surface. The need to stay connected,' Campbellsaid.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3423447/College-students-spend-20-cent-time-phones-class-paying-attention.html"}
