Here he is pictured with his sister Lisa, who has campaigned for his release\nThe former paratrooper has now been sentenced to five years' jail on weapons charges in India\nMr Dunn's mother Margaret and sister Lisa (pictured) have campaigned relentlessly for Mr Dunn's release\nAmong those jailed are Nick Dunn, from Ashington; Ray Tindall from Chester; Paul Towers, from Yorkshire; John Armstrong, from Wigton, Cumbria; Billy Irving, from Connel, Argyll, and Nicholas Simpson, from Catterick, North Yorkshire.\nIan Lavery, Labour MP for Wansbeck, said he will continue to campaign for constituent Mr Dunn and the other five men who have gone through what he called 'years of hell'.\nMr Lavery said: 'This verdict will have come as a hammer blow to Nick Dunn and the other men detained in India coming only a matter of months after a court had quashed all of the charges.\n'The men and their families will be distraught at this news with all noises coming out of the courts in the last few days and weeks pointing towards them returning home in the near future after years of hell.\n'Sadly this bizarre judgment, charging the former British servicemen with the maximum penalty for handling arms, means the nightmare continues.\n'My thoughts this morning are with the men, their families and friends whose worst fears will this morning have been realised by the judgment.\n'I will continue to work with Nick's family to fight for his release and return to the UK and am seeking urgent discussions on the way forward and seeking an early resolution to this miscarriage of justice.'\nThey were working for US maritime company AdvanFort providing anti-piracy protection when their ship - MV Seaman Guard Ohio, which had a crew of 35 - was detained and weapons were found.\nIn the following months the charges were dropped, but the Indian authorities appealed against the decision and the men were detained in India. The authorities have now won their case.\nPaul Towers, a former British soldier among those convicted, said the weapons on board their ship were properly registered.\n'We are speaking to our consulate... this is not justice,' he said.\nBilly Irving, 35, pictured with his fiancee Yvonne MacHugh, was among those imprisoned by the Indian court\nMeanwhile, news of Mr Dunn's sentence has led to a flurry of support for his family on Facebook.\nIan Macbeth said: 'I'm so, so, sorry and my heart goes out to Nick and his colleagues. I'm so angry and upset of this decision and my thoughts are with you all of Nicks family and his colleagues' families.\n'I know this has just happened but my support to you is still strong. Love from an angry upset supporter.'\nGary Robson added: 'Disgrace. Five years. The British Government needs to get this sorted.'\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister David Cameron raised Mr Dunn's plight during a meeting with Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi on his UK visit.\nMr Irving is just one of six former British soldiers arrested and sentenced to prison in Chennia, India\nHe was released on bail from Puzhal Prison in Chennai in India in March, but was subject to strict conditions and was told he must remain in Chennai.\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Our staff in India and the UK have been in close contact with all six men since their arrest to provide support to them and their families, including attending court.\n'Ministers have also raised this case at the highest levels, pressing for delays to be resolved.\n'We recognise what a difficult time this is for those involved. There is now a 90-day window to appeal and we will continue to provide consular assistance. However, we cannot interfere in another country's judicial process.'\nMr Irving's partner Yvonne MacHugh, from Glasgow, previously started a petition on Change.org - which attracted the support of tens of thousands of people - saying the men had been 'wrongly arrested and imprisoned by Indian authorities while working to protect ships from pirate attacks'.\nShe has visited her partner in India and the couple now have a 10-month-old son together, whom he has met but not yet had the chance to get to know properly.\nMs MacHugh said her partner used to serve in the Parachute Regiment and had been working hard to make money for his family after leaving the Army.\nSpeaking on Monday, she said: 'After two long years of fighting to get my partner Billy home I'm devastated with today's verdict. For the next five years our son won't have a father at home.\n'Billy has passed on to me all of the evidence that we couldn't mention while the trial was going on. I intend to release this to the media so that the public can see that the boys did nothing wrong, that everything was legal and that this has been a miscarriage of justice.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393903/Six-British-pirate-hunters-jailed-five-years-weapons-charges-boat-seized-protecting-ships-Somali-raiders-Indian-Ocean.html"}
