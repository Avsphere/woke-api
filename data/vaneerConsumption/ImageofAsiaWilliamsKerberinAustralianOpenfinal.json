Williams took a four-month break after coming two matches shy of a calendar-year Grand Slam last year. It allowed her to refresh and she's been so dominant at the Australian Open this year, she's reached the final without losing a set â€” something she's never achieved in 15 previous appearances. Her fourth-seeded opponent admitted she couldn't do much. \"I was just standing there kind of watching her play,\" the Polish player said later. Angelique Kerber will be playing in her first Grand Slam final on Saturday against Williams, who will be aiming for her 22nd major title, tying her with another German, Steffi Graf. \"I will go out there, try to enjoy my first final, try to beat Serena,\" Kerber said. \"I must play my best tennis to have a chance.\"","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421095/Image-Asia-Williams-Kerber-Australian-Open-final.html"}
