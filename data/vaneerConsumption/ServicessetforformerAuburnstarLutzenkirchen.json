A visitation is planned before the service, beginning at 10:30 a.m.\nLutzenkirchen, 23, was killed in a car crash near LaGrange early Sunday. The one-vehicle accident happened around 3 a.m. at the intersection of Upper Big Springs Road and Lower Big Springs Road, the Georgia State Patrol said.\nAlso killed in the wreck was the University of Georgiaâ€™s Joseph Ian Davis, 22, of Dunwoody. Davis was driving a 2006 Chevrolet Tahoe with three passengers, including Lutzenkirchen, who was in the back seat of the SUV, GSP said. At the T-shaped intersection, Davis apparently missed a stop sign. The SUV barreled about 450 feet through a church yard and flipped over several times before coming to rest on its roof. Davis was partially ejected and Lutzenkirchen was completely ejected.\nTwo others were injured, the GSP said.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/services-set-for-former-auburn-star-lutzenkirchen/gTRWvhAwFV5bwHXfUcBWdL/"}
