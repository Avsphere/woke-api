The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nIn the wake of controversial lethal injections, executions are temporarily on hold in two states: Oklahoma and Ohio.\nNationwide, no one has been put to death since Clayton Lockett, whose April 29 execution was so badly botched the White House ordered a review of state protocols.\nBut three condemned men have been given execution dates for later this month. Here's a look at their crimes and their efforts to extend their leases on life:\nMarcus Wellons, Georgia\nWellon, 59, has been on Georgia's death row since 1993 for raping and strangling a 15-year-old girl who was abducted on her way to school.\nHis execution is set for June 17 â€” a date chosen shortly after Georgia's top court rejected a challenge by Wellons and other inmates to a state law that shrouds execution-drug suppliers in secrecy.\nIt's expected that his defense team will be filing more appeals.\nWellons' case has already been before the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2010 that a lower court had to review his conviction and death sentence amid revelations that jurors gave chocolates shaped like a penis and breasts to the judge and bailiff.\nA federal appeals court deemed the gifts \"tasteless\" but said they had no bearing on the outcome of the trial.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/lethal-injection/lethal-injection-three-men-await-their-fate-death-row-month-n122461"}
