How do you know the “solidarity was palpable” when you obviously weren’t there? pic.twitter.com/aglTgCtuAS — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) October 5, 2015\nSo you admit you weren’t there, but you wrote about the “palpable” atmosphere anyway. Wow. https://t.co/lVKekA5Dmt pic.twitter.com/dmtBN04iPf — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) October 5, 2015\nSimon did not explain when asked why Amber Rose Slut Walk organisers told Breitbart that the Slut Walk had 6,000 registrants but told TIME that number was 15,000. Merely a few hundred showed up for the march, from which this correspondent was ejected.\nTIME journalist now claiming Amber Rose said 15K registrants. They told me 6K. Someone is lying. Attendees? 250. https://t.co/5SmDyuB7fN — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) October 5, 2015\nLittle wonder: apparently, organisers prefer their journalists more impressionable and credulous. They call the cops when real reporters show up asking more difficult questions. At one point Simon attempted to blame an “editing error.”\nSo now you’re blaming someone else. Throwing an anonymous colleague under the bus. Who was it? Give us a name. https://t.co/S2urZZg8bG — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) October 5, 2015\nSimon describes herself on Twitter as a “speaker, writer, TV commentator, editor” and on TIME‘s website as “a strategist, cultural critic, speaker and media maker” whose work “focuses on communicating the personal values, ideas and habits that lead to radical social impact.”\nShe is a deputy editor for Upworthy.com and a “World Economic Forum Global Shaper” as well as a contributor to the TIME website.\nGiven the enormity of the gap between her estimate, which she claims was a figure of “registrants” provided by an Amber Rose representative, and the real number of Slut Walkers, Simon today become an object of ridicule on social media.\nWhat remains a mystery, though, even if we take Simon’s sloppiness and lack of fact-checking at face value, is why she invented colour about an event she wasn’t at. Why did Simon claim that the “solidarity was palpable and the energy electric” when she had no idea?\nYes—a mystifying coincidence! Somehow feminist events get 100x inflation, conservative rallies get numbers shaved https://t.co/b7dHrfcpBB — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) October 5, 2015\nThe alternative is just as damning: that Simon attended, but that she either purposefully misrepresented the number of Slut Walkers or, perhaps even more humiliatingly, can’t tell the difference between 250 people and 15,000. A feminist who can’t do math? Say it ain’t so!\nGiven who you follow, @createdbyerica, do you understand why this “error” looks suspicious? Even ideological? https://t.co/z8j019aIGX — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) October 5, 2015\nLast I’ll say: either Time’s @createdbyerica wasn’t there, and she made up detail & didn’t fact-check numbers, or she was and she just lied. — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) October 5, 2015\nSimon did not respond to further requests for comment.\nFollow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Twitter and Facebook.
