If it was like one or two that he was pushing in part of a larger deal. When you’re doing it as this massive attempt to rewrite the tax code and basically the president saying ‘it’s not going to be done unless we sort of do a redistribution in some way, you know we obviously have a massive income equality issue. Let’s do it with the tax code.’ I think philosophically it’s impossible to overcome the Republican hurdles on that front.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/01/20/todd-obamas-sotu-massive-income-redistribution-through-tax-code/"}
