This is a factor that has been extremely limited in recent years, despite the important evolution of the cars and subsequent increase in performance.\n'All these are vital steps towards tyre development that takes into account the future evolution of the cars and added performance, which will be particularly notable in 2017.'\nPirelli came under fire at last year's Belgian Grand Prix after Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel suffered high-speed blow-outs. Vettel claimed the tyre failure, which happened on the penultimate lap of the race, could have killed him.\nRed Bull driver Daniil Kvyat takes aprt in wet tyre testing at the Paul Ricard circuit in France this week\nPirelli has been Formula One's only tyre supplier since it replaced Japanese manufacturer Bridgestone in 2011.\nBut its remit to produce a fragile tyre which leaves drivers unable to push to the limit during races has attracted widespread criticism.\nBernie Ecclestone, Formula One's chief executive, is keen for that to change, and has urged as many of the sport's leading figures to attend the summit in Milan next week.\nSpeaking to the BBC, the 85-year-old said: 'Whatever drivers want to turn up can turn up. Whatever teams want to turn up can turn up. It will be the president of Pirelli who is there, not a messenger.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-3421967/Tyre-suppliers-Pirelli-set-crunch-talks-F1-chiefs-plans-faster-cars.html"}
