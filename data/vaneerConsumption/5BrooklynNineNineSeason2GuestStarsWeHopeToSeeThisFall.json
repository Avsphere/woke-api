We're officially less than a month from when Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 2 returns in a new time on Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Other than the \"owesome\" Season 2 trailer that was released last week, the cast hasn't revealed much about what we can expect during the upcoming season. Luckily, reports on who will guest star on Brooklyn Nine-Nine are trickling in, and things are looking good for next season. Jenny Slate has already been confirmed as a guest star on the season premiere, and Kyra Sedgwick is also on board. More recently, Terrell Owens filmed a guest appearance for BK 99, in which he will play a version of himself as a New York City firefighter.\nIn the episode, he’ll face off against Sgt. Terry Jeffords, played by former NFL linebacker Terry Crews, and the Nine-Nine precinct in an NYPD vs. FDNY pickup football game. The NYPD and FDNY will battle, hilarity will ensue, sports fans and comedy lovers will become one, and it will be a historic BK 99 moment.\nIn anticipation of the season premiere, and many other legendary guest appearances, I've compiled a selection of even more hilarious people would be amazing guest stars on Brooklyn Nine-Nine this season.\nAziz Ansari\nAziz Ansari just makes everything better. He's magic.\nLouis C.K.\nThis absolutely must happen.\nRashida Jones\nRashida Jones has acted with Andy Samberg before in Celeste and Jesse, and an episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine would be the perfect place to reunite the two.\nFred Armisen\nCan't Fred Armisen just be in everything?\nNasim Pedrad\nHer characters are amazing, and she'd be a hilarious addition to an episode of BK 99 that can double as an SNL cast reunion party.\nImages: FOX (1); Giphy (5)","url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/35475-5-brooklyn-nine-nine-season-2-guest-stars-we-hope-to-see-this-fall"}
