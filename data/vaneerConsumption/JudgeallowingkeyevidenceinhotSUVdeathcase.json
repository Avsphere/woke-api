(AP) — A judge is allowing prosecutors to use key evidence collected by police in the case of a Georgia man accused of intentionally leaving his toddler son to die in a hot SUV.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports (http://bit.ly/1KKERPy ) Cobb County Superior Court Judge Mary Staley ruled the state can use evidence from Harris' phone and computer. Attorneys for Justin Ross Harris wanted the judge to bar the evidence from trial. They say police went on a \"fishing expedition\" using overly broad warrants.\nPolice say Harris left 22-month-old Cooper in an SUV on a hot day in June 2014. Harris faces multiple charges, including murder, and has been held without bond since the day his son died. Harris' attorneys have called the death a tragic accident.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3423288/Judge-allowing-key-evidence-hot-SUV-death-case.html"}
