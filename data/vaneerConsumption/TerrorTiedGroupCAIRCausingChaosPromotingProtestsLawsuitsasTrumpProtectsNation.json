Kennedy International Airport. Saturday morning, two Iraqis were detained at JFK.\nOver 1,000 now at Terminal 4 at #NoMuslimBanJFK to say refugees and Muslims are welcome here! pic.twitter.com/NSBHt2KDut — Daniel Altschuler (@altochulo) January 28, 2017\nCAIR chapters were actively promoting the protests on social media and acting as spokesmen for the issue.\n#CAIR-Dallas: Immigration order halts travelers at DFW airport Alia Salem, executive director for DFW Chapter of… https://t.co/y82rUxjnxl — CAIR National (@CAIRNational) January 28, 2017\nABC News reports on the Chicago chapter of CAIR’s involvement:\nAt least one person was detained at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago today, and it is expected that she will return to Saudi Arabia, according to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Sahar Alghnimi, a Syrian woman who came to the U.S. on tourist visa to see her mother who had just undergone cancer surgery, was detained when she arrived from Saudi Arabia at 8:48 AM on Eithad Airlines, CAIR Chicago executive director Ahmed Rehab told ABC News.\nMeanwhile in Boston, CAIR is is planning another rally for Sunday at 1 p.m. on Boston’s Copley Square.\nCAIR-Massachusetts Executive Director John Robbins said Trump is playing on “religious bigotry and intolerance” and will end up turning away men, women, and children fleeing violence and persecution.\nTime magazine says that CAIR was behind a protest that happened earlier in the week at New York City’s Washington Square Park:\nThe demonstration, led by the New York Chapter of the Center for American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) was hastily organized in response to Trump’s executive orders restricting immigration from Muslim countries and efforts to curb undocumented immigration within the U.S. On Wednesday, Trump green-lighted the construction of a wall along the southern border, ordered the Department of Homeland Security to build more detention centers, and ended federal grant funding to so-called “sanctuary cities” that refuse to cooperate with federal anti-immigration efforts.\nCAIR has announced on their website that they will hold a news conference at its Capitol Hill headquarters in Washington, D.C. to announce the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the “Muslim ban” executive order. CAIR’s news conference will be live-streamed on its Facebook page.\nFollow Breitbart News investigative reporter and Citizen Journalism School founder Lee Stranahan on Twitter at @Stranahan.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/01/28/terror-tied-group-cair-causing-chaos-promoting-protests-lawsuits-as-trump-protects-nation/"}
