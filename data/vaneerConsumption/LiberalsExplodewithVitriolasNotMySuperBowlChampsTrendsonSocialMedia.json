Since that final touchdown the hash tag #NotMySuperBowlChamps and other similar tags have been trending.\nThe left-wing sports media has been out for blood for the better part of a year because Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and team owner Robert Kraft all came out as unapologetic fans of President Trump. And, now that they‚Äôve won the Super Bowl the left has turned apoplectic.\nSince last night‚Äôs big game, liberals have flooded Twitter, Facebook, and other social media services with several versions of the hash tag after Trump pal Tom Brady led his team to yet another Super Bowl title.\nAlong with #NotMySuperBowlChamps, users also employed #NotMySuperBowlChampions and #NotMySuperBowlTeam to attack the Patriots.\nThe winner should be determined by who has more fans, not more points.\nWinning is racist and Tom Brady is a fascist. #NotMySuperBowlChamps pic.twitter.com/ceMzrKTpb8 ‚Äî Elizabeth¬Æ (@MissLizzyNJ) February 6, 2017\nThe Patriots didn't win today.\nHate won.\nFear won.\nRacism won.\nSexsim won.\nHomphobia won.\nLiterally shaking. #NotMySuperBowlChamps ‚Äî Luis Antonio Miguel (@lamknight7) February 6, 2017\nA hashtag that I will use both before and after #SuperBowl51 ‚Äì #NotMySuperBowlChampion ‚Äî Douglas Young (@douglasyoung67) February 5, 2017\nTom Brady is a Trump supporter AND a cheater #notmysuperbowlchampion ‚Äî tom battles (@tomf0olery) February 6, 2017\n#NotMySuperBowlChamps Me: \"I hate the Patriots, Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and nothing can change my mind.\" Woke Twitter: \"Hold my beer.\" pic.twitter.com/hNtuDS2t48 ‚Äî ScottInSC (@ScottInSC) February 6, 2017\nDemand a recount!
