Harwood did not ask about Clinton’s emails.\nOther emails, including an invitation for lunch, appear more innocuous. Some look simply like pitches for interviews. Regardless, they reveal a close relationship between Harwood and Podesta — and apparent political support from Harwood.\nOn Jan. 28, 2016, for example, Harwood emailed Podesta to report that Clinton had done well at an event in Iowa: “She was good here in Newton.”\nAnd on March 14, 2016, Harwood emailed Podesta: “how are you feeling about tomorrow?” The next day, March 15, was an important Democratic primary day, when Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and North Carolina voted.\nClinton won all five contests — though by a narrow margin in Missouri and Illinois Harwood wrote again to Podesta: “Congrats – pretty strong.” Podesta then replied to Harwood in the early hours of March 16: “Yup. Feeling good.”\nRevelations from the Wikileaks email dump are ongoing — though the media have shown a curious reluctance to highlight them, focusing instead on leaked video of Donald Trump joking about groping women in 2005.\nJoel B.
