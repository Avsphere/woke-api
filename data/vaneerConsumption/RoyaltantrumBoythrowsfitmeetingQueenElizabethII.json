Instead, he wriggled out of his mother's arms and attempted to sit on the ground. Eventually his mom was able to pick Alfie up again and he reluctantly handed the queen the bouquet.\nThe 90-year-old queen is also a great grandmother and didn't appear fazed by the meltdown. She smiled at the boy and his parents throughout the encounter.\nMichelle Lun, left, holds on to her son Alfie, 2-years-old as they meet Britain's Queen Elizabeth II at the unveiling during the the unveiling of a national memorial honouring the Armed Forces and civilians who served their country during the Gulf War and conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in London Thursday March 9, 2017.
