PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was a creation of the CPB. It's most successful program is Sesame Street\nLOSER: The State Department, which is being slapped with a 28 percent reduction to its foreign aid division. Former Secretary of State John Kerry is pictured above with actress Angelina Jolie at a State Department event\nTrump is asking for $1.5 billion for his border wall this fiscal year and $2.6 billion in the next one\nThe blueprint does not deal with mandatory spending on entitlement programs such as Social Security or revenue sources nor does it try to balance the federal budget.\nDiscretionary spending, which came in at $1.1 trillion in 2017, according to Trump's Office of Management and Budget, is reduced by 13.6 billion in 2018, a 1.2 percent decrease that promotes fiscal responsibility and aims to 'redefine the proper role of the Federal Government.'\nIt will be up to affected agencies to figure out how to implement cuts, the president's budget director has said.\n'We've given them a tremendous amount of flexibility within their own agencies this year,' OMB Director Mick Mulvaney claimed Wednesday during a briefing for White House reporters.\nBudget Director Mick Mulvaney says the State Department will see most of its discretionary budget eliminated if Trump's has his way - but only because he wants to get rid of foreign aid\nSome administration priorities are very specific, however. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing a sizable cut intended 'to free up funding for critical priorities here at home and put America first.'\n'This is a hard power budget. This is not a soft power budget,' Mulvaney said of the appropriations. 'This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally. The President very clearly wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong power administration.'\nIn 2017, State received $38 billion in base discretionary spending. Most of that, $22.7 billion according to The Balance, went to foreign aid. That amounts to roughly two percent of the total allocation for discretionary spending.\nForeign aid will be slashed by 28 percent in FY 2018, if Trump has his way.\nA 2015 review conducted by NPR of foreign aid spending found that the largest share goes to HIV/AIDS programs. Economic development such as infrastructure building and Internet access, along with humanitarian assistance, accounts for another third of the money.\nThe blueprint that came out on Thursday said State should have enough money to maintain its HIV/AIDS and malaria programs at their current levels.\nMulvaney insisted on Wednesday that the reduction is not meant to minimize Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or his department - the foreign aid line items 'just happen to fall within their functions.'\n'We believe that we have protected the core diplomatic function of state, and that's why I say this is not a reflection of the president's policies regarding an attitude toward State,' he said. 'The president believes very strongly in what Mr. Tillerson is doing.'\nEliminated from the department is the Global Climate Change Initiative and funding for the Green Climate Fund. The administration is axing them as it fulfills a pledge to end payments to the United Nationsâ€™ climate change programs.\nGONE COMPLETELY The Trump budget includes a radical plan to get rid of 19 agencies in their entirety. They are: African Development Foundation Appalachian Regional Commission Chemical Safety Board Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Inter-American Foundation U.S. Trade and Development Agency Legal Services Corporation National Endowment for the Arts National Endowment for the Humanities Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Northern Border Regional Commission Overseas Private Investment Corporation U.S. Institute of Peace U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\nFunding for the UN is reduced altogether, including for peacekeeping operations, 'setting the expectation that these organizations rein in costs and that the funding burden be shared more fairly among members,' the budget document says.\n'The amount the U.S. would contribute to the UN budget would be reduced and the U.S. would not contribute more than 25 percent for UN peacekeeping costs.'\nUS Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Thursday that first cut was to overtime.\n'There was way too much overtime there, but then you look at the United Nations, the secretary general is new just like I am, and we both came together on the efficiencies that are needed in peacekeeping reform, which we've spent a ton of money on, and we've come together on management reform,' she said on the Today show.\nHaley added, 'We need Russia to step up and pay more, we need other countries to step up and pay more, we've carried the burden for a very long time.'\nExplaining the cuts to foreign aid in the budget, Trump said, 'It is time to prioritize the security and well-being of Americans, and to ask the rest of the world to step up and pay its fair share.'\nThe administration further tells State it must put $2.2 billion toward new embassy construction and maintenance and provide $3.1 billion for Israel's defense.\nThe slashing of the diplomatic division's budget had Sen. Lindsey Graham preemptively declaring Trump's budget 'dead on arrival' after the administration offered a preview two weeks ago.\n'It's not going to happen,' the Republican senator told NBC News. 'It would be a disaster.'\nHHS will lose out on 12.6 billion, a 16.2 percent decrease, if Trump's budget is approved in its current form by Congress\nGraham said the pared-down appropriations would put State Department employees at risk.\nHis concerns about the budget slashing were echoed by Republicans and Democrats that serve on the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee.\n'Foreign Aid is not charity,' Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said in a tweet. 'We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security.'\nTRUMP'S DEFENSE WISH LIST In his budget Trump promises to: Repeal sequestration Provide the needed resources to accelerate the defeat of ISIS Ensure the US remains the best led, best equipped, and most ready armed force in the world Rebuild the military by addressing insufficient stocks of critical munitions, personnel gaps, deferred maintenance and modernization, cyber vulnerabilities, and degraded facilities Offer up a National Defense Strategy to promote American superiority on land, at sea, in the air, in space and cyberspace\nDelaware Democrat Chris Coons argued, 'The aid we provide to countries around the world directly advances U.S. national interests by fostering a safer and more stable world.'\nMitch McConnell, the top dog in the Senate, is also against the steep State Department cuts.\n'The diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important and you get results a lot cheaper frequently than you do on the defense side,' the GOP leader told reporters, according to the Associated Press. 'So speaking for myself, Iâ€™m not in favor of reducing the (foreign aid) account to that extent.'\nCommenting on the coming assault on the State Department budget and other rumored chops, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican, told the Associated Press, 'Weâ€™ve reduced our discretionary spending over the last seven or eight years an incredible amount. Maybe some people donâ€™t like those agencies, but itâ€™s been pretty difficult for them to meet their mandate.'\nAfter the formal budget proposal came out on Thursday, Democrats heaped on.\n'This is a budget that is deeply destructive for America. It would gravely undermine our nationâ€™s long-time commitment to providing opportunity to all, promoting a healthy America, and protecting our environment,' said Michigan Rep. Sander Levin.\nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro said Trump's blueprint would 'decimate' critical programs.\n'With this budget, President Trump has truly betrayed the American people, including many of his most ardent supporters,' she said in an early morning statement. 'Congress must not enact this budget and we should do all that we can to fight for the most vulnerable Americans, not balance the budget on their backs.'\nTennessee Congressman Steve Cohen accused Trump of trying to send 'America back to the 1950s, a time which might be revered by President Trump but was not so rosy for women, minorities and low-income Americans.'\nSen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said the president was right to eliminate so many programs, however.\n'Trump should be commended for making some of the tough calls necessary to move our country in a direction of solvency, with the principle of federalism in mind,' the conservative senator said.\n'Also, while our intentions abroad are oftentimes noble, it is important to remember that we have many pressing needs at home. We should prioritize spending that will address these domestic needs, thus fulfilling our promise to put Americans first again.'\nTrump is proposing the dramatic cuts to some agencies so he can put $2.8 billion more toward immigration enforcement in 2018, $2.6 billion of which is being set aside for his border wall\nOne of the agencies Trump targets is the EPA. It would receive 31 percent less than it did before and a total of $5.7 billion in FY 2018 if Congress approves Trump's expenditures.\nTrump appropriates nothing to the Clean Power Plan, international climate change programs, climate change research or any related efforts. The OMB says the cuts will 'save' taxpayers $100 million.\nThe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the Chesapeake Bay, and other regional geographic programs are being defunded in order to lift the federal government's burden by $427 million.\n'The Budget returns the responsibility for funding local environmental efforts and programs to State and local entities, allowing EPA to focus on its highest national priorities,' the blueprint says.\nOn the chopping block more than 50 EPA programs that OMB says will free up another $347 million.\nThe biggest ticket item in Trump's budget is defense spending, at $54 billion.\n'The military has been forced to make aging ships, planes, and other vehicles last well beyond their intended life spans. The President will reverse this dangerous trend,' Mulvaney says in his introduction to the spending document. 'From rebuilding our Armed Forces to beefing up our border security and safeguarding our Nationâ€™s sovereignty, this Budget makes security priority one.'\nThe document goes on to say that Trump's budget 'provides the resources needed to accelerate the defeat of ISIS' and 'stop ISIS from posing a threat to the United States.'\nIt does that by funding efforts 'to strike ISIS targets, support our partners fighting on the ground, disrupt ISISâ€™ external operations, and cut off its financing,' the blueprint says.\n'DEAD ON ARRIVAL': The slashing of the diplomatic portion of the federal budget had Sen. Lindsey Graham preemptively declaring Trump's budget a non-starter\nTrump wants a $574 billion base budget for Defense and $65 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations for a total of $639 billion.\nThe Pentagon will get a $52 billion boost in the Trump budget that repeals sequestration. The other two billion he's requesting for defense is spent elsewhere. The Department of Energy will get some of the money, for instance, for nuclear energy programs.\n'This is a hard power budget. This is not a soft power budget,' says OMB Director Mick Mulvaney\nSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain had asked the administration to increase the Pentagon's base budget to $640 billion for a total budget of $700 billion.\n'With a world on fire, America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3 percent more than President Obamaâ€™s budget,' he said after the budget preview came out. 'We can and must do better.'\nAlso on Thursday, the president submitted a request to Congress that asks for revisions to the 2017 budget. Trump made a $30 billion request for Defense and a $3 billion ask for border security for the current fiscal year that would allow him to jumpstart construction on his fencing structure.\nTrump is also proposing $1.5 billion for construction of his proposed border fence this year, and $2.6 billion in 2018.\nOf the appropriation, Mulvaney said, 'It's all that we think that we can spend this year.\n'The next question is going to be, how many miles of wall does that build, right? And we donâ€™t know the answer to that question because we havenâ€™t settled on construction types,' he revealed. 'We havenâ€™t settled on where weâ€™re going to start.\n'I think the funding provides for a couple of different pilot cases...different kinds of barriers in different kinds of places, as we try and find the most cost-efficient, the safest, and also the most effective border protections. They may be different in different areas,' he stated.\nMulvaney said Trump's full FY 2018 budget, slated for May, will include 10-year cost projections for the wall the president has said will be paid for one way or another by Mexico.\nFor now, the money will come out of the general Treasury.\n'We did not say, we need $1.5 billion for the wall, letâ€™s go over and reduce this program over at education, and move that $1.5 billion over to the wall. We dealt with it more holistically,' Mulvaney explained.\nCut the deepest is the State Department, which is being slapped with a 28 per cent reduction to its foreign aid division\n'We plussed-up the various items I've talked about, and then we went looking for the most inefficient, most wasteful, most indefensible programs in other areas. So you couldnâ€™t follow it dollar for dollar.'\nOverall, the Department of Homeland Security is slated to get close to a seven percent increase in federal funds next year for a total of $44.1 billion in discretionary funds.\nThat includes $314 million for the 500 new Border Patrol Agents that Trump has ordered and 1,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and personnel and $15 million for the mandatory implementation of the E-Verify workforce program.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will have its budget cut by $667 million in the process.\nPrograms being cut 'are either unauthorized by the Congress' or 'supplanting other stakeholdersâ€™ responsibilities,' the budget blueprint says.\nTSA is also being knocked down a rung, receiving $80 million less than in did in 2017 to bring about the end of 'unauthorized and underperforming programs...in order to strengthen screening at airport security checkpoints.'\nRep. Nita Lowey, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committees, said Trump's request for funding for the border wall is a 'nonstarter.'\n'It would be a multi-year, multi-billion dollar boondoggle. This unjustified request is based on nothing more than a campaign promise,' she said in a statement responding to his ask.\nHis budget also calls for a $1.4 billion uptick in funds for private and public school choice, but only after a $9 billion, 13 percent, decrease in overall funds for the Department of Education.\nThe administration had been vague about National Institute of Health funding for studies on disease prevention - an area that Democrats have laced into the administration over.\n'The same time heâ€™s talking about medical research heâ€™s going to slash it,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at the end of February. 'Education. He talked about the great issue of education. Same thing. His budget is going to slash education to smithereens.\nSidelined: Mulvaney said Trump's budget is not meant to minimize Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or his department - the foreign aid line items 'just happen to fall within their functions'\nThe budget revealed a $5.8 billion reduction in spending to $25.9 billion that it says will 'help focus resources on the highest priority research and training activities.'\nIn addition to agency eliminations and consolidations, Trump's budget purports to 'reduces administrative costs and rebalance Federal contributions to research funding.'\nGetting more money are veterans. The VA is only department that is seeing an increase other than DHS and Defense. A $4.4. billion, six percent increase is on the books for department, bringing its total discretionary funding up to $78.9 billion.\nThe money is appropriated to an improvement in access to medical care and social services for the nation's veteran population.\nThe Energy Department is losing $1.7 billion and has been ordered to appropriate another $120 million to licensing for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, a program that was put on hold in the Obama administration.\nTrump wants a total of $1.4 billion more to go to the National Nuclear Security Administration, an 11 percent increase over FY 2017.\nOne major agency receiving a diminution was NASA. It will have a $19.1 billion budget after a reduction of nearly one percent.\n'But a lot of the programs within there are actually increased in order to align with the Presidentâ€™s priorities, and that includes some of the exploring other planets,' Mulvaney said.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is losing $250 million from the Commerce Department for grants and programs that support coastal and marine research and education.\n'These programs are a lower priority than core functions maintained in the Budget such as surveys, charting, and fisheries management,' the administration explains.\nPublic broadcasting funding will eventually be brought down to zero, as well.\nSome amount of public broadcasting money is 'necessary' for now 'for us to unwind our involvement with the CPB,' he sad.\n'So you won't see a zero next to it. But the policy is that we're ending federal involvement with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.'\nBy next year the line item might be zero, he added. 'But it may take a while to unwind that relationship. It's just the nature of contracts and so forth.'\nThe CPB's funding is relatively minuscule compared to how much Trump is proposing to spend annually on other programs.\nAt $445.5 million, it's a fraction of discretionary spending and will barely help Trump achieve his wish list.\nHe also terminates funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, closer to $300 million.\nThe Internal Revenue Service notably incurs the wrath of Trump, with a funding reduction of $239 million that accounts for almost half of the $519 million in cuts he wants to make to Treasury's budget.\nHUD is slated for reductions, as well. Trump is requesting $40.7 billion from Congress for HUD discretionary funding, a $6.2 billion and 13.2 percent decrease from the current fiscal year.\nAt the Wednesday briefing Mulvaney contended that 'a lot' of the 'wasteful programs, duplicative programs, programs that simply donâ€™t work' fall under that department's purview.\n'We've spent a lot of money on Housing and Urban Development over the last decades without a lot to show for it,' the Cabinet official stated. 'Certainly there are some successes, but there's a lot of programs that simply cannot justify their existence, and that's where we zeroed in.'\nMulvaney said the Department of Transportation's discretionary spending budget is being reduced for the same reason. It's gross budget is being cut by $2.4 billion, or 13 percent.\nAmong the things funded by the Department of Transportation are Amtrak, the national passenger railroad, and subsidies for airports and interstates.\nTrump's budget ends funding for Amtrakâ€™s long distance trains 'which have long been inefficient and incur the vast majority of Amtrakâ€™s operating losses' and refocuses the transportation provider on state-supported and Northeast Corridor train services.\nThe Department of Justice is getting $27.7 billion for the Department of Justice, $1.1 billion less than it spends currently, which amounts to a 3.8 percent decrease.\nAt the same time, Trump also wants DOJ to spend $249 million, or 3 percent, more on counterterrorism, counterintelligence and federal law enforcement activities within the FBI.\nHe also specifies that the agency should spend $9 million more annually than it does presently on background checks for firearms purchases and its data tracking of violent crime in certain cities and communities.\nTrump additionally calls on DOJ to spend $175 million more than it does right now to 'target the worst of the worst criminal organizations and drug traffickers in order to address violent crime, gun-related deaths, and the opioid epidemic.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4319866/Trump-calls-cuts-pay-wall-defense.html"}
