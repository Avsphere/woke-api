He took them past a faltering Madrid and on to the league title, finishing with 43 goals.\nHe finished five short of Ronaldo but Messi was the more decisive of the two. Ronaldo scored in the crucial second Clasico of the season but Messi's free-kick had made the first Barcelona goal for Jeremy Mathieu – he would end up with 18 assists for the season. No one would finish with more. He had also set the tone with an audacious nutmeg of Madrid's Toni Kroos. He was the magic and momentum of Barca's Liga campaign.\nIn the Champions League it was the same story – Ronaldo shared top-scorer billing with Messi and Neymar but it was the latter two who danced around the pitch at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on June 6.\nMessi (right) has been deadly alongside Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar for Barcelona\nMessi had an extraordinary year and it is set to be recognised on Monday night at the Ballon d'Or ceremony\nMessi is poised to win his fifth Ballon d'Or trophy ahead of team-mate Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo\nBefore Bayern Munich met Barca in the Champions League semi-final, Pep Guardiola had called Messi 'impossible to stop'.\nHe did not fall short of that pre-match billing, scoring twice as Barca established a 3-0 lead that would take them to the final – 2015 was perhaps the year when when we began to wonder if the incredible things Guardiola and Messi achieved together had not been more the work of the Argentine than the Catalan. Messi won the Treble with Pep in 2009; now he has won it without him.\nTo complete that hat-trick of major trophies Barcelona won the Copa del Rey beating Athletic Bilbao in the final. This was perhaps the trickiest of the three titles. Athletic are tough opponents as they proved at the start of this season by beating Barca in the Spanish Super Cup.\nMessi, pictured holding the Ballon d'Or trophy in January 2013, is set to win his fifth on Monday night\nMessi won La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey with Barcelona in a fantastic year\nThe game may have gone their way had Messi not scored quite possibly the goal of the season anywhere in Europe, bursting from a starting position on the right touchline just inside his own half, past four Athletic players before converting at such a pace that team-mate Luis Suarez deserved an assist for the speed at which he had managed to get out of the way of the shot.\nRonaldo's incredible scoring consistency is to be admired. It was a spectacular year for Neymar. And Suarez is unlucky not to be on the podium. But the prize must go to Messi again.\nIn 2015 Guardiola called Messi 'the greatest of all time' and his fifth Ballon d'Or will underline the fact that his assertion now feels almost indisputable.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3393476/Lionel-Messi-extraordinary-season-standards-Barcelona-superstar-deserves-fifth-Ballon-d-Or.html"}
