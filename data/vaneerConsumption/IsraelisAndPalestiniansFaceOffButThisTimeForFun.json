They required no special security.\nThe status of Jerusalem is among the most contentious issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nPalestinians view east Jerusalem as their future capital, while Israelis see the entire city as theirs.\nIsrael occupied east Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community, which has expressed alarm over the expansion of Jewish settlements there.\nWednesday’s games were held in an area along the line between mainly Palestinian east and mostly Jewish west Jerusalem, at an Ottoman-era train station now home to bars and restaurants.\nWhile Israelis and Palestinians live side-by-side in Jerusalem, there is very little mixing and constant tension. Any true coexistence remains a far-off dream.\nBut events like Wednesday’s backgammon tournament can provide a break from ever-present passions in a city holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims.\nIt was a group of young Palestinian and Israeli activists that decided to make a play at temporary peace with one of the world’s oldest board games.\nThey called it “Jerusalem Double” — a reference to when a player ups the ante of points and forces his opponent to match or concede.\nVeiled Palestinian women, ultra-orthodox Jews wearing black yarmulkes, families pushing strollers and excited children gathered to watch at the train station.\n“You know, for many people, this is the most interaction that they will have with an Arab or a Jew,” said Zaki Jamal, a Jewish man and one of the organisers.\n– Play fights –\nMahmud al-Rifai, a Palestinian organiser, said that 150 people attended on the first night, while even more were at the second.\nHe said it included those who spoke of what they described as the good old days — perhaps with the help of an overly generous memory — when Jews, Muslims and Christians mingled more easily.\n“The situation is not what the politicians try to sell to us,” he said. “Look at how much Jerusalem residents want something like this.”\nIn Arabic and in Hebrew, the game is called “shesh besh,” mixing Turkish and Persian to say “6” and “5”, as well as “tawle” for the Palestinians.\nIt’s a popular game among men who gather at cafes from the West Bank city of Ramallah, the Palestinian political capital, to Tel Aviv, Israel’s seaside commercial centre.\nTournament organisers realised that the Palestinians played a variation called “mahbussa,” unknown to Jewish players.\nThe Israelis clear the checkers when they reach the edge of the board, while Palestinians stack them.\nThe difference — perhaps symbolically — caused endless lighthearted disputes between Abud and Mehri.\nOne volunteer proposed to mediate, leading the two men to break out in laughter.\nFor organiser Jamal, “there is something with backgammon that brings different people here — not only the usual peace activists, but also people who have no desire to talk about politics.”\n“I think that we have put our finger on something,” he said.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/09/01/israelis-palestinians-face-off-time-fun/"}
