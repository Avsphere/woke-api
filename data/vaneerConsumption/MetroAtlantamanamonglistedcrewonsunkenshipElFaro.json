Officials say the shipâ€™s captain had plans to go around the storm as he headed to Puerto Rico but the El Faro suffered unexplained engine failure that left it unable to avoid the storm.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.\nThe Coast Guard located a deceased person in a survival suit in the water Sunday night. A heavily damaged life boat with markings consistent with those on board the El Faro were also located Sunday. Additional items located by search crews since Thursday include a partially submerged life raft, a survival suit, life jackets, life rings, cargo containers, Styrofoam, packaged food and an oil sheen.\nCrew members came from mainly from Florida.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/metro-atlanta-man-among-listed-crew-sunken-ship-faro/CgEo8F8zSfcsS4QhrCnfPO/"}
