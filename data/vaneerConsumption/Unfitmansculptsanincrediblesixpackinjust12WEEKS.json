Pictured left before and right, after his 12-week programme\nMatt said moving the move from his home in Winsford, Cheshire, three years ago was 'a massive shock to the system' and his lifestyle began to suffer as a result.\nMatt initially found himself gaining weight as he struggled to adapt to his new life in the City.\nHe said: 'I was not a slim child and I had gone through a lot of effort in the past to lose weight so I did not want to fall into old habits.\n'I got a new job with a new employer, in an area I really wanted to work in, and in a much better location. I decided that this should be a fresh start, and put all the past stress and weight gain behind me.'\nAfter moving to London, he switched departments to avoid the threat of redundancy.\nMatt says he began to gain weight at an increasingly rapid rate as his long hours led to a poor diet and no time for fitness.\nMatt found himself relying on shop-bought sandwiches for lunch and quick, easy meals like breaded chicken and chips and his body fat soared to 22 per cent leaving him with an untoned body, pictured\nOn the 12-week plan Matt stopped eating lunchtime sandwiches and chicken and chips, instead making protein-loaded meals like chicken breast and broccoli and salmon, sweet potato and spinach. He managed to get the 'six-pack body' he'd always dreamed of, pictured\nMatt found himself relying on shop-bought sandwiches for lunch and quick, easy meals like breaded chicken and chips and his body fat soared to 22 per cent.\nHe said: 'My new role was not located near any gyms and I was working much longer hours than previously so I did not have the time or motivation to exercise at home.\n'This, paired with eating out a lot more in the daytime and being poorly timed with the Christmas holidays, meant that I put on a fair amount of weight in a short period of time.'\nMatt joined Embody Fitness, a personal training and body transformation studio in Bank, London last year and weighed 11st 5lb.\nHe said: 'Even after previous weight loss efforts, I had never in my life achieved a \"six-pack body\" and I really wanted to see if I could achieve it in time for summer, as it always seemed too good to be true.'\nAfter undergoing a mandatory assessment process, comprising of a physical screening and lifestyle questionnaire, the team drew up a bespoke training plan and diet for Matt.\nHe would eat steak for breakfast and worked out intensely to achieve his new physique. Three times a week he would do intense workouts including bench presses and cable flys with dumbells, which resulted in him shedding 75 per cent of his body fat\nMatt said he is now 'loving' the city life and now weighs 10st 5lb - after slimming from 11st 5lb. He has since changed jobs to avoid falling back into old habits and is now a keen dancer\nHe underwent an intense 12-week training programme from May to August, drawn up specifically for him after a detailed physical and nutritional assessment.\nMatt stopped eating lunchtime sandwiches and chicken and chips, instead making protein-loaded meals like chicken breast and broccoli and salmon, sweet potato and spinach - while also eating steak for breakfast instead of his usual Crunchy Nut.\nHe stopped snacking on chocolates and instead began eating nuts between meals and taking protein shakes.\nMATT'S EXERCISE REGIME Four sets of each, with two minutes of rest in between: Eight flat benches Eight incline benches 16 cable flys Eight seated rows Eight narrow grip pull ups 16 lateral pull overs\nThree times a week he would do intense workouts including bench presses and cable flys with dumbells, which resulted in him shedding 75 per cent of his body fat.\nMatt said he is now 'loving' the city life and his ripped body - which is has stabilised at 10st 5lb.\nHe has since changed jobs to avoid falling back into old habits and is now a keen dancer.\nLooking back, Matt believes his problems started shortly after taking up work in London, when he decided to switch departments.\nDetermined to adjust his unhealthy lifestyle, Matt took the brave decision to change jobs on his own terms and made sure he wasn't left with limited access to fitness facilities as before.\nMatt also praised his personal trainer for the quick transformation. He said: 'My trainer, Dave, was fantastic.\n'He made sure I stayed on track and I ended up sticking to the diet and exercise plan for him as much as me in the end.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3390124/Unfit-man-sculpts-incredible-six-pack-just-12-WEEKS-working-three-times-week-eating-steak-breakfast.html"}
