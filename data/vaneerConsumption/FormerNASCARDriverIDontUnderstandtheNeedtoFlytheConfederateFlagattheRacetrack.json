Why can’t you spend your money on a Jeff Gordon flag? Kevin Harvick flag? Jimmie Johnson flag? At a racetrack, show your allegiances to those drivers. That makes sense to me. I wasn’t born in the Deep South, maybe that’s the difference.”","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/07/02/former-nascar-driver-i-dont-understand-the-need-to-fly-the-confederate-flag-at-the-racetrack/"}
