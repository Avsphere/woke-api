In order to release you need to crane your neck and walk tall.'\nMs Kenny said making a conscious effort to time your breathing as you walk and keeping your head up works wonders for your posture\nStanding out from the crowd: Ms Kenny has been modelling for 40 years now\nWorking with professional makeup artists and hair stylists for almost half a century has certainly rubbed off on the 58-year-old.\nShe recommends putting shampoo into your hair before it's wet and then rinsing it out in the shower.\n'Oh absolutely. Shampoo before you get into the shower, massage it in, and then rinse. Then do your shampoo and conditioner as normal,' Ms Kenny said.\nShe also does olive and coconut oil treatments for her greying hair to 'lock the moisture in'\nShe also does olive and coconut oil treatments for her greying hair to 'lock the moisture in'. Ms Kenny said she might leave it in for a few hours if she's in a rush but otherwise she'll just have it in for days.\n'You can put oils on your face as well.

You have to be everything all at once,' she said.\nThe focus on weight in the industry is enough to make Ms Kenny 'really angry' as she says lots of other occupations require a weight limit\nAs for the focus on weight in the industry, Ms Kenny said it 'makes her angry'.\n'Jockeys need to be a certain weight to compete. So do boxers. So why is there so much focus on models? Of course they have to be a certain weight or have certain measurements.

But stretching makes it easier,' she said.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4318856/Lou-Kenny-58-reveals-tips-ageing-gracefully.html"}
