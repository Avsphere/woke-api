There was not one bit of intensity from me.\"\nRelief came in the form of audience laughter at the film's midnight premiere.\n\"It was my first time watching it around a group of people,\" Posey said. \"I love the movie and I was ready to laugh, and everybody else laughed, too. It blew me away. It made me so happy.\"\nPosey, Butler and Long partied alongside producers and fans of the film at the Kia Supper Suite this week, where Los Angeles restaurant The Church Key provided the snacks and jewelry company Stella & Dot provided the bling.\nThe party also featured an unexpected reunion of Jay and Silent Bob, the movie characters originated by Jason Mewes and writer-director Smith.\nThe Sundance Film Festival wraps on Sunday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421958/Teen-Wolf-Tyler-Posey-shows-funny-Sundance.html"}
