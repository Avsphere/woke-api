Its economy has faltered in part due to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank.\nIt relies heavily on Israel for electricity supplies.\nThe IEC has since March 31 reduced power supply for hours at a time to Jericho, Bethlehem and Hebron, causing blackouts that Palestinian officials said threatened to cause further economic damage.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/04/06/israel-says-deal-reached-halt-rolling-blackouts-west-bank/"}
