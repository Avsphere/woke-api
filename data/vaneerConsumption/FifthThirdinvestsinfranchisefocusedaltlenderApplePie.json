According to the WSJ, Fifth Third is also considering the purchase of ApplePie's loans.\nApplePie caters exclusively to people opening franchises of chains. It offers loans starting at $100,000 across all 50 states to entrepreneurs who want to open new franchise locations, as well as refinancing for existing locations to allow owners to open more stores. The loans are funded by both institutional investors such as brands and individual investors, with individual investors promised returns of 7-12%.\nThere are a number of reasons business-focused alt lenders might be having more luck than their consumer-facing peers right now:\nThey are focusing on an underserved market. The average loan ApplePie extends to franchisees, roughly $420,000, is too small for banks to profitably issue, making it hard for these business owners to access capital. This is a pain point felt by many small business owners â€” as of late 2015, only 49% of small business loan applicants received loans from large banks, resulting in roughly $96.5 billion of unfulfilled small business loan demand in the US in Q4 2015.\nThey are operating in a less high profile, less crowded space.Scandals at Prosperand Lending Club have been partly responsible for consumer lenders' recent struggles to attract capital, an issue it seems business-focused lenders have been able to avoid. Another business-focused lender, OnDeck, also received funding this week. In addition, the small business alt lending segment in the US is far smaller than the consumer segment by participants, which means less competition, and therefore likely less expenditure on customer acquisition and retention.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/fifth-third-invests-in-franchise-focused-alt-lender-applepie-2016-12"}
