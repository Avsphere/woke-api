Today, America’s farmers feed not only our nation, but millions of people around the world.”\nTrump signed an executive order to establish a task force, which would investigate federal rules and regulations that were restricting the farming industry.\n“Our farmers deserve a government that serves their interest and empowers them to do the hard work that they love to do so much,” he said. “And that’s what today’s executive order is all about.”\nBut Trump focused more on his recent trade actions, particularly in response to the trade dispute with Canada.\n“People don’t realize Canada has been very rough on the United States. Everyone thinks of Canada as being wonderful, and so do I. I love Canada. But they’ve outsmarted our politicians for many years, and you people understand that,” Trump said, nodding to the farmers.\nThe president told reporters that he was not worried about a trade war with Canada.\n“They have a tremendous surplus with the United States. Whenever they have a surplus, I have no fear,” he said.\nTrump’s newly confirmed Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue was also present for the event.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/04/25/donald-trump-celebrates-farmers-white-house-defends-trade-actions/"}
