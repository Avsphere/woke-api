'I want to say thank you to everyone who helped that day, especially to that nurse.\n'She was a nurse and knew what she was doing. If it was somebody else who thought you could take out the knife, I probably wouldn't be sitting here.\n'And to everyone who didn't ignore it and got involved and helped to catch him, the witnesses who came as well, and police officers, they did a great job.'\nThe court heard that when Mohammed approached Ms Pranskuniene in the street on July 9, she phoned 999 but cancelled the call when he ran off.\nHowever Mohammed returned with a knife he had hidden nearby and stabbed her while she still had the phone in her hand in London Road, North End.\nThe blade (pictured) missed her heart by less than an inch and had to be removed by hospital surgeons after it became embedded up to the hilt\nCCTV played in court showed the moment he plunged the kitchen knife into her back, saying 'Why do you hate me? Why are you destroying my life?'\nStephen Parish, prosecuting, said 'Shortly afterwards - she puts it at a minute - she felt a huge bang in the back.\n'She felt numb and out of breath and she collapsed in a sitting position on the pavement.\n'She didn't realise that she had been stabbed until she was in the ambulance and there was in fact a knife in her back, embedded up to the hilt.'\nMohammed - who denied attempted murder - was seen at 8.58am leaving a drinks bottle behind the delivery gates at Sainsbury's, before the attack at 3.24pm.\nMr Parish said 'The significance of all that of course is that the prosecution says the defendant must have planned the attack well in advance.\n'He'd gone to Sainsbury's in the morning to hide the knife. He waits for Diana near the top of her road. When he encounters her he runs back to retrieve the knife and stabs her.\n'The location of the injury, the depth of the wound, is consistent only with an intention to kill.'\nMohammed ran across London Road between cars before he was confronted by members of the public in Derby Road.\nMr Parish said 'Darren Shuker heard someone say 'why did you stab her?' and the defendant said 'I kill her, I kill her', something along the lines of 'I'm better off without her'.'\nMr Parish said Mohammed had initially pretended to be his brother Hiwar Namiq, who was then also arrested.\nMohammed told police 'my brother told me to stab her' but he later admitted'I put the knife in.'\nMohammed, of no fixed address, was jailed for 19 years with a four-year extension on licence.\nHe had been examined at Ravenswood House, where a psychiatrist at first thought he suffered a psychotic episode in the attack - but later ruled he did not.\nJudge Sarah Munro said 'You were capable of manipulating the medical staff and influencing fellow patients - for example you knew which staff would accede to your demands for drugs and accused those who did not of being racist towards you.\nMohammed returned with a knife he had hidden nearby and stabbed Diana Pranskuniene while she still had the phone in her hand in London Road, North End (pictured)\n'You demonstrated violent and aggressive threats, even in that secure environment and at one point said that you aim to serve your sentence in bliss at Ravenswood rather than in prison.\n'At one stage you made a full confession to the crime, describing your anger towards Diana as being the motive.\n'You planned the attack and concealed the knife nearby while you hung around all day for your target to appear. You plunged the knife into her back, narrowly missing vital organs.\n'Your intention was to kill her and it's a matter of pure good fortune that you did not do so.'\nAnother defence lawyer, Pierce Power, said 'trauma' Mohammed suffered growing up in Iraq was 'intrinsically linked to what is otherwise a completely random incident of violence'.\nDet Supt Justin Norris said 'The members of the public in Portsmouth were brilliant, they really came together.\n'They went to her aid and having seen what happened, they chased him in order to make sure that he didn't get away with what he had done, which was a brave thing to do.'\nMohammed will serve two thirds of the term before a parole board considers him for release.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4447242/Iraqi-immigrant-stabbed-brother-s-girlfriend-week.html"}
