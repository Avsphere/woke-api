Supervisor: More Gun Control to 'Protect the Public'","title_rss":"NULL","source_domain":"breitbart.com","text":"In the wake of the July 1 attack in which illegal alien Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez allegedly used a stolen gun to shoot and kill Kathryn Steinle, San Francisco supervisor Mark Farrell is pushing a new gun control law that will require every gun and ammunition sale to be videotaped.\nThis law will increase the focus on law-abiding citizens who buy guns and ammo–as those are the kinds of transactions that will be videotaped–while completely ignoring the problem of illegal aliens in sanctuary cities using guns, acquired via theft or otherwise, to harm citizens.\nFarrell believes it to be a good idea. CBS San Francisco reports Farrell as saying, “Even though San Francisco has some of the toughest gun control laws on the books in the country – there is more we can do to protect the public.” He wants all gun and ammo sales to be videotaped, and he wants “all places where firearms or ammunition are stored, handled, sold, transferred, or carried” to be videotaped as well.\nA similar law is already in place in Chicago, where it was implemented in 2014, and homicides increased “19 percent” in the first six months of 2015.\nYet Farrell is determined. He says, “Easy access to guns and ammunition continue to contribute to senseless violent crime here in San Francisco and across the country.”\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
