From transgenderism to Black Lives Matter, from global warming to campus sexual assault, every hot button issue for the left received a turn on camera. And when one Republican appeared, the show seemed to stop for just a moment, before continuing on in its journey to leftist utopia.\nHere were the seven worst moments from the Oscars.\nChris Rock Goes Full Racist. After Rock’s choice as Oscar host, the black comedian received massive blowback from racial radicals, who suggested he should dump out as host thanks to the ridiculous #OscarsSoWhite campaign – a campaign dedicated to the proposition that not enough black people win or are nominated for Oscars. That supposition is factually false; in fact, it’s Latinos who are dramatically underrepresented at the Oscars. But the #OscarsSoWhite campaign offered Hollywood the chance for a “teachable moment” – an opportunity to lecture Americans about their racism, even though it was they being accused of that racism. Rock did that to perfection. “At some point you get to take a picture with the president. As they’re setting up the picture you get a little moment with the president. I’m like, ‘Mr. President, you see all these writers producers and actors, they don’t hire black people – and they’re the nicest white people on Earth. They’re liberals!” Rock said. At another point, Rock explained, “You’re damn right Hollywood’s racist…Hollywood is sorority racist. ‘We like you Rhonda, but you’re not a Kappa.’” The Oscars featured a talking point about black victimhood every 27 seconds or so.\nLady Gaga and Joe Biden Get “Brave.” This being a highly-publicized televised event, the evening could not pass without an appearance by some member of the Obama administration. This time, it was Joe Biden who drew the short straw. He showed up to lecture Americans about the evils of rape – as though rapists everywhere suddenly perked up and decided not to rape women because the creepy guy who can’t stop touching women inappropriately tells them not to. Then Lady Gaga showed up to channel Meat Loaf and sing about how bad rape is. At no point did anyone stop to question whether it might be inappropriate to discuss the evils of rape in the same room as people who gave a standing ovation to convicted child rapist Roman Polanski when he received an Oscar a few years back, or a room full of people who have allegedly ignored an epidemic of child rape in their own midst, or a room full of people who just guffawed at Whoopi Goldberg, the same woman who justified Polanski’s rape as “not rape-rape.”\nBiden made sure to Tweet later:\nProud to stand by my friend @LadyGaga tonight. Pure courage that inspires, challenges us all. #ItsOnUs. All of us. pic.twitter.com/1eee3v0Xd2 — Vice President Biden (@VP) February 29, 2016\nNothing says courage like saying things with which everybody agrees in the face of no adversity at all. Now, if Biden had said something about Hillary Clinton enabling her husband’s rape…\nStacey Dash Makes A Cameo Appearance. Rock introduced Dash to the stage by stating, “It’s hard to get a job, and that’s the truth out there for black actors. But let me tell you some good news: The Academy has taken steps to fix this problem, and that is why it is my honor to introduce the director of our minority outreach program. Please welcome Stacey Dash!” Dash then giggled, “I cannot wait to help my people out. Happy Black History Month!” The joke, of course, is that Dash is not a true black person, since she has said that she thinks Black History Month is racist and ridiculous. Dash is a good sport for participating. But this sort of mockery of the right isn’t helpful.\n“Gender Confirmation Surgery.” At least twice, the Academy used the term “gender confirmation surgery” to describe gender reassignment surgery. This is a politically correct term that suggests that the surgery correctly reinforces the actual gender of a person suffering from gender dysphoria. This is nonsense. Transgender surgery does nothing to decreases rates of suicide for transgenders. As it turns out, gender confirmation requires no surgery. It requires you to know your genetics. End of story.\nDiCaprio Goes Green. Leonardo DiCaprio’s big win for Best Actor seemed to have all of Hollywood entranced; nothing corrects the unfairness of the world quite like an uber-rich Hollywood celebrity who dates hot blonde models also winning a meaningless gold statuette from his idiot colleagues. But DiCaprio couldn’t just get up there and gracefully accept the award: he had to lecture Americans about their carbon usage:\nClimate change is real, and it’s happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world…and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.\nAs to his commentary about big corporations, he said that inside the Dolby Theater. The show was broadcast by ABC. It’s hard to take his talk about the politics of greed seriously when he presumably hightailed it for his private jet afterward. Or perhaps his private yacht.\n“Spotlight” Producer Lectures The Catholic Church. Upon accepting their Oscar, the producers of Spotlight ripped into the Catholic Church: “The film gave a voice to survivors and the Oscar amplifies that voice which we hope will become a choir that will resonate all the way to the Vatican. Pope Francis, it’s time to protect the children and restore the faith.” The truth is that Pope Benedict XVI did a great deal to fight sexual abuse within the church; he met with abuse victims all over the world. Pope Francis has appointed a commission on sexual abuse and the creation of a Vatican tribunal for judging bishops. No word on when the MPAA will do the same for Hollywood.\nThe Gun Control Bracelets. Multiple stars and starlets wore bracelets in favor of gun control to the Oscars; according to People, the bracelets were “decorated in a simple black and gold design” for “influencers” to push the gun control agenda. Obviously, security at the Oscars was quite high. It’s easy to talk gun control when you have people carrying guns surrounding you.\nWhen people wonder at the anger driving so many Republican voters these days, events like the Oscars provide the answer. The self-lauding virtue signaling is sickening. No wonder nobody watched it.\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News, Editor-in-Chief of DailyWire.com, and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
