The order said the case can’t proceed because Officer Kenneth Bradshaw wrote the warrant application and, thus, should’ve signed it instead of having Officer Mary Parks, another school officer, sign it.\nWright resigned his posts as a basketball coach and math and science teacher at the Stone Mountain school after accusations surfaced against him in 2015.\nWright, whose attorney John Burdges noted the warrant error in court filings, had been accused of molestation by sending a lewd image to a child under 16.\nIn another case, Wright is accused of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allegedly letting students have sex in a storage closet in his class.\nWright has pleaded not guilty to those misdemeanor counts and the case is still pending.\nDeKalb schools spokesman Andre Riley said the officers involved in the now dropped case are still with the department.\n“The occurrence has been addressed internally by the department,” he said, declining to comment further on the case.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram\nIn other news:","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local/police-error-saves-dekalb-teacher-from-child-molestation-charge/WgicTBnLbEl6R70WTkrbgI/"}
