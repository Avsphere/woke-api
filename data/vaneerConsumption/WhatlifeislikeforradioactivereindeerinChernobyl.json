For generations, the Sami people, native to the Arctic North, lived in harmony with nature. Many worked as boazovázzi, or \"reindeer walkers,\" herding the animals over hundreds of miles of terrain and selling their meat come slaughter season. The reindeer were a cultural and economic centerpiece for the Sami people.\nBut the explosion — considered the worst civilian nuclear disaster in history — coated the earth with toxic material, turned the reindeer radioactive, and poisoned the Sami people's way of life.\nPhotographer Amos Chapple with Radio Free Europe traveled to the Norwegian village of Snasa, where he met with herders fighting to preserve their traditions.\nChapple shared a few photos with us, and you can read the whole story here.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/chernobyl-radioactive-reindeer-2016-12"}
