People were scattered everywhere.\n\"I can say over 10 people died in the explosion. I can't give precise number of the injured but there are many.\"\n- Bomber 'aged 12' -\nGombi, which lies about 120 kilometres (75 miles) from the state capital, Yola, has been hit several times by Boko Haram attacks, with the most recent taking place in March 2015.\nAdamu Ahmad, a security guard at the market, gave a similar account to Jalo, saying the bomber was believed to be a boy aged around 12.\n\"There was a suicide explosion at the grain section of the market around midday. The explosion killed at least 11 people and injured several others,\" he said.\n\"The attack was believed to have been carried out by a boy of around 12. Today is market day in Gombi and the market attracts thousands of people from the district.\"\nFollowing the blast, the market closed down and all the traders returned home, he added.\nBoko Haram, which is looking to establish a hardline Islamic state in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria, has killed at least 17,000 people since its campaign began in 2009.\nAt the same time, more than 2.6 million others have fled their homes. Some 2.0 million have been displaced within Nigeria, with the others fled into neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger.\nA counter-insurgency begun last year by the Nigerian military, supported by troops from surrounding nations, has succeeded in recapturing swathes of territory lost to the militants in 2014.\nBut cross-border attacks have become more commonplace: on Thursday, four people were killed by suicide bombers in the town of Kerawa in Cameroon's extreme north region.\nOn Monday, at least 37 died in four suicide attacks at a market in Bodo. In all, nearly 1,200 people have been killed in Cameroon since 2003, according to the government in Yaounde.\n\"Soft\" civilian targets such as markets, mosques and bus stations have frequently been hit.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3423002/NE-Nigeria-suicide-bombing-kills-10.html"}
