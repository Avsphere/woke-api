It was supposedly an antismoking poster spotted at a bus stop in Moscow. The poster warned that smoking kills more people than Obama. Turns out the ad was a fake, but that didn't stop it from going viral on social media. NPR's Corey Flintoff reports.\nCOREY FLINTOFF, BYLINE: The fake ad featured a sinister-looking image of President Obama with the photo manipulated so it looked like he was taking a drag on a cigarette. It appeared here, on a glass-enclosed ad board at one end of a bus shelter in north-central Moscow. A white headline said, smoking kills people than Obama, although he kills a lot of people. Don't smoke. Don't be like Obama. The ad got immediate attention when Dmitry Gudkov, a member of Parliament, posted a photo of it on his Facebook page. Gudkov, a frequent critic of the Russian government, said he was disgusted and ashamed of what appeared on the streets of the Russian capital. Suddenly, it was all over the Russian media and appearing in foreign news reports as well. The poster didn't say who created it and no group has taken responsibility, but many of those reports treated it as part of a real anti-smoking campaign. The people in charge of advertising on the Moscow bus system say there was apparently only one poster and that pranksters pried open the advertising box and put the Obama image inside. At the bus stop itself, we couldn't find anyone who'd even seen the poster during the short time before it was removed. Ilnur Sundukov, a 28-year-old who's looking for a job in personnel management, says it was a stupid idea.\nILNUR SUNDUKOV: (Speaking Russian).\nFLINTOFF: \"It's not about smoking,\" he says, \"but about politics.\" And as for Obama being a killer...\nSUNDUKOV: (Speaking Russian).\nFLINTOFF: \"No,\" he says. \"On the news, they tell lies. Take Ukraine, Russia, America, it's all invented to make a conflict and start a war.\" Most people we talked with thought the poster was a political stunt but one that got a whole lot of people talking.
