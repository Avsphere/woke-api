You can try to dam it up and deny it. It won’t work any more than a first grader’s magnet will reverse the magnetic fields of Planet Earth. It won’t work for cunning hillbillies from Hope or big baller builders from Queens or priests from Harrisburg. Try whatever you like.

Might you want to shut up about impeachment until you find a Presidential crime?\nAnd thank you, Wlady. But can someone show me where Stormy and Karen listed their 130 to 159 G extortion payments on their IRS forms?\nMight there be a CRIME there?\nLove you, Ladies.","url":"https://spectator.org/the-lessons-of-all-eternity-and-especially-the-last-few-days/"}
