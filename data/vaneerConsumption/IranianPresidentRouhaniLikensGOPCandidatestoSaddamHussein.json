It was very strange, the things that they spoke of. Some of them wouldn’t even know where Tehran was in relation to Iran, not with distinguishing that one is the capital of the other. So what they spoke of was quite far away from the truth. So, the people of Iran were looking at it as a form of entertainment, if you will, and found it laughable.”\nHe continued, “The other issue is that, yes, certainly in the United States some are opposed it and some are for this agreement. However, the issue of the joint comprehensive plan of action is not just an issue of Iran and the United States. It’s an international issue. It’s an international agreement. Can a government become a signatory to an international agreement and then the subsequent government tear it to sleds? This is something that only the likes of Saddam Hussein would do. So any government that replaces the current government must keep itself committed to the commitments given by the previous administration otherwise that government , that entire country will lose trust internationally.”\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/09/27/iranian-president-rouhani-likens-gop-candidates-to-saddam-hussein/"}
