The kind of uncompromisingly girly shade you probably haven’t experimented with since you were six.\nFashion designers have fallen in love with pink over the past year, with Prada, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana and Alexander McQueen sending it down the catwalks. It was inevitable, then, that it would filter through on to the High Street.\nBut can an adult wear the shade without looking ridiculous? A young girl in pink is often described as cute, but a grown woman? She’s more likely to hear the words ‘Barbie’ or ‘blancmange’.\nHowever, there is good news: you CAN work pink into your wardrobe - provided you stick to a few rules. First, don’t do one single shade top-to-toe. Next, avoid anything unstructured or you’ll be in blancmange territory. Finally, keep it fuss-free - this isn’t the time for sequins.\nAfter that, you’re in the pink.\nTHE WIDE LEG TROUSERS\nPink crepe jersey trousers, £125, winserlondon.com Dagmar jumper, £115, Fenwick, 020 7629 9161 Shoulder bag, £175, russellandbromley.co.uk Black heels, £140, reiss.com\nTHE SIXTIES STAPLE\nTHE DAY DRESS\nTHE CASUAL COAT\nTHE WRAP SKIRT\nHigh waist pencil skirt, £45, closetlondon.com Pink crew neck jumper, £14.90, was £24.90, uniqlo.com Knot leather sandals, £69, topshop.com\nTHE CHIC COAT\nPink Celeste coat, £279, and black court shoes, £129, hobbs.co.uk Grey jumper dress, £46, warehouse.co.uk","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3393041/Grown-ups-wear-pink-FEMAIL-finds-wear-trend-colour-without-looking-like-Barbie-blancmange.html"}
