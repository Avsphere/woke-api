When I first got into it, I would only climb small houses, but as time went on the height of the buildings increased.\n'I studied building plans and the security systems of skyscrapers. We try to test ourselves to get that adrenaline rush which is lacking in everyday life.'\nAccording to the New York photographer, who joins his fellow explorers on their climbs: 'It is dangerous, but the risk for the shot looking over the edge is always worth it to me.'\nA mysterious photographer known as @svvvk on Instagram posed perilously on roof edges in New York with no safety equipment, seen here over Times Square, despite being just a footstep from certain death\nA masked man hangs precariously from a soaring crane with an admittedly nice view of New York's sprawling Central Park\nPictured (left) is the spire on 70 Pine in New York's Financial District and (right) the spire of 40 Wall Street, 925 feet up\nThe snapper adds: 'If there's something out of reach or getting to dangerous, we have a friend lend a hand or call it off and move on.
