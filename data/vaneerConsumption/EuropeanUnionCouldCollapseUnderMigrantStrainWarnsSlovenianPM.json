That is the warning from Slovenian Prime Minister, Miro Cerar, who can only foresee one outcome if the crisis cannot be solved. “If we don’t deliver concrete action, I believe Europe will start falling apart,” he said.\nMr Cerar sent out his dramatic call to fellow central and eastern leaders gathered in Brussels for emergency talks on Monday. He was speaking nine days after Hungary’s move to seal its southern border drove unprecedented migrant tides into tiny Slovenia, all on their way to Germany to take advantage of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s offer of unconditional sanctuary to any and all migrants who arrive on the country’s doorstep.\n“If we don’t find a solution today, if we don’t do everything we can today, then it is the end of the European Union as such,” Cerar said.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pushed for the meeting to be called, said: “Europe must show it is a continent of values, a continent of solidarity … This is a building block but we need to take many further steps.”\nMigrants on the so-called Balkans route switched to Slovenia a week ago when Hungary closed its border with Croatia. Since October 17, more than 62,000 refugees have arrived in Slovenia, with some 14,000 still passing through the country on Sunday alone.\nSmaller countries along the Balkan route say their resources are stretched by the number of people arriving.\nJean-Claude Juncker, the EU’s chief executive, called the leaders of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia to Brussels to seek a common approach.\nThey meet as more than 680,000 migrants have crossed to Europe by sea so far this year from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, according to the International Organisation for Migration.\nThe new arrivals follow years of economic crisis, with Europe’s governments struggling to cope with an influx of people from a host of Middle East countries and, increasingly, sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, presented a proposed 16-point plan containing emergency measures late Sunday night, as well as increasing border surveillance, properly registering refugees and stopping bus and train transfers to the next border without the consent of the neighbouring country.\nHowever, Croatia’s Prime Minister, Zoran Milanovic, called Mr Juncker’s plan “frivolous and unrealistic”. He also demanded that Greece should control its maritime border with Turkey. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, said having a summit on the refugee crisis would be of little use if Turkey were not invited.\nAn announcement on specific details of a future plan of action is expected late on Monday.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2015/10/26/european-union-collapse-migrant-strain-warns-slovenian-pm/"}
