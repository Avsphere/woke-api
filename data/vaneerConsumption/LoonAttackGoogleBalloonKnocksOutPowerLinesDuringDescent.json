The floating access points are meant to stay aloft for about three months, travelling at a safe altitude and eventually coming down in more or less predictable fashion.\nBut a sudden breeze can still knock one off course during descent — which may be what happened to bring this one down near the town of Yakima County town of Harrah.\nGoogle's balloons are operated with FAA approval, and the company said in a statement that \"we coordinate with local air traffic control authorities and have a team dedicated to recovering the balloons when they land.\" In this case, that also meant working with the local utility company, Pacific Power, to fix things up.\nOf course, anything from a falling branch to a stray kite can take out a power line, and the problem is usually resolved in short order.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/loon-attack-google-balloon-knocks-out-power-lines-during-descent-n121676"}
