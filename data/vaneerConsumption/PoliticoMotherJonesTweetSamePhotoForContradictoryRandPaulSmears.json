Rand Paul (R-KY), as they both tweeted out the exact same image for two contradictory narratives about the Paul campaign.\nPolitico’s piece, largely based on anonymous sourcing, says that Rand Paul is disengaged and does not seem to want to win the race.\nMother Jones says that Rand Paul is unprincipled (unlike his father Ron Paul, who MoJo also hates) and will do anything to win.\nNeither piece is particularly worth reading but they do show that 1) liberal writers really despise Sen. Rand Paul in particular and 2) Republicans in general and 3) the organization’s have small photo budgets.\nRand Paul’s photo was unavailable for comment.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/29/politico-mother-jones-tweet-same-photo-for-contradictory-rand-paul-smears/"}
