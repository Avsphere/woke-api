Ted Cruz.\nDailyMail.com asked Trump if he was serious about resisting Cruz until a court decides on his presidential electability.\n'Well, I think you've got a real problem. I think Cruz has a real problem... I would do that. I would absolutely do that. But they've got to rule. He's got to go for a declaratory judgment,' Trump said aboard his private jet on the tarmac in Des Moines, Iowa.\nScroll down for videos\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump boycotted the GOP presidential debate on Thursday night, and says he won't debate rival Ted Cruz until Cruz's eligibility for the presidency is assured\nTrump's boycott on Thursday night left seven other GOP presidential candidates onstage\nTrump went on to joke that he would debate Cruz in Canada – 'to give him home-field advantage,' before pledging to attend next Saturday's Republican debate in Manchester, N.H.\nBut already Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, had dismissed Cruz's proposal as nothing more than a 'publicity stunt.'\n'What we’ve said to Ted Cruz: Go into court, seek a declaratory judgment to find out if you’re even legally eligible to run for president of the United States,' he said Thursday in a Boston radio interview.\n'That's the first thing. Once you’ve gotten that ruling from the federal judge and you’re the last man standing in this presidential contest next to Donald Trump, we’ll be happy to have a debate with you one-on-one, anywhere you want, because that’s the way the system works,' Lewandowski said.\n'But, as it stands right now, we don’t even know if Ted Cruz is legally eligible to run for president of the United States.'\nBuzzfeed first noted the interview with radio host Jeff Kuhner, himself a Canadian.\nCruz was born in Canada in 1970 to an American woman, Eleanor, who was born in Wilmington, Delaware. But the senator held dual citizenship between the two countries for decades before renouncing his Canadian citizenship upon his election to the Senate in 2012.\nSuch a 'natural born' U.S. citizenship is provided for in the Constitution, but legal challenges to it are rare, especially on the presidential campaign trail.\nCruz has been sued by a Houston attorney who claims such a 'natural born citizen' Constitutional requirement has never been defined or determined by the U.S. Supreme Court, or tested in a federal court.\nTrump has been mocking Cruz's claim that he has 'natural-born' U.S. citizenship and has challenged him to prove it in court – contributing to the erasing of a once-significant Cruz lead in Iowa.\nVoters in Iowa will caucus on Feb. 1, representing the crucial first contest in the primary season.\nA group of super PACs backing Cruz has offered to donate $1.5 million to veterans' groups if Trump participates - a proposal that Lewandowski compared to 'a publicity stunt.'\nTrump and Cruz have argued in recent days about the New York developer's use of eminent domain in his projects, which Lewandowski has defended.\nHe has done so by firing back at Cruz's undeclared bank loans, which made news last week when the candidate acknowledged he had failed to file the loans on federal papers.\n'If Ted Cruz were able to disclose the loans that he’s taken out from Goldman Sachs and Citi, then maybe he would use his own money for this, but instead he’s using super PAC money which I don’t even know if he can do legally,' Lewandowski said on ABC News.\n'The bottom line is, you know what we’ve said to Ted Cruz, go into court, seek a declaratory judgment to find out if you’re even legally eligible to run for President of the United States.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3422990/Trump-campaign-manager-Ted-Cruz-ll-debate-one-one-soon-judge-says-eligible-president.html"}
