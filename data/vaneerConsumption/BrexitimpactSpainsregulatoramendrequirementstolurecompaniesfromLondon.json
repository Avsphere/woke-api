If the passport is taken away, then London could cease to be the most important financial centre in Europe, costing the UK thousands of jobs and billions in revenues. Around 5,500 firms registered in the UK rely on the European Union's passporting rights for the financial services sector, and they turn over about £9 billion in revenue.\nSo this is why, if there is a \"hard Brexit\" — leaving the EU without access to the Single Market in exchange for complete control over immigration — or a strong indication that one may happen, firms are likely to relocate.\nBanks are apparently already relocating from London to other cities in Europe\nOn Tuesday, a partner at a massive asset manager warned that the longer it takes for Britain to trigger Article 50, and thereby start the formal two-year Brexit negotiation talks, the more likely it is that companies will \"postpone business investment decisions ... or, worse, speed up decisions to relocate some operations outside.\"\nCurrent EU law allows European banks to operate branches in the UK that do not need to be separately capitalised from the parent company abroad. Similarly, non-EU banks, such as those from the US or Asia, can use their London subsidiary to sell services to clients across the EU. This has allowed London's financial centre to act as a hub for global firms looking to do business in the EU.\nHowever, if London loses financial passporting, it will mean many places will look to relocate its operations.\nMadrid is competing with Frankfurt in Germany and Paris in France for financial company relocations.\nEarlier this month, France's chief financial regulator said some international banks are already in the process of opening up new subsidiaries in Paris in the wake of Brexit.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/brexit-impact-madrids-stock-market-and-regulator-amend-requirements-to-lure-companies-from-london-article-50-2016-12"}
