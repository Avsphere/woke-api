Cities’ property tax rates are still being determined.\nInterim DeKalb CEO Lee May plans to propose tax rates and a midyear budget by June 21, and then the DeKalb Commission may vote on the government’s $1.3 billion spending plan July 12.\nDeKalb property tax rates declined slightly last year, saving roughly $50 a year on a $300,000 house located in an unincorporated area.\nBut tax bills are still increasing for some residents because the assessed values of their properties are going up. Those values, along with tax rates set by local governments, are used to set property tax bills.\nResidential real estate assessments rose an estimated 7.9 percent in DeKalb this year, according to the preliminary tax digest figures.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/dekalb-property-tax-rate-unchanged-for-2016/aWyT0k8goNsetDyQit5gxO/"}
