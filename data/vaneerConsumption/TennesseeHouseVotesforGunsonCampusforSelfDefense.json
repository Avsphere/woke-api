However, it does prohibit “bringing the weapons to stadiums or gymnasiums, hospitals, school-sponsored events or meetings where disciplinary or tenure issues are being discussed.”\nCarving out these zones as carry-free has proven characteristic of most campus carry legislation throughout the country.\nAccording to the Associated Press, Representative Andy Holt (R-Dresden) sponsored the legislation in the House. Senator Mike Bell (R-Riceville) sponsored the legislation in the Senate.\nGovernor Bill Haslam (R) is vacillating between supporting and opposing the legislation. He expressed concern that the bill takes away a public college or university’s option in the matter.\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
