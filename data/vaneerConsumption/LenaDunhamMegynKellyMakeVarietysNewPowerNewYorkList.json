She might share them with you one day. Or maybe she’ll keep them to herself. Either way, she still has a hell of a lot left to say,” Konner added.\nKelly — who was honored at Variety‘s “Power of Women” luncheon in New York earlier this year — received a tribute written by Judge Judy Scheinlin, of Judge Judy fame.\n“Megyn Kelly is one of those rare women who seamlessly combines professional excellence and family,” Scheinlin wrote of the Fox News host. “I think Megyn has the talent to do anything she wants to do. She is a star and she’s still growing. I’m as old as Methuselah. She’s a kid. Her opportunities are only limited by her dreams.”\nMeanwhile, Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker editor David Remnick lauded Buzzfeed’s Ben Smith, whom he called “politically astute and personally intelligent;” Dunham celebrated actress Leslie Jones, calling her stage presence on Saturday Night Live “witty, wise and utterly original;” and Bill Clinton praised his daughter Chelsea for taking a “leading role in modernizing our operations” at the Clinton Foundation.\nView Variety‘s complete “New Power New York” list here.\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2016/09/27/lena-dunham-leslie-jones-megyn-kelly-make-variety-new-power-new-york-list/"}
