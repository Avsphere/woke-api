They made unsolicited statements implicating themselves in multiple crimes. And, at the Metro Regional Youth Detention Center where they were taken, police said they threatened officers with physical violence and flashed gang signs to other juveniles.\nThe suspects, whose names were not released, were arrested after a woman was rear-ended by a stolen vehicle near Midtown on Sunday — and then carjacked by one of its passengers.\nThe victim was driving on Avery Drive NE and preparing to turn onto Beverly Road when she was rear-ended by a silver Jeep Liberty with multiple young men inside, police previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The victim got out of her car and attempted to speak with the driver of the Liberty, but he did not roll down his window.\nThe driver-side passenger got out and “jumped into” the victim’s Ford Escape, police said. Both vehicles drove off.\nPolice got a break in the case when an employee at a gas station in the 1900 block of Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway called them Sunday night. The employee said two juveniles entered the store, one with a handgun, according to the police report.\nThe carjacking victim’s Ford Escape was nearby. Police arrested all six juveniles a short time later on obstruction and other charges.\nThe arrests come as Midtown residents have grown more alarmed about recent carjackings, robberies and break-ins in their neighborhood.\nAtlanta Mayor Kasim Reed on Tuesday hosted a town hall meeting in Midtown where residents expressed their concerns.\nReed unveiled a plan to increase the number of officers on the street and to have a special detail conduct sweeps around Piedmont Park.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/cops-suspects-atlanta-carjacking-were-joking-flashing-gang-signs/VSW2avaxpYSHlV3bRfR9ZO/"}
