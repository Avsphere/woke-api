I gently circled the supermarket aisles, my ears trained for the imminent announcement.\nAround me, I could see other shoppers doing the same thing. They were coiled, tightly sprung, ready to pounce. The atmosphere was like the starting line of a 100m sprint as we waited for the gun.\nAnd there it was! ‘We’d like to announce a selection of discounted foods is now available in aisle 22. Thank you for shopping at Tesco and have a nice evening.’\nJulia Lawrence admitted to yanking a sirloin steak out of someone's grasp when the bargains were announced\nI was off. I tried not to catch the eye of the woman beside me, trying to pass on the inside. I cut her off expertly, and took the corner at speed into aisle 22, where already a sizeable crowd was gathering.\nA supermarket worker was struggling to unload battered boxes and enticing white bags, all bearing the hallowed yellow sticker from a tall, cage-like trolley. This was the food about to hit its sell-by date, that’s sold at the end of the day for a fraction of its original price.\nElbows were getting sharp, the crowd was becoming more dense, so I resorted to a tried tactic of ‘going low’ — crouching down, rummaging between other shoppers’ legs and dragging out white bags at random.\nIt’s borne terrific fruit in the past — a slab of my favourite New York deli pie for £1, and fresh tiger prawns for 50p.\nAnd this time, joy of joys, there was a sirloin steak joint — a mighty great brick of a thing just begging to be slow pot-roasted in red wine — going for just £5.\nSomeone else had seen it, too, and I felt a resistance as I tried to tug the bag through the wall of legs. So I snatched it, yanking it out of someone’s grasp. I had to stop myself punching the air and whooping ‘Yesssss!’.\nOnly when I looked up and saw the revulsion in my teenage daughter’s eyes did the full shame of what I was doing hit me. ‘God, you are so EMBARRASSING!’ she gasped. ‘I am going to wait in the car.’\nWhat is it about discount time at the supermarket that turns so many of us into greedy, selfish, rude bullies? For all I knew, the person fighting me for that steak could have been a struggling pensioner.\nFor I am not poor — not by a long way. I’ve worked, and saved, hard. The coat I was wearing as I scrabbled on the shop floor cost more than some people pay in monthly rent in London, and I live in a house — now, mortgage free — worth close to £1 million.\nThe car outside, in which my daughter was cowering in shame, is brand new. But there is just something about that magic hour that brings out the worst in me.\nKathryn Ebdon, 47, a business consultant, who lives in Paddock Wood, Kent, with husband Dave, 47, an accountant, admits they’re not short of cash, but still sniff out bargains each week\nAnd plenty of others too, it seems. Video footage released last week showed supermarket shoppers elbowing rivals out of the way in a desperate effort to get their hands on cut-price food, at Tesco in New Malden, South-West London.\nCustomers were seen throwing pineapples, beans and eggs into their baskets and overturning the green vegetable containers. One man then looked at the camera and gave a thumbs-up sign as he balanced his pile of food.\nA Tesco employee even injured his ankle after getting caught up in the scrum. The clip gave a shocking insight into the lengths to which some people will go to pick up bargains.\nNone of the people in the clip, I should stress, looked undernourished or badly dressed. But then, many see no shame in it. Well-paid professionals say harnessing bargain hour means they can fund an enviable lifestyle.\nPeople such as Kathryn Ebdon, 47, a business consultant, who lives in Paddock Wood, Kent, with husband Dave, 47, an accountant. They too admit they’re not short of cash, but still sniff out bargains each week. ‘The savings all add up and mean we don’t have to worry about getting into debt,’ says Kathryn. ‘We’re in the process of putting a £100,000 extension on our period cottage and didn’t have to borrow a penny.\n‘Buying food with yellow stickers means we can eat well and feed our dog and two cats for just £50 a week, without having to give up on life’s little luxuries.’\nRoss Macdougall, 32, an audio visual technician from Edinburgh, and his wife Laura-Anne, 30, who works in retail, say yellow sticker shopping has enabled them to get their foot on the property ladder, and start a family (they have a son, Lewis, who’s three) ahead of some of their peers.\nRoss Macdougall, 32, an audio visual technician from Edinburgh, and his wife Laura-Anne, 30, who works in retail, say yellow sticker shopping has enabled them to get their foot on the property ladder, and start a family (they have a son, Lewis, pictured who’s three)\nThey even turn it into a family outing. ‘Last Saturday night at 9pm, my wife and I headed to our local Tesco in search of yellow sticker discounts. And we weren’t disappointed — picking up £37 worth of groceries for just £3.70.’\nThankfully, on this particular night, things didn’t turn nasty. ‘I’ve witnessed some terrible pushing and shoving in the past. It’s unbelievable,’ says Ross.\nDr Dimitri Tsivrikos, consumer psychologist at University College London, explains we simply cannot help ourselves: ‘What is happening here is evolutionary psychology. We are all competing for resources, regardless of how rich we are, or how much we need the food in question. We are, basically, hunters, and in a competitive environment all dignity and manners are lost.\n‘I saw it myself last week in Waitrose, in a very nice area of North London, well-dressed ladies elbowing each other out of the way to get to a yoghurt promotion. It was very funny.\n‘What you have to remember here is that the prize is secondary, this is all about the winning. Supermarkets capitalise on this instinct. You may notice at discount time the music may be louder, to confuse and excite us. Also, the aisles may be busier, all of which will tell us that there isn’t much time and that we need to hurry, making us impatient and aggressive.’\nKelly Eroglu, 41, an air stewardess who lives near Newport, Wales, with partner, Stewart, 41, and children Emma, 14, and Arin, 11, agrees. Although an bargain hunter herself — she spends no more than £35 on a week’s groceries — she is often taken aback by behaviour in the aisles.\nKelly Eroglu, 41, an air stewardess who lives near Newport, Wales, with partner, Stewart, 41, (pictured with their children Emma, 14, and Arin, 11) says although she is a bargain hunter she is taken aback by behaviour in the aisles\n‘I saw one family of five surround the store assistant with the reduction sticker gun, so no one else could get near, then put everything she marked down into their baskets,’ she says.\n‘Another time a woman used her trolley as a blockade to keep everyone else away from the reduced section, while she emptied the shelves. But the minute she took her hands off the trolley a chap grabbed it and wheeled it to the next aisle where other shoppers grabbed all her cut-price food for themselves.’\nKelly, who shops for discounted food two or three times a week, says the best time to find high-end bargains is in the last wave of reductions, which usually start at around 5pm. ‘I go to Waitrose or M&S. I put everything in the freezer. Last year, I saved £80 on birthday cakes alone.’\nKelly pictured with her bargain buys\nHowever, it’s not just hard-pressed parents who have the sharpest elbows. Kevin Buxton, 46, an actor from Barkway, Hertfordshire and a single dad to Alex, 15, says some of the worst behaviour is from pensioners.\n‘They seem to think they have a divine right to this food, standing in front of the shelves, blocking anyone else from getting near. Then the pushing and shoving starts. They will throw it all into their trolley and walk away.\n‘They then take a closer look as they walk around the store and decide what to keep. Sadly, what they don’t want is left scattered around the store, where it spoils, which is incredibly wasteful.’\nDue to the erratic nature of his work, Kevin says 90 per cent of his groceries are discounted. ‘I can be paid £35,000 for one commercial but I might not earn anything else for the rest of the year, so I have to eke my money out. I do get disparaging glances when people see that everything in my basket has a yellow sticker, but it’s just snobbery.\n‘The ladies on the tills, however, are very used to me. If they saw me buying food at full price they’d think I’d won the Lottery.’\nHeather Phillips, 78, who lives in Dartford, Kent, with husband Frank, 83, is unabashed by her bargain hunting. She says: ‘We plan our meals according to what’s on discount. If I see the staff coming around with the price clicker, I hover close by to see what I fancy. We don’t like cheap food, we like good food for a good price — and don’t see the point of paying more than we need to.\nThe result of their thriftiness? Annual Mediterranean cruises and membership of a David Lloyd gym, which costs £700 a year. ‘Being thrifty with our groceries means we enjoy some of life’s other luxuries,’ says Heather.\nWell worth a scramble in the supermarket, surely?\nInterviews: Helen Carroll","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4318470/How-middle-class-women-coming-blows-reductions.html"}
