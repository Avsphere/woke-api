They found that the horizontal difference between the two paintings was about 2.7 inches (69 millimeters), which is close to the average distance between a person's two eyes. (When a person observes an object, each eye sees a slightly different perspective of the object, both of which are sent to the brain and transformed into the three-dimensional representation of the object that we \"see.\")","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/did-da-vinci-create-3-d-mona-lisa-n96041"}
