Keith Shaddix said.\n“It was also suspected that the person with the stolen cell phone was attempting to use stolen credit cards at Wal-Mart,” Shaddix said.\nSwain located the suspect, later identified as 37-year-old Clifford Bernard Neal, “and asked for his ID and found that the suspect did not have it on his person,” Shaddix said. “Swain went with the suspect to a black Mercedes SUV for the suspect to retrieve his ID.”\nShaddix said that when they got to the Mercedes, Neal tried to drive away and Swain began struggling with him.\n“The suspect began to drive away with Swain inside the vehicle with him and Swain deployed a Taser to stop the suspect,” he said. “The suspect crashed into a parked car and the suspect was able to pull the Taser wires loose. Officer Swain was thrown from the vehicle as it was backing up.”\nAfter being thrown from the vehicle, Swain fired several shots at the SUV as it fled the parking lot.\nShaddix said Swain was treated at a local hospital for injuries to his leg.\n“It was also discovered that a witness was possibly struck by a round that ricocheted off the vehicle,” he said. “The witness was also treated at the hospital for an injury to his leg.\nThe SUV was recovered Friday in Atlanta, Shaddix said.\nHe said warrants have been issued for Neal on charges that include aggravated assault, battery against a police officer, felony obstruction, giving a false name, hit-and-run and reckless driving.\nNeal has been convicted of 22 crimes dating back to 1996, ranging from credit card fraud and forgery to entering vehicles and cocaine possession, according to Georgia Department of Corrections records. He has done five different stints in the state prison system, and was last released from prison in February, 2012.","url":"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/police-seek-driver-who-hurt-villa-rica-cop-wal-mart-parking-lot/qdUOq9sUUxXIkSazZmoZLL/"}
