Before mentioning the tragic events at Ft. Hood, Obama apparently felt it was imperative to give a cheerful “shout-out\" to the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Dr. Joe Medicine Crow. In 2009 the president delayed statements that condemn domestic terrorism to acknowledge a Native American; now, in 2014, Barack Obama has directed his comments to those who oppose his executive amnesty, citing ineligibility to protest the invasion if a protestor’s ancestry is not directly rooted in America.

 there have been periods where the folks who were already here have said, 'Well I don't want those folks.’\nWith those words, the president sent a message to his critics that there was once a time when white people weren’t welcome in America either. That cheap shot was an attempt to rally support for amnesty by reminding those gathered in Chicago that when they arrived here Europeans also met with anti-immigrant sentiment.\nThe kicker is that he then added this caveat: “the only people who have the right to [object to immigration] are some Native Americans.”\nBy making such an absurd statement, Barack Obama expressed the opinion that the only ones who have a legitimate right to oppose an invasion by “those folks” are Native Americans, because they were in America first.\nThe president’s skewed logic is that those whose ancestors he believes conquered Native Americans have no right to object to being conquered.\nIn addition, Obama, who favors one race, identifies with the liberal tribe, and seems to loathe bitter Bible clingers, chided the audience by pointing out: “Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently[.]”\nYeah! And the one “treating other folks differently” would be you.\nDifferent or not, what is plain is that in Obama’s opinion, the descendants of those who he thinks subjugated Native Americans should accept a modern-day Christopher Columbus named Barack Obama who, like the Columbus of old, is also “governing as he pleases.”\nAfter all, according to Obama, Christian European colonizers oppressed the indigenous people, so six centuries later those with Christian European lineage had better not grumble.\nFor all intents and purposes, Obama conquering and transforming America may very well be the president's version of Native American reparations. Executive amnesty could be Barack’s way of teaching the descendants of White Europeans what being occupied feels like.\nOne sure way to share the pain is by importing the Third-World diseases that are currently infecting and killing healthy Americans with things like Enterovirus D-68, MDR-TB, and Chagas. In a way, Barack is doing what many on the left accuse White European settlers of doing, which is to expose an uncontaminated population to diseases to which they have no immunity.\nThe problem with the logic of the traveler of 57 states (not counting Alaska and his highly dubious birth state of Hawaii) is that his type of vindictive compensation is rooted in historical fiction.\nIf a present-day American’s heritage includes a relative migrating to the U.S. from anywhere else in the world and said individual is disqualified from expressing an opinion on illegal immigration, then Native Americans should be disqualified too.\nIn addition to archeological evidence that claims humans were in North America thousands of years before Native Americans arrived, over the years genetic clues have indicated America’s first colonists migrated from Siberia. It is believed that the people Obama refers to as native, much like the illegal aliens who walk across the border into the U.S., actually walked across the ice from Russia to what is now called America.\nMore recently, scientists in Denmark extracted DNA from a juvenile skeleton from a Siberian site in Mal'ta, Russia near Lake Baikal that was found with miniature Venus sculptures similar to small figurines made by European hunter-gatherers.\nScientists now believe it’s quite possible, based on that and a newly discovered sequenced genome, that one-third of Native American genes come from west Eurasian people linked to the Middle East and Europe, not solely from East Asia as previously thought.\nWhat science indicates is that unbeknownst to Barack Obama, the very people he’s using as a weapon to suppress criticism of his attempt to circumvent the Constitution were migrants too.\nWorse yet, it could be that one-third of those Obama said are the only people who have the right to object to illegal immigration actually originated from the same part of the world as those Obama says have no right to complain: Europe.\nSo try as he might to justify his lawlessness by endeavoring to inflict guilt on Americans for having a heritage in countries other than America, the truth is that the supposedly native peoples Obama is politically exploiting are not native at all.\nThe crux of the issue is that the only individuals indigenous to one part of the world are those who originated in the “cradle of civilization.” Everyone else, including American Indians, migrated and then settled far from home.\nIf the president is maintaining that modern-day Americans have no right to complain because their ancestors trekked to the New World from somewhere else, then neither do Native Americans. And as nightmarish as it might be for Obama’s liberal fantasy, both modern-day illegals and Native Americans may actually possess the same DNA as the European New World explorers Barack Obama seeks to vilify.\nJeannie hosts a blog at www.jeannie-ology.com","url":"https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2014/12/are_native_americans_our_european_ancestors.html"}
