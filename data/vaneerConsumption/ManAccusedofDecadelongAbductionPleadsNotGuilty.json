The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nBy NBCLosAngeles.com\nThe man accused of kidnapping a teenage girl, forcing her to marry him and living with her for a decade pleaded not guilty Monday, and neighbors of the alleged victim and suspect turned up in court to support his version of the story.\nThe 42-year-old husband and father allegedly kidnapped and sexually abused the woman who would become his wife and the mother of their child.\nPolice said Isidro Garcia drugged the then 15-year-old and initially took her from her home in Santa Ana to a home in Compton, where he held her captive.\nThen, for more than a decade, prosecutors say, Garcia kept her under his thumb, convincing her that her family no longer wanted her.\nBut it might be a difficult case to prove, given that the alleged victim had her own car and came and went as she pleased from their Bell Gardens apartment in recent years.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-accused-decade-long-abduction-pleads-not-guilty-n126961"}
