You can get your hair cut somewhere else.'\nGeorge Kay, the estranged husband of Kerry Katona, arrives at Hove Crown Court this morning\nKay was arrested following an alleged row at the couple's home in Crowborough on September 19 after an alleged row.\nHe was charged by Sussex Police with assault by beating and possessing a banned weapon, relating to a Taser-style instrument which was disguised.\nAt Hove Crown Court today, Kay, an ex-rugby league player from Warrington, Cheshire, pleaded not guilty to both charges and will stand trial from April 25.\nFormer I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Katona, who married labourer Kay in 2014, is likely to give evidence in the case.\nThe alleged attack is said to have taken place just five days after the couple's one-year wedding anniversary.\nKatona married ex-rugby league player Kay in 2014 but has revealed they split after his arrest\nSince then, three-times married Katona, 35, has announced the couple have split.
