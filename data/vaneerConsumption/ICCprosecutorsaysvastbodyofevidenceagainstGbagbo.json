When he understood that the presidency was going to escape him ... he began a campaign of violence orchestrated against those considered opponents,\" she added.\nDespite being \"in a position to do so,\" Bensouda maintained Gbagbo \"never ordered the violence to stop.\"\nBensouda also reacted to criticism that she was only prosecuting crimes committed by Gbagbo's camp during the violence.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3420851/ICC-prosecutor-says-vast-body-evidence-against-Gbagbo.html"}
