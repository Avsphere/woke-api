They are American studies professors Simon Bronner, Michael Rockland, Michael Barton and Charles Kupfer.\nIn December 2013, the ASA membership approved the boycott with two-thirds of the 1,252 members who voted in support. At the time of the vote, there were 3,853 eligible voters, meaning a third of the membership participated. The boycott is not binding on members and targets institutions, not individuals.\nThe lawsuit charges that a boycott of another country is outside the scope of ASA’s charter.\nRerad more here:","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2016/04/22/professors-sue-american-studies-association-boycotting-israel/"}
