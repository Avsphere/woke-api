El Chapo doesn't appear in the astonishing footage.\nGuzman initially gave Mexican security forces the slip by opening a secret doorway hidden behind a mirror, and descending into a sophisticated tunnel leading to the city's drains.\nJoaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman Loera pictured above in the moments after his capture\nBefore he was caught, Guzman spent hours below ground as his henchmen sought to lure pursuing Marines up toward the roof of the house he had been holed up in.\nAs rains started to fill the drains, Guzman eventually emerged from a manhole near a gas station a mile across town and stole a car at gunpoint.\nThe video broadcast on Monday shows images of the interior of the group floor dressing room where the tunnel entrance was hidden.\nIt took the Marines 90 minutes to find the tunnel entrance, giving Guzman a crucial headstart to flee. The lever to open the reinforced door behind the mirror was concealed in the light of the dressing room.\nMarines found another hole beneath a fridge which proved to be a red herring, the apparent beginnings of a project to build another escape route. They also found two women cowering in one of the home's five bathrooms.\n'My holidays are over,' Guzman said when he was finally caught, Televisa reported.\nItems found by Marines at the Los Mochis property included DVDs of La Reina Del Sur, a fictional series about a female drug boss starring Mexican actress Kate del Castillo.\nImages broadcast by Televisa showed blood and bullet holes spattered on the white walls of the house. In Chapo's downstairs bedroom, there were flatscreen TVs and a sofa littered with injectable testosterone, syringes, antibiotics and condoms.\nThe marines busted through two doors to find 15 of Guzman's henchman armed with machine guns and rocket launchers.\nFive of the hitmen were killed in the shootout, one of them falling from the roof down to a patio and another escaping outside before dying on the street, Televisa said.\nMexico is formally starting extradition proceedings against Guzman, President Enrique Pena Nieto's government said late on Sunday, in the strongest sign yet that it intends to send him to the United States. But the process could take a year or more.\nThe 58-year-old, who is being held at Altiplano Prison in central Mexico, is now expected to be extradited to the United States to face multiple drugs charges.\nTo prevent a similar escape, Guzman is being held in a cell with a floor made with three layers of steel under poured concrete. He is in solitary confinement and only allowed outside for one hour a day.\nGuzman's prison break in July was his second, and authorities hope incarceration in the United States will insure he stays behind bars.\nThe head of extradition for the Mexican Attorney General's Office says it probably will take at least a year to extradite Guzman.\nMeeting El Chapo:Mexican authorities have said they want to speak to Hollywood actor Sean Penn after it emerged he met the fugitive at a secret location in the Mexican jungle to discuss his life as a crime boss\nOfficials had previously estimated a six-month minimum, but Jose Manuel Merino told local media that the extradition would probably take 'one year or longer'.\nMerino told Radio Formula that the length of the process would depend on how hard the defendant's lawyers fight each stage. Merino said the process had lasted as long as six years, in one case.\nThe Attorney General's Office issued a statement Sunday it's started the extradition mechanism by notifying Guzman that two arrest warrants from the U.S. are being processed.\nGuzman's attorney Juan Pablo Badillo has said that the defense already has filed six motions to challenge extradition requests.\nMexican authorities have said they want to speak to Hollywood actor Sean Penn after it emerged he met the fugitive at a secret location in the Mexican jungle to discuss his life as a crime boss.\nThe actor, Madonna's first husband, sat down with the drugs boss for seven hours for a Rolling Stone magazine interview.\nThe meeting last October was reportedly arranged by Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, 43.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3394310/Newly-released-footage-shows-Mexican-marines-shootout-cartel-henchmen-capture-drug-lord-El-Chapo.html"}
