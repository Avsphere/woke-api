I’d watch it — in fact, I’d never want to turn it off.\nOur biggest land mammals are natural stars on the small screen, as we discovered in Paul O’Grady: For The Love Of Animals — India (ITV). O’Grady met monkeys, leopards and even orphaned rhinos, but the rescued elephants at a sanctuary near the Taj Mahal stole the show.\nPaul O'Grady meets one of the elephants at the SOS Wildlife Sanctuary north of Delhi\nWe’re used to seeing O’Grady getting weepy over forlorn pooches at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. When he met elderly Mohan, who had been kept in chains for 50 years and was forced to do tricks for tourists, he broke down.\nPaul was boiling with anger over the spiked leg irons the elephant had worn, like rusty implements from a torture chamber.\nThe years of cruelty meant vets had to coax the scarred giant to lie down each day for his wounds and abscesses to be treated.\nFighting a lump in his throat, O’Grady stroked the elephant’s gaunt head and knarled backbone. But he held his emotions together, until Mohan looked up and a single tear rolled down his trunk. We expect our celebs to sob on demand, but I had no idea that elephants cried. Nor did Paul: he ordered the camera crews to stop filming and rushed away.\nPaul O'Grady meets SOS Wildlife Co-founder Kartick Satyanarayan and two of the elephants at the SOS Sanctuary for a new two-part ITV documentary series\nThe deep feelings that these extraordinary animals share with us were on display again when a group of rescued elephants formed a circle and joined trunks.\nTheir keeper commented they had formed a new herd, but their kinship seemed deeper than that. These animals looked like friends.\nElephants can behave like humans in less virtuous ways. Teenager Lakshmi was a greedyguts who had grown so fat on junk food that she was too obese and arthritic to walk to the waterhole.\nPaul had to bring a hose and wash her down, giving her a sort of pachyderm bed bath.\nPaul will film at locations across India, meeting extraordinary animals old and young who are in desperate need of care\nInstead of feeding her properly, her owners left her to beg outside a temple, where tourists plied her with curry and chips until she was two tons overweight.\nShe’s lost 100st on a diet of cucumbers and bananas, but is still known as ‘the square elephant’, a huge breeze block with ears and a trunk. Lakshmi has more than another half a ton to go before she hits her target weight. Then she can release her own fitness video and become a celebrephant.\nPaul kept breaking off to pick tea or take tuk-tuk taxi rides. But we can see generic subcontinent shows like that any time. Just give us Jumbo TV.\nElsewhere amid the high numbers on the remote, a guilty pleasure returned — telly’s most puerile gameshow, Taskmaster (Dave).\nTV's most puerile game show, Taskmaster, with comedian Greg Davies (left)\nFormer Bake Off presenter Mel Giedroyc and her successor, comedian Noel Fielding, are among the contestants performing ridiculous challenges to win the worst trophy ever devised. It’s supposed to be a bust of host Greg Davies’s head, though it looks more like a coconut dipped in yellow paint.\nThe games are infantile — knocking down rubber ducks, squishing fruit and other inanities. It’s The Generation Game for overgrown toddlers.\nBut it’s such good-hearted (and frequently foul-mouthed) fun that Taskmaster becomes addictive. Can Hugh Dennis obliterate a fruit cake more inventively than Mel or Noel?\nStart watching and you’ll feel a strange compulsion to learn the answer.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4446014/When-tortured-elephant-tears-cry.html"}
