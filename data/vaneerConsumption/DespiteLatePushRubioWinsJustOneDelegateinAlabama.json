Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Marco Rubio (R-FL), by earning 43 percent of the 857,945 ballots cast, with Cruz and Rubio earning 21 percent and 19 percent respectively.\nIn the “winner-take-most” state of Alabama, Trump earned 20 of the 29 at-large delegates determined by the statewide tally and 16 of the delegates that were awarded on the basis of the candidate’s performance in each of the state’s seven individual congressional districts based on math done by thegreenpapers.com.\nBy virtue of exceeding 20 percent statewide and in four of Alabama’s seven congressional districts, Cruz will add 13 delegates from Alabama to his overall tally.\nHowever, despite having an operation in place in Alabama, Rubio failed to hit the 20 percent mark statewide and in all but one of the state’s congressional districts, Alabama’s fifth congressional district, located in the northern part of the state. That will means he will walk away from the Alabama contest earning at least one single delegate.\nRubio was backed by the state’s former Republican Party chairman Bill Armistead and had a list of candidates for delegate made up the who’s who of Alabama Republican Party politics, including Jerry Lathan, the husband of current Alabama Republican Party chairman Terry Lathan.\nRubio also made a late push in Yellowhammer state, making campaign appearances headed into Super Tuesday in both Birmingham and Huntsville.\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/03/01/despite-late-push-rubio-wins-just-one-delegate-in-alabama/"}
