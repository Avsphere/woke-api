They also say he lied on loan applications to obtain millions more to maintain a lavish lifestyle.\nManafort's attorneys didn't call witnesses in his defense, claiming the prosecution had failed to meet its burden of proof. His attorneys attacked the credibility of a key witness, one-time Manafort protege Rick Gates.\nThe trial is the first courtroom test of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller, though the case doesn't involve allegations of Russian election interference.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/aug/20/jury-begins-3rd-day-deliberations-manafort-fraud-t/"}
