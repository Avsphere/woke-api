Therefore no further details will be released about this ticket-holder's claim.\"\nA spokeswoman for the National Lottery said: \"We're delighted that the winner of this amazing prize has now come forward and we hope that they will enjoy their win.\n\"It would have been awful if the ticket-holder had missed out on this substantial and life-changing amount of money.\"\nCamelot announced the development after it was confirmed that it had not sought to recover CCTV footage from a shop where Worcester resident Susanne Hinte claimed to have bought a ticket bearing the winning numbers.\nMs Hinte, from Warndon, hit the headlines after reportedly informing friends that she had inadvertently washed the crumpled ticket in a pair of jeans.\nMeanwhile, the Crown Prosecution Service said Ms Hinte was alleged to have committed two offences of theft in Birmingham in January last year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3420717/Washing-machine-Lotto-ticket-claimant-faces-trial-alleged-stolen-purse.html"}
