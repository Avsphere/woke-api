Here they first attained statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance, and gave to the world the eternal Book of Books.\nAfter being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.\nImpelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland.
