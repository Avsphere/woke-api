He was taken by ambulance to an area hospital for observation.\nWhile hospitalized, Stamos was cited for misdemeanor DUI; however it was later determined the common date rape drug GHB was found in his system.\nSources close to the star later said he had been taking GHB as a fitness supplement to “lean out mass,” as the drug is known to help stimulate growth hormones and help muscles recover.\nThe actor spent a month in rehab following his arrest, temporarily stepping away from production on Fox’s Grandfathered and Netflix’s Full House reboot, Fuller House, in the process, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nStamos will be arraigned in Los Angeles County Superior Court Friday morning.\nIf convicted, the star could spend a maximum of six months in jail.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/10/15/john-stamos-facing-jail-time-after-dui-charge/"}
