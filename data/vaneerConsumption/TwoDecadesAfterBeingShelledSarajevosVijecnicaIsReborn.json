Some Bosnians are unhappy at the amount of space in the \"new\" building allocated to the corruption-plagued city government and its politicians instead of books.\nSarajevo Mayor Ivo Komsic told a news conference on Thursday that the Vijecnica was “being given back to its citizens,” a remark that brought a chorus of jeers and laughter from local reporters.\nThe building’s return to glory is part of a year long program of exhibitions, conferences and concerts in Sarajevo marking the 100th anniversary of the start of World War One. On June 28, the date of Ferdinand’s assassination, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra will perform in Vijecnica.\nA pivotal role in two wars might seem an unlikely basis for celebration, but in acknowledging the city’s history Sarajevo’s leaders are promoting a message of reconciliation. Conferences on international peace and the lessons from the region’s troubled history are taking place next month.\nMore than 10,000 people died during the city's three-and-a-half year siege in which Bosnian Serbs took control of the hills surrounding Sarajevo, bombarding it with shells and killing civilians with snipers as they sought food and water.\nThe Vijecnica was struck on Aug 25, 1992, starting a fire that reduced the building to rubble. Most of the two million books inside it were also destroyed.\nWhile the West dithered over military intervention, Sarajevo’s wearied inhabitants fought for survival - even digging a tunnel from the U.N.-controlled airport in order to bring supplies into the city. As the world looked on, Smajlovic, a performer with the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra, regularly played his cello at the funerals of sniper victims and in the ruins of shell-damaged buildings.\nHe was also among the first on the scene as the building burned. The 57-year-old recalled Thursday how he and other inhabitants tried to rescue books from the flames. “The [attackers] did their jobs, the firefighters did their jobs and we did ours,” he said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/two-decades-after-being-shelled-sarajevos-vijecnica-reborn-n100356"}
