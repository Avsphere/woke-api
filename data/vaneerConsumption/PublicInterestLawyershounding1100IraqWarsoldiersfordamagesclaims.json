The taxpayer will pick up the bill.\nSolicitors hounding British troops over their role in the Iraq War plan to launch more than 1,100 compensation claims and use the Human Rights Act to seek payouts for the families of alleged victims (file picture)\nThe MoD disclosed last night that PIL has indicated it will submit 1,154 suits alleging negligence by British personnel in Iraq.\nA single incident can lead to a serviceman enduring five separate investigations over more than a decade. As pressure grows for the ‘witch-hunt’ to end, it also emerged that:\nAbu Jamal, an Iraqi agent paid £40,000 a year by the MoD, is taking a cut of compensation already handed out to fund his lavish lifestyle;\nFamilies who have received payouts in Basra have bought luxury cars and huge homes in wealthy neighbourhoods;\nThree soldiers cleared of manslaughter in 2006 now face a third investigation into their conduct;\nSoldiers found to have mistreated Iraqis could be fined thousands of pounds;\nThe Iraq Historic Allegations Team has completed just 18 cases in five years – with wrongdoing shown in just one of them.\nThe five investigations an accused soldier can face start with the initial military inquiry. This is followed by a summons from IHAT, with some also likely to be dragged before an inquest-style body called Iraq Fatality Investigations. And, as well as the civil claim, there is the prospect of a prosecution at the Hague for war crimes.\nLast night Colonel Richard Kemp said troops were being subjected to torment.\nIRAQI TRIED TO GRAB MY GUN SO I SHOT, NOW I CAN'T CLEAR MY NAME Decorated: Sergeant Kevin Williams A decorated soldier was left penniless and jobless after being put through a series of inquiries over the death of an Iraqi man 13 years ago. Sergeant Kevin Williams shot Hassan Abbas Said because he believed he was going to shoot him after the Iraqi grabbed his rifle during a violent struggle in 2003. The soldier, then aged 21, was cleared by two military investigations – only to then face a murder charge in a civilian court, where he was once again cleared. He went on to be praised for his heroism after saving seven lives in Afghanistan. But then his case was taken on by the Iraq Historical Allegations Team, followed by a second body, Iraq Fatality Investigations. The Daily Mail revealed his ordeal last March after it emerged he could face a war crimes trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He waived his right to anonymity and said at the time: ‘It is a disgrace that soldiers are having to explain their actions so ambulance-chasing lawyers can abuse farcical rulings and line their pockets on the death of Iraqi civilians.’ Mr Williams, now 32, who joined the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment in 1999 aged 16, added: ‘I was just doing my job as a soldier fighting for my country. You expect the Army to support you. They haven’t. Nobody has.’ He left the Army in 2013 and moved back to Iraq to work in private security in 2014, but lost his job when the IFI inquiry – which later attributed no blame to him for Mr Said’s death – was announced. He found another security job in Iraq but lost the post within hours of the investigation by the ICC being announced.\nHe added: ‘Just one investigation into soldiers who have been through immense trauma in Iraq causes huge concern and leaves the incident hanging over their heads.\n‘To potentially face five just doesn’t even bear thinking about. It is hugely damaging to every individual. Apart from the effect it has on their normal life, some are suffering from stress and there have been cases of attempted suicide, marital breakdown, and soldiers losing their jobs due to a huge barrage of legal action.\n‘This is a case of exploiting lawyers and lying Iraqis wanting to make money.’\nThe £57million IHAT squad has been examining more than 1,500 alleged cases of mistreatment and unlawful killing, submitted by PIL and another law firm, Leigh Day.\nOnce the cases have been investigated by IHAT they can be submitted by the lawyers to Iraq Fatality Investigations – even if there was no evidence of wrongdoing. Of the four cases IFI has taken up, two have been concluded, each costing the taxpayer £200,000.\nIf all disputed deaths are referred to IFI it could cost the taxpayer more than £50million for the inquiry work alone.\nPIL has submitted the 1,154 claims as cases of alleged criminality. It is expected then to issue them as civil law claims – on grounds of negligence – and seek damages.\nAs many as 280 soldiers have been hounded by IHAT investigators over the past two years. Most of them will have already faced military investigations and been cleared. They received letters asking them to give evidence about incidents over a decade ago. Many were even quizzed on their doorsteps.\nOver the weekend it emerged that three soldiers who were cleared of manslaughter charges in 2006 now face the IFI – even though IHAT found no new evidence against them.\nThe MoD has so far paid out £21.77million in compensation to Iraqis after their cases were submitted to Abu Jamal in Basra, then passed on to PIL and Leigh Day. The Daily Mail tracked down Basra families who have claimed compensation through the father of one. Last night one of them, who has already received a pay-out, said: ‘We heard everyone hurt by the British forces and who is innocent is worthy of compensation.’\nThe man, who wants to keep his identity secret, said he received compensation in 2013 after he was mistaken for an insurgent, detained and allegedly tortured.\nAsked how much Abu Jamal was paid, he said: ‘We gave him his fees.’ His brother added: ‘He imposes a percentage from the total compensation.’ Last week the Mail revealed Abu Jamal was being paid £40,000 by the MoD to ferry around witnesses.\nAn MoD spokesman said: ‘It is a matter for law firms and their clients to decide whether to make compensation claims. The MoD contests vigorously claims which it does not believe to be valid and does everything appropriate to safeguard the legitimate interests of the taxpayer. The Government is also considering ways to reduce the burden on the armed forces of false claims.’\nPIL failed to return a request for comment.\nFive years of lawyers sifting through abuse claims... and ONE guilty soldier: Allegations team has completed just 18 cases\nWrongdoing has been shown in only one of the 1,500 allegations made against Britain’s Iraq veterans.\nThe Iraq Historic Allegations Team has completed just 18 cases in five years – and found a single instance of abuse. It resulted in a £3,000 fine.\nYet the team continues to pursue hundreds of other cases in which British soldiers could face the threat of charges of murder or assault.\nEven in such serious cases, it is struggling to gather sufficient evidence to show there had been any wrongdoing.\nThe Iraq Historic Allegations Team has completed just 18 cases in five years - and found a single instance of abuse which resulted in a £3,000 fine. Yet the team continues to pursue hundreds of other cases (file picture)\nThe Service Prosecuting Authority – the military equivalent of the Crown Prosecution Service – has revealed that in 35 alleged killings its advice has been sought by IHAT.\nAnd in a further 20 such cases, it says it is preparing to give its advice. Another 107 cases concern allegations of mistreatment and abuse. The ‘advice’ sought is routine discussion between investigators and prosecutors about the best way to handle a particular case.\nOnly two cases have ever been referred to the SPA by the Iraq Historic Allegations Team for decisions on whether to bring charges.\nAn SPA spokesman said that after considering whether there was a realistic prospect of conviction – and if it was in the public interest to do so – ‘the SPA has decided not to direct the bringing of charges in respect of those two cases’.\nTory MP Bob Stewart, a former Army colonel who sits on the Commons defence committee, said: ‘IHAT is irksome, irritating and upsetting for the Armed Forces. Its record is appalling. Soldiers hate going to court. Some have told me before they would prefer to be under fire.’\nIHAT is irksome, irritating and upsetting for the Armed Forces. Its record is appalling. Soldiers hate going to court. Some have told me before they would prefer to be under fire Tory MP Bob Stewart\nAndrew Cayley, QC, the director of the Service Prosecuting Authority, who has 20 years’ experience advising and prosecuting on war crimes cases, said: ‘I know very well what these crimes look like.\n‘Make no mistake, we will give all these IHAT cases the thorough scrutiny the law requires, and if prosecution is warranted we will not flinch from proceeding.\n‘Equally I want to make it absolutely clear that no member of the British Armed Forces will be prosecuted unless there is sufficient evidence to do so.’\nOf the 18 cases that IHAT has concluded, just one resulted in a soldier being proved to be in the wrong. It involved shocking video footage which appeared to show British soldiers beating an Iraqi civilian. The video was obtained by the Mail on Sunday in April 2011 and passed to military chiefs.\nIHAT says one of the soldiers was identified and admitted being responsible. He was referred to his commanding officer and fined £3,000 after a summary hearing.\nBut the remaining 17 cases failed to find any wrongdoing by British soldiers.\nExamples include the shooting of two Iraqis during a house search in November 2003. IHAT concluded: ‘No evidence soldier not acting in self-defence.’","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393168/No-end-witch-hunt-solicitors-hounding-heroes-plan-1-100-Iraq-War-damages-claims-troops-facing-FIVE-gruelling-legal-probes-single-allegation.html"}
