These practical finds on Amazon that have thousands of reviewers obsessing over them are either upgraded versions of products you already own, or they represent something completely new and different — so don't be surprised if they become modern classics.\nOne thing all of these genius products that practical people love have in common is that they solve problems — possibly even problems that are so common you have gotten used to living with them. You may expect that your sponge, dishcloth, or bath towel will accumulate mold and mildew and get smelly not long after you use it. But the odor-resistant alternatives on this list ensure you get more use out of these items and, over time, you'll spend less money replacing them.\nOther money-saving and space-saving practical products you'll find on this list include kitchen tools like a clip-on strainer that attached to pots and pans and will make your cumbersome colander obsolete, a device that cooks eggs in a flash, and a dashboard camera that can actually keep you safe while driving.\nThese products have unique features that help them stand on their own as practical and impressive — but add in the fact that they boast thousands of rave reviews, and you have even more of an excuse for why you need to start shopping ASAP.","url":"https://www.bustle.com/p/40-practical-finds-on-amazon-that-have-thousands-of-reviewers-obsessing-over-them-10214577"}
