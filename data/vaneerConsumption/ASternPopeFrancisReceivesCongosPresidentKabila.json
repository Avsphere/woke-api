President Kabila has delayed holding presidential elections and many fear that he means to eliminate them altogether, despite the fact that he cannot legally continue in office.\nThe focus of the dialogue, the Vatican said, was the “persistent violence suffered by the population in the east of the country” and the urgency of reestablishing civil co-existence.\nJust hours before the meeting, violence once more erupted in the capital city of Kinshasa, resulting in the deaths of some 100 persons.\nIn past days, the auxiliary bishop of Kinshasa, Donatien Bafuidinsoni, denounced the dramatic situation in the Congo, underscoring President Kabila’s responsibility for the crisis.\n“We are on the brink of a new global conflict,” Bafuidinsoni said. “If, as it seems, President Kabila will not hold elections and give up power after his two terms—as required by the Constitution—the whole country will fall into civil war.”\n“It is clear to everyone now that Kabila intends to hold onto power,” the bishop continued. “People cannot take it any longer, partly because his circle and a select few wealthy others have increased their wealth to frightening levels, while the vast majority of the population is floundering in poverty,” he said.\nIn mid-August, Pope Francis made reference to the beleaguered African state during his Angelus message. “My thoughts turn to the residents of North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo,” he said, “recently struck by new massacres which for some time have been perpetrated in shameful silence, without even attracting our attention.”\n“Sadly, these victims are part of the many innocent who have no bearing on world opinion,” he said.\nFollow Thomas D.
