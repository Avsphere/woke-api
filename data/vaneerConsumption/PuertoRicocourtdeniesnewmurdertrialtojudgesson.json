His wife, 46-year-old Carmen Paredes, was fatally shot at their home in a wealthy suburb.\nCasellas' father is U.S. District Court Judge Salvador Casellas, a former Puerto Rico treasury secretary appointed to the federal bench in 1994.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4448384/Puerto-Rico-court-denies-new-murder-trial-judges-son.html"}
