She eventually fell back into the studio couch and embraced the bout of laughter\nOne-woman show: Phil joked that she could read all of his cue cards, if she felt so inclined\n'I don't know what's happened to me,' she said, as she slumped back into the studio couch while Phil laughed at her. 'I'm so sorry!'\n'Do you wanna do the whole thing?' Phil asked Holly. 'Why don't you do the whole thing? It's fine. I don't get paid by the word... You carry on.'\nIt took for Britain's Next Top Model host Abbey to cut in on the impromptu merriment, as she asked them to stop making her laugh.\n'I can't laugh because of me wisdom tooth,' explained Liverpudlian mother-of-two, who's married to Stoke City striker Pete Crouch. 'It's swollen and it's hurting, so stop making me laugh!'\nWisdom: Guest Abbey Clancy cut in to reveal that their impromptu moment of merriment was actually causing her pain, as she'd just had her wisdom tooth removed","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4320626/Phillip-Schofield-jokes-Holly-having-babies.html"}
