And I cannot stress enough when he is doing it. He is doing it after the bombs sent around last week, after the anti-Semitic attacks last week. The president very much still directly engaged in this type of identity politics.”\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/10/30/cnns-berman-trump-calling-gillum-a-thief-is-a-racial-dog-whistle/"}
