The city's population, meanwhile, is 33 percent white and 52 percent female.\nThe study also found that the disparity is greater at bigger organizations and that more whites fill leadership and board positions.\nThe department will use the data to create programs aimed at boosting diversity in the arts.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3420951/NYC-arts-groups-dont-reflect-citys-diversity.html"}
