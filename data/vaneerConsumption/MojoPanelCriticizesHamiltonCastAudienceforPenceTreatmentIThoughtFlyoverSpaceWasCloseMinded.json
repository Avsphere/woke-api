But it was not a good night.” She added, “I thought it was the wrong thing to do.”\nRendell agreed, adding, “There have to be limits. Public officials have to have some space that’s off-limits.” Rendell and Brzezinski further added that holding a press conference or delivering a letter to Pence would have been fine.\n(h/t WFB)\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/11/21/mojo-panel-criticizes-hamilton-cast-audience-for-pence-treatment-i-thought-flyover-space-was-close-minded/"}
