It sank to 41 cents on Monday before the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading and said Arch shares would be delisted.\nThe company said Monday it has the cash reserves to continue mining operations. Arch has more than five billion tonnes of metallurgical and thermal coal reserves, mostly in the mid-Appalachian mountain zone of the eastern United States and in Colorado and Wyoming in the West.\n\"Today's announcement represents another significant step in our ongoing efforts to position the company for long-term success,\" said chairman and chief executive John Eaves in a statement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3394312/US-coal-miner-Arch-files-bankruptcy-hit-cheap-gas.html"}
