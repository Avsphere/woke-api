One bears India, and pushes north and east at a rate of about two centimetres (0.8 inches) per year against the other, which carries Europe and Asia.\nThis process created the Himalaya mountain range, and causes earthquakes when strain built up along the fault gives way periodically, thrusting the overlying landmass up and outward.\nThe study is the latest to warn of the risk of another major quake around Nepal's Gorkha district, near the epicentre of a 7.8-magnitude tremor on April 25 -- the worst in Nepal in more than 80 years. It was followed on May 12 by a 7.3-strong aftershock.\nA study in the same journal warned just five months ago that last year's tremors had only partially relieved stress on the length of the fault line, and said chances for a big tremor were as high as before.\nThe twin quakes killed more than 8,700 people, triggered landslides and destroyed half a million homes, leaving hundreds of thousands in need of food, clean water and shelter.\n\"Unfortunately, there is no way of predicting precisely when another earthquake will take place,\" Elliot added.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3394237/Quake-fault-straining-underneath-Kathmandu-study.html"}
