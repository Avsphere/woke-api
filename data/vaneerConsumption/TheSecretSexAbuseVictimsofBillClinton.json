Bill Clinton, like Bill Cosby, has been enabled by the powerful and by a retinue of flunkeys that profit from Clinton’s high status. Just a mere year ago, despite knowing 13 women had gone on record with claims that Cosby had abused them, the executives at NBC were on the verge of giving the then-77 year-old comedian yet another TV sitcom. Now, a year later, after 50 women victims have come forward, Bill Cosby’s celebrity and fatherly image have justifiably been destroyed and he may forever be thought of as one of the most famous serial rapists in American history.\nBill Clinton is in a similar situation. The public knows all about Clinton’s alleged rape of Juanita Broaddrick from her tearful account on national TV in 1999. They also know that a red-faced Clinton allegedly exposed himself to Paula Jones in May 1991, and asked her to “kiss” his erection. What many people do not know is that when this became public in 1993, all Paula Jones wanted was an apology from Clinton and not a penny.[i] Clinton’s response was that he did not even know her. Later in 1998, Clinton ended up paying Paula Jones a whopping $850,000 for his behavior, which was compounded by his lying.\nLikewise people know about Kathleen Willey, an alleged victim of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. According to Willey, in November 1993 a red-faced Bill sexually assaulted her in the Oval Office. Later, because she was deposed as a material witness in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, Hillary reportedly used nasty private detectives to run a terror campaign of witness tampering on Willey. We’d call it a Hillary-sponsored psychological rape of Willey.[ii]\nVicious private detective Jack Palladino allegedly bragged about being hired by Hillary to intimidate Willey.\nAll of this raises the question: how many more sexual victims of Bill Clinton are out there? The common theme among many of Bill Cosby’s sex victims was that they did not want to challenge a rich, powerful and popular public figure. People at the level of Cosby and Clinton have an army of lawyers, PR people and nasty private detectives who they use to crush any woman who would dare to tell the truth about them.\nThe Washington Post’s Roger Morris, Newsweek’s Michael Isikoff (now with NBC), and former Clinton Military Aide Buzz Patterson all have written about Bill Clinton’s other anonymous alleged sex abuse victims.\nCapitol Hill Blue interviewed other secret alleged sex abuse victims of Bill Clinton. According to Capitol Hill Blue, in 1972, while Bill was dating Hillary at Yale Law School, a 22-year-old woman told campus police that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her.She confirmed the assault to Capitol Hill Blue but did not want her name used. Clinton was still president in 1999 when the article was written.\nBill Clinton’s trail of alleged attacks dates back even further to the University of Arkansas, where he was a law instructor. There, Clinton allegedly sexually attacked a female student, groped her and tried to physically trap her in his office. This secret sex victim of Clinton also confirmed her attack to Capitol Hill Blue. She is not alone. Other former Arkansas students confirmed that Clinton tried to force himself on them when he was a professor, according to the article’s authors Daniel J. Harris & Teresa Hampton.\nAnother alleged secret sex victim of Clinton was identified by journalist Roger Morris, who wrote in Partners In Power, his book about the Clintons:\nA young woman lawyer in Little Rock claimed that she was accosted by Clinton while he was attorney general and that when she recoiled he forced himself on her, biting and bruising her. Deeply affected by the assault, the woman decided to keep it all quiet for the sake of her own hard-won career and that of her husband. When the husband later saw Clinton at the 1980 Democratic Convention, he delivered a warning. “If you ever approach her,” he told the governor, “I’ll kill you.” Not even seeing fit to deny the incident, Bill Clinton sheepishly apologized and duly promised never to bother her again.[iii]\nNote: Bill Clinton is alleged to have bitten the victim who described her ordeal to Roger Morris. According to Juanita Broaddrick, while Clinton assaulted her in 1978 he savagely bit, tore and bloodied her upper lip. He also allegedly bit the reigning Miss America Liz Ward Gracen in 1983–who, by the way, was married at the time. Gracen told Michael Isikoff, then of Newsweek, that Bill Clinton had bit her and tearfully told her best friend, Judy Stokes, that then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton had raped her. Publicly, a terrified Gracen has said that her sex with Clinton was consensual, but she privately maintains Clinton raped her.[iv]\nAnother alleged secret sex abuse victim of Bill Clinton, the wife of a prominent Democrat, contacted Michael Isikoff, who wrote in his book Uncovering Clinton (p. 162) about what he did to this (also married) woman in the Oval Office in 1996:\nClinton started getting physical, trying to kiss her, touching her breasts. The woman said she was stunned. She had no idea how to respond. “I’ve never had a man take advantage of me like that” … As Clinton pressed himself on her, she said, she resisted–and finally pushed him away. What happened after that? I asked. Clinton turned away, she said. She hesitated, and she said softly and with apparent discomfort, “I think he finished the job himself.”[v]\nLt. Col. Robert “Buzz” Patterson, the military attaché who used to carry the “nuclear football” in the Clinton White House, wrote a book about Clinton called Dereliction of Duty. Not only does Patterson describe Hillary as an abusive, yelling, ultra-profane harpy, he also tells the story about yet another alleged secret sex victim of Bill Clinton. Patterson recounts:\n“Buzz, we have a problem,” he [Lt. Col. Mark Donnelly, a presidential pilot] said grimly. “One of my female stewards claims she was approached and touched inappropriately by President Clinton and she’s upset.” I knew the woman Mark was referring to, and I liked her. She was bright, cheery, and beautiful. She was also an enlisted member of the United States Air Force — and had just, apparently, been sexually molested by the commander in chief. “Where did this happen, Mark?” “In one of the galleys on Air Force One on a recent trip. Apparently, he cornered her.” “Is she going to come forward? How does she want to handle it?” “She’s really upset but she doesn’t want this to get out. She just wants an apology.”[vi]\nThis raises the same question asked about the other famous “Bill”: just how many secret Clinton sex abuse victims have there been? Like Cosby, using his power and intimidation to sexually abuse and degrade women appears to have been a lifestyle choice for this other Bill over a course of decades.\nBill Clinton also allegedly tried to have sex with Chelsea’s nanny back in the mid-1980s, when his daughter was about age 4 or 5. Chelsea’s then-nanny, Becky, at the time was the girlfriend of Bill Clinton’s favorite state trooper, L. D. Brown. L.D. Brown describes this in his book Crossfire: Witness in the Clinton Investigation:\nBecky had been baby-sitting Chelsea and had already put her to bed. Bill, after getting a beer, found Becky watching television in the upstairs part of the Mansion. He slouched down next to Becky and offered her a beer. Incredibly, he began his “I’m so bad” routine with Becky! I had seen him use it time and time again to get a woman to comfort him – comforting which he then manipulated into eventual sex. Becky got out of there in a hurry.[vii]\nThese are the known alleged secret sex abuse victims of Bill Clinton. Like the alleged victims of Bill Cosby, many of them are too scared to come forward and go public. In our book The Clintons’ War on Women we honor the accounts and provide a voice to women who, until now, have been silenced by the Clintons.\n[i] Candice Jackson, Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine, p. 115.\n[ii] Kathleen Willey, Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
