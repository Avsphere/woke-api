The Menlo Park, California, company plans to extend the iPhone feature to all 1.6 billion of its worldwide users during the next few weeks.\nThe live video option is coming out after nearly two months of testing in the U.S.\nThe feature will enable Facebook users to share live video of their adventures and other more mundane activities with friends and family. It's similar to the live video app called Periscope that Twitter introduced on its messaging service last year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3421545/Facebook-flips-switch-live-video-iPhone-app.html"}
