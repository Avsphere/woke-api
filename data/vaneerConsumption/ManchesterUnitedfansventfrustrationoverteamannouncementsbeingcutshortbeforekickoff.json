Van Gaal's line-up then comes second in a bid to rouse the crowd.\nManchester United fans have written to the club asking for the pre-kick-off schedule to be changed\nManchester United stadium announcer Alan Keegan (right) interviews Rory McIlroy in August 2014\nPre-match music and entertainment lingers on so much, however, that a portion of the United 18 cannot be broadcast on a regular basis, beaten by the referee's first whistle.\nIt has led to some fans writing in to United to ask why the schedule cannot be switched.\nThe club could make a move to completely forgo announcing the away team or read out United's first.\nVan Gaal is presiding over the club's worst ever Premier League campaign.\nAnd the Dutchman said on Thursday he could see out the remainder of his three-year contract thanks to boardroom backing.\n'Everybody knows I have signed a three-year contract,' said Van Gaal.\nManager Louis van Gaal expects to see out the remainder of the three-year contract he signed 18 months ago\n'It's a process, not one game, and I want to continue until the end. If I wasn't willing to do that, I don't think I would have started here. I am always fighting.\n'Of course I'm very happy with the support of Ed Woodward and the Glazers. But when the board has such confidence in you, the pressure is higher than when they say it is your last game. Then your confidence is not so high and you can fight against it. And when you fight you have a bigger motivation than when they support you.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3422438/Manchester-United-fans-vent-frustration-Old-Trafford-PA-announcer-regularly-cutting-short-team-line-up.html"}
